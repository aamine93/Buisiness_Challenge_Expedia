travel,Expedia is charging me for increased ticket prices AFTER I bought the ticket,"Hello everyone,

I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this on. If not, please let me know.

I booked a flight with Expedia a month ago. I received a confirmation email and money was deducted from my Visa card. Fast forward to yesterday when I was on the phone with Expedia about a refund that I had not received for another trip (even after waiting for the refund for over a month). During this call, the agent says something incredibly concerning. He says ""Oh, I see you have an upcoming trip booked. I am making you aware that some of your tickets for this trip are not confirmed and to do so you will have to pay more money"". I was confused. I asked him why I need to pay and he said because the tickets were not confirmed and the ticket prices keep fluctuating. I told him I already paid for my trip and I even received a confirmation email. He says I still need to pay extra to confirm the flight. I asked him how much and he said I woud have to pay an extra 725 dollars. I was incredibly upset and confused. I'm a law student in Ohio and I am currently not earning any money. I booked this trip to fly back to Asia to go home. You can imagine how hard of a position this puts me in, especially since I made further travel plans based on this trip. I explain all this to the agent, he doesn't budge. He simply says I can cancel the flight and I'll get a refund or I can pay the extra 725 now to confirm the flight. He also said if I choose to go to the airport on the day of my flight, the airline desk there will charge me the 725 + any extra fees like handling fees! I ask to speak to his manager. He connects me with his manager. I explain my case to him. He apparently calls American Airlines and then he tells me he managed to bring the extra amount down from 725 dollars to 525 dollars since I'm a student. I plead with him but he doesn't budge, he simply keeps repeating that I have to buy the extra amount or I can get a refund. Note that I had initially called them to ask about a refund which I had called about a month ago, so at this point I really don't trust their promise of a refund. He keeps saying this is not Expedia's fault but the airline's (American Airlines) for increasing the price during a high demand for tickets period (basically a few days before Christmas).

How is this legal? I even asked him that and explained I paid for my trip and received a confirmation email but they're trying to make me pay more for something I already paid for? Do you guys have any advice on what to do? Sorry for the long post/rant. I'm super stressed right now since my final exams are approaching and now I need to deal with Expedia screwing me over like this :(

P.S: I have booked intercontinental flights with Expedia many times in the past and this is the first time something so absurd has happend to me. I will never use Expedia again, and I caution you fine folk to do the same.

  
Update: Thanks for all the responses and support! I felt a lot better after posting here and heeding the advice from the comments I reached out to American Airlines and they told me that all of my flights and tickets are confirmed and I have nothing to worry about. I asked them multiple times if I have to pay any extra fees when I check in at the airport and they said no. I did ask them to lock my reservation but they said the airline in charge of the trip is Japan Airlines and I need to contact them for that. I am now trying to contact them.

Update 2: A lot of people are saying I may have been scammed since I was emailed a confirmation code and read it to them. While that is a possibility I would like to clarify that no, I did not google the number for expedia. I had contacted them through the chat on their website first and asked for their number. I then called that number and spoke to an expedia agent about using airline credits. This expedia agent also sent a confirmation code email to me to confirm who I was. This expedia agent then gave me a different number to call in case we got disconnected during the process of requesting a refund, which did happen. I called the other number the expedia agent provided and he was the same guy. Before I ended the call he told me to call that number again if I had not received my refund after 15-20 business days. This was a little more than a month ago. 2 days ago I called that same number the expedia agent provided me, which was also the one I called last time. But just in case, I did sign my expedia account out of every device and changed my password.

travel,"I booked a hotel with Expedia in Mexico only to find out when we arrived, the hotel rooms were sold out?","My family and I booked a family vacation 8 months before departure using Expedia.  When we arrived to Mexico, the hotel told us all 3 of the rooms we booked were sold out.  We were given 3 single bed bedrooms instead, causing two men (my brothers) to sleep together.  We were not happy AT ALL and our rooms smelled like mold.  We did an early check out, but the hotel is now denying that we checked out early.  Luckily I took photos of the form the concierge gave us to fill out and sign.  We were instructed to give it to her and she would give it to management (who conveniently wasn't present on site the entire day we needed help).   The hotel is now denying everything because they didn't sign it and have no records of us checking out early.  We are being asked to still pay the full amount for 4 nights although we only stayed for one.   My bank is siding with the hotel and Expedia is acting like there's nothing they can do.

travel,Airbnb host can cancel any time and it's your problem - be careful,"I'm a very well traveled guy, also a resort manager, been in different situations. However, I've just found out that Airbnb reservation can be canceled by a host just like that, two days before arrival. ""Here's your refund, off you go"". Mind you, this is Memorial weekend - everything is booked, prices are through the roof by now.

If we cancel a booking from Expedia or any other OTA (say, due to a rare overbooking situation, an issue with a room or something), the OTA looks for an alternative and we have to cover the guest's relocation cost to a comparable (or better) resort. Not the case with Airbnb - you get zero support, you're on your own.

So imagine: you have a flight overseas with your family and friends, and boom - the host cancels :) I'm definitely going to be more careful when booking Airbnb in the future - now that I know this is their policy.

What's also interesting is that Airbnb actually charges the host a hefty penalty for the cancellation, they just keep the money while you're left to overpay for your stay now :)))",2305,495,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1cz9ekv/airbnb_host_can_cancel_any_time_and_its_your/,2024-05-24 01:37:21,Expedia

Expedia offered to cover a different hotel in the same area, and cover any additional cost. I contacted Expedia and booked a different hotel through them, and they did cover a small additional cost.

I contacted expedia and explained the situation, they promised to contact the hotel and handle this for me. After two days, I recieved an email from Expedia that the hotel was refusing to refund the reservation and they were very sorry but there was nothing they can do. I asked that they refund me the cost, as it is a result of miscommunication between the hotel and them that caused the expense. They have not replied to my email. 

Do I have any recourse here? I can dispute the charge, but what it seems like is Expedia mistakenly cancelled the booking without telling them. It's possible they were completely legit.

The location was indeed closed at 3 pm according to their website. However, should Expedia allow the booking to happen?! They were not supposed to allow the booking to happen!

travel,"Beware Expedia's ""fully refundable"" scam","Update: United has issued a travel certificate worth an equivalent amount which can be used to book future flights. Thank goodness we have come to a solution. 

I wish to thank everyone who offered advice to me. I'm so grateful for your help.

\----------------------------------------

I paid HK$24,814 (\~US$3170) in June for a ""fully refundable"" Hong Kong-Vancouver economy ticket for my mom. The price is more than double what a non-refundable ticket would cost. I (naively) paid such premium for flexibility coz my mom was not quite sure of her schedule.

The words ""fully refundable"" featured prominently on the ""review fare"" page leading to payment on the Expedia app, and I took a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/NdLFAxa). After paying, I even called United Airlines to confirm that the ticket is fully refundable.

Last week, about one month before the Oct 18 flight, I decided to cancel it and get refund coz my mom had a change of schedule. But Expedia **refused** to make any refund, insisting it's non-refundable. The trick is that they sent me a confirmation email shortly after my purchase, which I did not read through to the end and which contained the word ""non-refundable"". This is ridiculous. Selling a ticket as refundable (for double the normal price) and then sending a confirmation email stating the opposite? This is a scam, and I've become the sucker.

I called United last week and they said the money I paid was being held in Hong Kong on the Expedia side. They also said I can get my money back if Expedia submits a refund request to United via the ""BSP Link"". But Expedia **refused** to take this step.

Other excuses cooked up by Expedia include that one leg of the flight is being operated by another airline. But the entire ticket was sold to me as ""fully refundable"", with no signs saying which leg is not refundable.

Something fishy is going on, and I suspect there's systematic fraud. Now when I search for a similar United flight on Expedia, I notice the wording has changed to ""partially refundable"" from ""fully refundable"".

If anyone has run into a similar situation with Expedia, pls feel free to message me and share your experience (or email me at [fox2004@gmail.com](mailto:fox2004@gmail.com)). Pls don't take it lying down. We can make a joint effort to seek justice. I'm preparing to file a complaint with regulators like FTC or BBB. I also plan to reach out to financial media and those interested in travel/consumer issues, as well as stock analysts covering EXPE.

Taking these steps can be very time-consuming, and I'm not doing it just for the money.

travel,I'll never use booking.com ever again - and you should not either,"Just a rant - sorry. We booked a hotel for the total solar eclipse way ahead of time (December 17th). The hotel called me a month before the eclipse (outside of [booking.com](http://booking.com) communication channels) and requested that I approve a date change (because they just realized they are overbooked). Obviously to a date outside the eclipse. I declined.  
They send me an email through the [booking.com](http://booking.com) system with a one-click ""please confirm if you’d like to cancel this booking"" link, followed immediately with a ""YOUR ROOM RESERVATION HAS BEEN CANCELLED"".

I called the hotel to complain and they told me to contact [booking.com](http://booking.com) - the hotel claimed it's the mistake of [booking.com](http://booking.com) because they advertised a wrong rate.

So I contacted [booking.com](http://booking.com) - and I was not prepared for how terrible their customer support is.

It took me hours on the phone, multiple managers and superviors, emails and call backs to finally reach someone who was ""allowed"" to make a decision on the case. I was told on the phone that I can book a new hotel of the same class, and [booking.com](http://booking.com) will refund the difference in price. Just a month out from the solar eclipse, any other hotel was obviously way more expensive now - over $300 more expensive to be exact. This was communicated to [booking.com](http://booking.com) multiple times. And this was acknoledge by [booking.com](http://booking.com) multiple times on the phone.

Because of the messy experience over the few days with their customer support, I requested the resolution in writing. I was told I will receive an email confirmation and we ended the call. Again, I was not prepared for how terrible their customer support is. The email I received stated:

>!We are happy to see that your trip is back on track!  We can work on a refund for the price difference of your stay, up to a maximum of 25 EUR.!<

I called them again, for the 20th time (not exaggurating) - and I still feel bad for the poor representative that day. It ended up being a 3 hour call of ""No call backs. No more bullshitting. Get whomever you need on the phone to sort this shit out now."" ... which actually worked, which is the saddest part of the story. I don't want to be rough and rude to people to arrive at a resolution. The result was an email stating:

>!We can work on a refund for the price difference of your stay, up to a maximum of 361.69 USD. All you need to do is send us the invoice for your alternative accommodation.!<

So I did. 4 weeks ago, just a week after the eclipse, I forwarded the $333.50 invoce via a response to the email I received from [booking.com](http://booking.com), which had a custom support sender address linked to my account, booking reference in the subject, everything. I gave them a May 1st due date to process the refund. And waited. To no avail. No response. No refund.

So I called them. And again I was unprepared for how shitty they are.

Call 1: They (pretended to?) be unable to hear me and hung up.

Call 2: Friendly, to the point, understood the issue, claimed they never received anything, gave me a new email address to send documents to. I did, they acknoledged that my email was received, I asked for a one-liner in response to confirm in writing that the email was received. ""absolutely, give me just a minute"" was followed by 30 minutes of silence and the call got disconnected. No email was received.

Call 3: They (pretended to?) be unable to understand what my issue was, claimed they have to get in contact with the refunds department, I was placed on hold music mid sentence, and the call was disconnected 20 minutes later.

Call 4: Friendly, request for a supervisor was declined because she wanted to try and help me first, took a bit more time to make them understand the issue, but in the end she said she will be able to send me an email confirmation and asked if she can put me on hold - I declined, because I was hung up on two times tonight while being on hold. So I listened to her typing for 20 minutes. She told me that she sent the email to me and wanted to disconnect the call. I asked her to wait on the line until I actually receive the email, and her immediate response was: >!oh, sorry, I sent it to the wrong email address, my mistake.!<

She corrected her mistake(?) and I received the email saying ""We received your latest email regarding the documents for the refund.""

* some sites like Expedia have reward programs if you go through them - but that may be moot with the right credit card and airline or hotel reward program

travel,Expedia shared my full credit card details with a hotel. Is this normal?,"This year, we visited Turkey and booked several hotels for our trip, some through Expedia since they had better rates. Everything seemed fine until we checked into a hotel in Istanbul, and there was confusion about whether we had already paid for our stay.

We had multiple bookings, so I wasn’t tracking payments perfectly, but I was under the impression that this one was prepaid. The receptionist, however, insisted we hadn’t paid and, to convince me, invited me to look at his computer screen.

To my shock, right there on his screen were all my Amex card details—card number, expiration date, and CVV—completely visible. My mind froze. I double-checked, and yes, the details matched my card. I immediately asked, “How do you have access to my full card details?”

His response? A casual reassurance that only he has access to this information, provided by Expedia, to ensure they can charge the card if needed.

Seriously, Expedia? Why are you handing over my sensitive card details in full? I understand allowing the hotel to charge when necessary, but that can be done securely bt encrypting the card info. How can you trust every hotel in the world to keep my card details safe?

What’s stopping an employee from leaking my details to someone who can use my card anywhere, with no way to trace it back? This feels like a massive security oversight.

Have others experienced this? How is this even acceptable in 2024?

I book the rental and it occurs to me that I should call the Sixt location that EXPEDIA GAVE ME (keep that in mind) to make sure I have everything in order when it's time to pick up. However, because Expedia gave me the airport location, they said I needed a return flight/bus/train ticket in order to actually receive the rental. I'm thrown off because Expedia didn't ask me for any extra info like that and I was confused to why they even gave that location. They said in order to switch locations, I need to call Expedia. After 10 minutes of wrestling their garbage chat bot just to get an actual rep and ask them to switch. They say it's gonna take a bit too much time, so I just request to cancel it. They say I'd need to pay a $100 fee to do so even though a.) it had been less than an hour since I booked it and b.) this situation is their fault. They email Sixt to see if they can move locations and a few hours later, they email me saying they couldn't for whatever reason.

After a few days and a back and forth between them and Sixt, I end up going to the location the day of the pickup and try to plead with the manager of the airport location and try to explain to her what happened. She feels bad and promises to comp any fee and get my money back. I call expedia and they promise the same thing. Next day, their email to me: ""sry we can't get ur refund :( plz email us back with any questions"" Livid, I do just that. An hour later: ""Our inbox is full so we won't get your message :(""

travel,Expedia - Fully Refundable vs Not Package Holiday - New York (UK),"Hello all,

I’m looking to book New York for my GF’s 30th birthday and we have looked for a while now and are beginning to get overwhelmed by the choices🤣

We have noticed that some packages are fully refundable and others charge quite a lot to be fully refundable (sometimes £200pp+). 

So my question is, is this just insuring against cancellations that you pay no cancellation charge? And if so, is this specific to the hotel you stayed in? Also, what happens to the flights?

My GF seems to think that we lose all our money if we cancel, which to me is bonkers and simply must be wrong..

Be good to hear from people who have experience here.

He received a confirmation email with the eDreams logo from an email address at [tripcustomercare.com](http://tripcustomercare.com), which includes all booking details and a confirmation number.

No one he spoke to was able to pull up any booking using that confirmation number, or his name. When he asked to speak to a supervisor, he was given a phone number with the Philippines country code. Then I noticed on our credit card statement that the booking was billed by Expedia. To my knowledge, Expedia does not own eDreams. He called the Expedia number from the credit card statement, and they were also not able to pull up his reservation.

Called Expedia and told me they can not do anything.,"I have been having an anxiety attack over it and I need some honest response. 

Me and my wife (from Japanese nationality) booked a flight from Tokyo To Seattle using Hawaiian Airlines and one from Seattle to Tokyo with 3hour overlay time in Seoul.

The problem is, that on the return ticket my wife's first name and surname are inverted.

 I called Asiana and they told me that it was  Expedia's mistake, to call them for them to make the correction because there is a possibility that my wife will not be able to get a the ticket at the counter or even board the plane.

Long story short.

Called Expedia 2 times 

First time they asked me to send the correct order of the names, and my wife's passport photo in a PDF in an Email they sent me. I did as they told, but they got back to me on an Email saying that because it is a co-shared flight with Hawaiian Airlines they can not make the change.

The second time I called  I explained the same thing and told Expedia what the other person told me on the phone. But in this case the lady told me that it is totally possible to change the orders of the names on the reservation. She asked me for 72 hours to make the change. 

  
What I don't understand is which is it??  I made the right inputs when buying the tickets, tripled checked and they are wrong.

  
Has anyone has had this problem before? and what would happen if they are not able to change the names. is it really that strict to not let a passenger board a plane just because their names are inverted?

“Unfortunately, after speaking with _______, they're holding to the original policy for your booking and declined the request.”

Naturally I called the hotel and asked why I wasn’t allowed to change and they were perplexed and said that they approved it, and told Expedia to make the change and refund.

I called Expedia and explained the situation and at first they were understanding, and said all they needed to do was call and confirm. Then they came back on the line and claimed to have called the hotel and said they, again, wouldn’t change the reservation (I made sure to give them the correct phone number and name of agent). I pressed them on what they said and they said something about a language barrier and said there was nothing else I could do.

CLEARLY I called the hotel back and told them what happened and they were again frustrated and confused and said that since it was booked via Expedia that an Expedia rep would need to make the necessary changes on their end and issue the refund on the single day.

Uh…what is the next step here. I don’t want to cancel this reservation, as the rates have changed and we are looking forward to this hotel being one of the major highlights of the trip.

travel,Absolute disastrous experience with Expedia,"Back in January, my wife and I booked our flights to Lisbon through Expedia and received confirmation that my reservation was booked along with the ticket number and all that. Fast forward to the night before my travel date in May, when I tried to check in through the airline, I could not check in for some reason (but my wife could). I called Expedia's customer support in the morning and after taking 2+ hours figuring what went on, they told me to contact the airline directly because they did not see my ticket in the system. So I called the airline directly, but they could not figure out the issue, so they assisted me to call back Expedia. As I was heading into the airport, 5 hours before my flight, I was on call with the customer support and Expedia still could not figure out how to address this issue and told me to re-book another flight completely at my own expense. Taking 8+ hours of ""assistance"", the only option they provided was the partial refund of $1,000 when my trip costed $1,424. I then had to find the best available flight for the next day and spent $2,000 (direct booking with the airline this time) for the tickets that I would not have needed if Expedia booked the original tickets as confirmed. I ended up losing significant amount of money on extra tickets, a day of travel and time with my family.

I was utterly shocked at 1) how Expedia made a mistake like this (no tickets booked with a reservation) and 2) how poorly they assisted me through this process. My expectation was that they would provide the best available flights at their expense or at least offer a full refund plus compensation equaling unnecessary expenses incurred due to this issue.

travel,Booking with Expedia Question,"I am traveling to Tromso, Norway from Oct 1 to 6. We arrive around 5pm on the first and leave early mornign on the 6th, to travel to Oslo. I have planned to do Aurora hunt tours, and maybe the reindeer/Sami visit, visit a Husky farm, and a Fjord Boat cruise. I booked our hotel through Expedia, but decided to try and book some activities as well. I have never booked anything besides hotels with them.

I went ahead and booked an aurora minibus tour. Since then, I've seen a few other travel websites and reviews of how the tour/activity operator never received anything from the respective websites, and the people were out of luck. Has anyone any experience booking with Expedia? Is it a legit way to reserve a spot on a tour/excursion?

travel,Expedia/ Egencia Dispute,"Unfortunately, corporate fraud / wrong doing is a standard business practice  as long as it is still profitable when you get caught . It was my time to experience it. 

Here’s the timeline of my experience .

1. Their  website  crashed (not responding) and I ended up having an additional booking room booking for $1200. It was a non refundable booking listing on their site and I did not get a separate email for booking . I did not know about it at all . 
2. Radisson refunded them the money the very next day the other room was not check in.  I did not know about this till 13 months later.
3. I disputed with them and Citibank. Citibank threw me under the bus as they don’t have any chargeback agreement with them and I lost the case. Initial dispute  was within the time period . 
4. Egencia told me that hotel refused to make a refund. I called the hotel and they told me that they wanted them to refund commission they charged them. Radisson tried to help . 
5. I was at the same hotel 13 months after and they were able to locate the refund they made.
6. After I told Egencia  after I told Agent that this is a borderline scam, they refunded my money right away  that this is a borderline scam, they refunded my money right away. They have denied any wrong doing and called it a courtesy credit . 

In summary, they have lied  to MasterCard and Citibank on legal paperwork.. I have spent over 20 hours trying to get money back and I was about to give up as it was going to be healthier to let it go. 
I have probably less than hundred dollar wasted on phone bills and lost on interest I could have gained on $1200 in a year. (If i were to invest the money in savings account )

How can I trigger an investigation? A hefty fine I hope will fix the issue . 

I appreciate everyone’s feedback . I often move forward with life, but if someone prior  who were in my situation were to pursue what I am doing now , my life could have been less stressful. I’m sure they are committing this scam and it’s highly profitable .

If you’re an attorney in California and make a difference in the life of consumers you can message me as well. 
If I do not receive any better response, I’m going to file a complaint with FTC and district attorney of California . I am confident if they dig deeper they’re gonna find dirt.",0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ehz086/expedia_egencia_dispute/,2024-08-02 02:35:09,Expedia

I booked a flight roundtrip from Pittsburgh to Mexico City. The flight leaves next week. I thought I had made every possible precaution, but overlooked the issue of an increase in elevation. Due to medical reasons, my doctor has advised me that i should not travel to this due to the altitude. 

Before I continue, I want to mention that i am well aware that i should have booked directly through the airline and not a third party like expedia. I know it provides complications and is mostly never a good idea. However, its a long story but for reasons pretty out of my control, this was the only method i could use to purchase the trip. 

Anyways, I contacted American Airlines and they said that since the flight is basic economy, they will provide no refund or trip credit. They told me to contact expedia for a trip credit. 
I contacted expedia and it was the same answer.  They told me to contact American Airlines for a trip credit. Both of them are directing me to the other but it seems none will offer any help.

The resort says, and most likely most other resorts are the same, that anyone over 13 is charged at a higher price, probably because they eat a lot more.  In any case, as this is one of the core functions of Expedia i.e. booking hotels and resorts, shouldn't they have taken this into consideration that one of my children need to pay more?

Now month after month pass and NO REFUND. Its been past the promised 3 month and no refund. When calling expedia they ""laugh at us"" and say you need to speak with lufthansa. When calling Lufthansa the say you need to speak to Expedia for the refund. When talking to the bank they say you need to speak to lufthansa to get a confirmation that they received the request to refund to dispute it. Now we are in a loop of shifting responsibility and a lot o money lost. All due to the incompetent and mismanaged team of expedia that I have been waiting for weeks to get a call back from a manager. 

Please be advised of this it might save you so much time and so much money. If you can book it yourself do so, at least you can dispute the transactio  yourself and not have to deal with rude and incompetent individuals who will hang up on you while you are politely asking for their help to solve the situation.

Avoid at all cost. If you have the option to pay 100$ more or even 200$ more for knowing you have control over your money and the bank. its worth it, because otherwise you might be down 22 hours of phone time bieng put on hold, the energy to endure that as well as the price of multiple airplane tickets!!!

Buy with caution, its truly despicable what goes on at expedia.


**** update **** I have a email trace documenting every call I had with the call center from expedia. I used that email trace and the policy of Lufthansa to try again with the bank and dispute the charges. I also recorded the call with lufthansa where they refused to give me any information about my refund but by doing that they confirmed that there is a refund there.

travel,Expedia Scam Warning,"I recently had to book through Expedia because the hotel I wanted used Expedia for their US booking.

Expedia has a website error for certain bookings where the add on updates the nightly hotel rate. For example, a hotel might include a breakfast option for $10. So Expedias options would be $200/night or $220/night with breakfast. When this sort of option appears, Expedia will not recognize the ""with breakfast"" confirmation after booking. It will just show up as you booking a night for $220. So essentially you will pay $20 more for no additional benefit. Stay 5 days and you are out $100. It will not show up in their system and it will be hard to argue because rates change everyday, so it's not easy to prove you selected breakfast. The hotel will not see it on their systems.

Just a warning since this happened to me. The hotel could not see it in their system and Expedia just denies I selected the option. But doing another test booking shows no indication of breakfast selected at the final confirmation page either.

I contacted with Expedia immediately and they told me this is cancelation policy of the hotel so Expedia doesn’t have authority to override the policy of the hotel. And if i was charged by penalty, it should be charged by the hotel directly instead of Expedia. 

After that I contacted with the hotel, and the hotel told me that they only charge deposit as penalty if customers cancel the reservation within 3 days before check-in day. So in this case, the hotel confirmed that they won’t charge anything.

Then, I emailed Expedia about what the hotel's reply  and asked Expedia to contact the hotel to confirm the accurate policy.

Expedia responded my email and said they are unable to contact with the hotel now…

I don’t understand why such a famous and big company is unable to contact with a hotel but they still allow their customer to order the hotel on their website even though they don’t have correct and timely policy updates and cannot contact with the hotel

A really bad experience on Expedia unprofessional platform

Some people questioned if i checked cancellation policy when i made the order. Here is the cancellation policy presents on Expedia:

“Cancellations or changes made after 4:00 p.m. (property local time) on Dec 17, 2023 or no-shows are subject to a property fee equal to the first nights rate plus taxes and fees.”

See, the penalty should be charged if I cancel the reservation after December 17, which aligns with the policy of hotel.

travel,Expedia is a nightmare,"So before I get into this, I am totally aware of my mistakes in this situation. But Expedia is an absolute nightmare, and I'd say a scam. We purchased a package from them that included the airfare and hotel in the US Virgin Islands. Once we got it, we never really dug into it, assuming everything was good. Finally the day of the trip comes and during our layover we start looking at the hotel for a taxi. Somehow, Expedia booked us a flight to the completely wrong island. After calling them and not getting anywhere, we told them to cancel the room and submit a waiver request to the hotel, hoping we could explain the entire situation to them and they would have pity on us. Fast forward an hour expedia emails us saying the hotel denied the request. Being on the plane, I just plan on calling once we check into the new hotel. Once I called the hotel and told them about the situation, they informed me that Expedia had not contacted them at all. They also stated this was not the first time that Expedia had done this, and they'd be more than happy to waive it as soon as they get the request. Now, every email with Expedia is a literal copied email saying 

""Thank you for contacting Expedia for your request. We are sorry to hear about the inconvenience you have experienced. 

We understand your frustration over the refund denial, and as much as we would like to accommodate your request again, one of our agents already advocated the issue with the hotel representative accordingly. We need to comply with the policies of the vendors whose services we sell, and we have no authority to circumvent or to override those policies.""
 
I don't want them to circumvent anything. I just want them to properly request a waiver over email, which Expedia said they would do so we can get our money back.

Edit to add, we thought the hotel was St Thomas since that was the only flights Expedia was offering us when buying the package. The hotel was on St. Croix.

travel,Expedia Advisory ,"I recently needed to cancel a reservation made through Expedia. I had purchased traveler’s insurance and requested the refund via email. The refund was denied. When I questioned the reason, I was told:

Hello Bruce,

Thanks for contacting Expedia regarding refund request for your Hotel Booking Protection associated on your unused hotel booking with The Rochester Inn, A Historic Hotel. Please be advised that lodging insurance plans can be cancelled and refunded if all of these are true:

• The traveler bought the insurance within the last 15 days. The 15-day look begins on the effective date of the insurance, which is the date purchased.
• The trip has not started yet.
• The traveler has not filed an insurance claim.

We have noticed that you purchased the insurance last 08 FEB 2024. In line with this, the insurance is already non refundable.

Sincerely,

Jude V.
ILOJvilla
Expedia Customer Support

The refund was requested within the 15 days, but by email rather than their claim fund. By the time I received the proper procedure instructions, the time limit had expired. I lost $275. I’m hoping this post will warn others of the hidden information and use a different booking provider.

travel,Book with Expedia or Airline?,"TLDR: Expedia/Booking.com=$1480 and Air Canada=$1821. Worth it?

Hey guys, I’m planning a trip to South Korea from Vancouver, Canada from April 14 to May 12. 

Right now Air Canada is offering the round trip for $1821 and Expedia is offering the same Air Canada round trip for $1480. Booking.com is also offering $1480. 
 
I’ve seen that Expedia is kinda frowned upon in this subreddit, with people saying always book with the airline. But this fits my budget much more than the price offered by the airline. 

Is it worth it? 
Are there other options I should be considering? Honest opinions please. The dates are pretty set in stone for me and I’m fairly confident I won’t need to cancel or change the flights.

Flight would have departed at 8pm and around 1pm I went to check the tickets just to make sure there was no delays and it showed the whole round trip for us was canceled lol. I called Expedia and they told me that I called in a week ago and requested to cancel it, i explained to them I called a week ago for them to fix part of my flight which I got a email about (one leg of the return flight being canceled) and I never once said anything about canceling the whole trip. We argued back and forth when I finally remembered they record the phone conversations so I told him to listen back to the convo with the previous worker I had which they did. After 3 hours on hold they came back and apologized to me saying it was indeed the agents fault. I told them I’m going to book a new round trip right now direct through the airlines and I will only be paying what I originally paid and they will have to cover the rest which they agreed to. The original flight I was supposed to be on left Canada on time and arrived in Bali on time. The new flight that was booked was supposed to leave at 10pm. We got to the airport waiting at the gate and 10 minutes before boarding they canceled the flight because of fog 😑. We had to stay overnight at a hotel and leave the next morning. We ended up losing 2 nights of are trip in Bali which at the Airbnb I paid for were non-refundable.

Since Expedia admitted to making that huge mistake are they liable for paying for my Airbnb and overnight hotel stay, and the extra baggage fees? I’m not asking for much but compensation for expenses which wouldn’t have had to been paid if the agent never canceled are whole damn trip.

travel,Issues with Expedia,"Hey all!

So I’ve been having a great deal of troubles dealing with Expedia and Aeromexico regarding a trip we recently took to CDMX. Before anyone says that I should’ve spent more money and just booked directly with the airlines, I totally know, and now that we’ve had a plethora of issues with this, I definitely will be doing all my bookings with the airline directly in the future. 

So about a month back, my wife and I took a trip to CDMX. We booked through Expedia, with a connecting flight in Vancouver. Two weeks after we booked the flight, we received an itinerary change email from Expedia, which actually worked out better for us as it meant that we’d get to CDMX earlier. The email didn’t say anything about needing to accept the changes, and only said to contact them or the airlines if there was an issue with the change. 

Come departure day, we tried to do the online check-in and had issues, so we just arrived at the airport extra early, but were told that we wouldn’t be able to check-in due to an error in the system. We were told that Expedia never reissued the tickets and they didn’t complete the exchange in itinerary, and because of that we were unable to check-in, and thus were forced to miss our departing flight, and our connecting flight. 

In order to not cancel everything that we planned and to make best with the time off that we had to take from work for this trip, we ended up booking a same day flight which was of course super expensive.

We were able to take our original return flight home afterwards. Since then, we’ve been dealing with both Expedia and Aeromexico to try to get refund and compensation for their screwups. There’s constant deflection of blame, but it seems that the main issue is that Expedia never completed the exchange process despite sending notification to us regarding the itinerary change. 

I’ve phoned Expedia customer service about this to try to get refund, but they’ve said that they don’t issue refunds and have to contact the airline directly for that, and when they contacted Aeromexico, they were told that I was not eligible for refund due to me using the originally booked return trip. And then when I contact Aeromexico’s refunds department they tell me that they were not at fault because Expedia was the one to fail to exchange the tickets. 

So as it stands right now, we’re out of the money that we originally paid for our departing flights, as well as the money that we had to pay to get on a same day flight which was all done to prevent a complete trip cancellation.

I’m wondering if there are any other options that we may have to obtain refund and compensation? We are Canadian based and were wondering what we other options we could possibly do? I’ve already opened up a credit card dispute, and have also sent in a claim for travel insurance (under trip cancellation), but we’re wondering if there are other avenues for us to make up our losses? Thanks everyone!

travel,Good result for Expedia name correction,"I just wanted to post a positive result from Expedia because Reddit is full of bad experiences. I made a mistake and added one extra letter on my international multi-layover booking. I went to both airlines first but both carriers said they could've easily fixed it on their end if I bought directly from them, but I have to go get Expedia to fix it now. (In general, I buy direct from carriers but Asia-bound flights these days are so expensive. A good deal is  a good deal!)

My only trouble with Expedia was how long it took to get results (4 days of waiting on emails). I was fully prepared for penalties and whatnot after reading results from here, but I also realize mine is a very minor, 1 letter correction. After 4 days, they re-issued my ticket in the correct name and I didn't have to pay anything extra! There was a small hiccup of my flight saying it was ""canceled"" on the Expedia page, but customer service chat found my new ticket and my new confirmation numbers and I've now reconfirmed with the airlines. My flight is good to go again.

travel,Getting the run around from Expedia,"My husband and I are scheduled to travel to the other coast next week. We booked the hotel through Expedia - a waterfront suite at Hyatt Highlands Inn. On 12/19, I got an email saying that they couldn't accommodate us there (renovations) and proposed that we stay down the road at Carmel Valley Ranch.

Here is a summary of my contact about this reservation to this point:  


* December 20 - I called to explore alternatives  

* December 22 - I called to give the OK for Carmel Valley Ranch  

* December 26 - Since I hadn't heard anything I called back. ""It will be done tomorrow at 9am""  

* December 27 - Since I hadn't heard anything I called back and escalated to a Manager who spoke to ""Abel"" at Highlands Inn. ""It will be done tomorrow by 5pm.""  

* December 28 - Since I hadn't heard anything I called back. ""It will be done tomorrow by the end of business.""  

* December 30 - Since I hadn't heard anything I called back. ""There's not a manager on property. Call back Monday between 8am-4pm and it will be done.""  

* January 3 - Since I hadn't heard anything I called back. The reservation agent spoke to Louie ""It will be done tomorrow at 10am.""

I'm currently on hold with Expedia again. They're saying that Hyatt has to be given the chance to rebook and if Hyatt flakes out and can't accommodate us (which - holiday weekend - could happen) then Expedia will move us. I can't believe that they expect us to fly across the continent with a confirmation to a hotel that we know can't host us and just hope it all works out.

travel,Another Hotels.com/Expedia Warning,"Hi all! I recently booked my hotels for Paris and wanted to give a heads up regarding booking through [Hotels.com](https://Hotels.com), which I just learned is part of Expedia. This was my first time booking a trip out of the country, so I really didn't think to check Reddit and didn't realize there was more to look at beyond looking at hotel reviews (I wish I did!!). This is for the Olympics, so I wanted to make sure I wasn't too far from the venues. 

I tried to book the hotel online and was getting an error message, so I tried again and learned only through my credit card company that both went through, so I was double charged. I contacted [Hotels.com](https://Hotels.com) and they said there was no active booking. I told them I see on my credit card that it went through. They tell me the booking didn't go through and she suggested I call my bank to dispute. So I did, sent my credit card company the error message, explained the situation, sent the screen shot from [Hotels.com](https://Hotels.com) (also learned they don't send you the receipt of the chat, luckily I had a screen shot of the last part), and waited. 

I get a call from Expedia regarding my credit card despite, the lady was incredibly rude on the phone, tried to blame me and said I typed my email address wrong (there's no proof of this) and said I WILL be paying this because it's non-refundable. I reiterated to her that there was an error, there is a problem with their website, and she insisted there is no error. Now that I'm going through reddit, I'm seeing people having this issue even 8 years ago, so they haven't fixed this issue and it's been almost a decade! She also said she tried to email a bunch of times but the email bounced back, I asked why she didn't call sooner then if the emails weren't going through, and she didn't have an answer to that. I called my credit card company to update them and they said the dispute is still in my favor, and I sent them screenshots of the reddit posts as well. As tempting as their deals may be, I wouldn't bother booking through them, especially if it says ""non-refundable"". It seems that even if they make an error, they'll use the non-refundable policy against you.

I'm planning to book the flight through Vietnam Airline for one-way trip: Guangzhou to San Francisco (w/ a 1 stop trip to Ho Chi Minh City) and I noticed that on the official Vietnam Airline website, it says that I can only check-in 1 baggage, in addition to 1 carry-on bag and 1 personal bag, while on Expedia, it says that I can have 1 carry-on bag, and 2 free check-in bags. 

From the policy listed on the Vietnam Airline, it says that we can only have 1 carry-on, 1 personal, and 1 check-in bag from/to Vietnam, but for the trip from/to America, we can have 1 carry-on and 2 check-in bags.

I was wondering if I was to book the flight directly from Vietnam Airline, will it be okay if I check in 2 baggages and have 1 carry-on or will I need to only check-in 1 luggage since technically, the 1 stop is in Vietnam before going to America (SF)?",0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1aoo3pt/checkin_baggage_question_vietnam_airline_vs/,2024-02-12 01:23:15,Expedia

travel,Expedia Credit Issue,"Last year we booked a flight and hotel through Expedia.  We ended up having to move the flight so we canceled it.

Year later we remembered we had credits to use.  Not big travelers.  We logged into our account and the flight is not shown as canceled. We panic and call the airline who verified it was canceled but the credits are now expired.  Missed them by 2 weeks.


We talked to Expedia and they will do nothing for us. There was no alert from Expedia about expiring credits.  They said they don't provide any but that's hard to believe.  They also said the credits were in the account but cannot prove it ""because only I have access to the account."" How could the credits be placed if they never showed the flight as canceled?  

I own the fact that we should have been more on top of it, but I also believe the whole purpose of using an online travel agent should be to assist and help us manage this very type of thing.

travel,Westjet and Expedia - Change and Cancellation Fees,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I am about to make a reservation for tickets from Toronto to Cancun through Expedia, with WestJet as the airline.

&#x200B;

I was wondering if the seasoned travellers with WestJet around here could help me understand  the cancellation and changing fees. The terms and condition says: $100 per ticket for change, cancellation fees will be applied (but with no refund or credit). I have a few questions:

&#x200B;

* regarding the changing - does it apply to changing the dates only (but I'd still have to fly to same destination), or will this $100 changing fee buy me the ability to book a completely new ticket to other destinations
* If something happens and I have to cancel, since it says that there are no refunds or credit, would I be better off not showing up, instead of officially cancelling and paying the fee?
* Any other insight would be welcome!

travel,Expedia - My Bad Customer Experience,"I recently made a trip to Washington DC for a DOJ awards ceremony and used Expedia (as this was the app that pop-up during my search on googles map).  In my phone conversation with the Expedia representative (which sounded like someone from outside the U.S.) he referred me to the Hyatt House in Washington DC / The Warf. I explained that I was looking for the government rate (as I was military) he quoted me a price of $710.54 (with a $15.99 booking fee) and was told that this cost would be adjusted at the hotel once I showed proof that I was government.  As a retired Military Officer and currently working in the defense, in many of my past travels this was the case as there needs to be some proof Identification (military CAC card usually) and proceeded with the reservation.  I served in the    

Upon my checkout I provided my military ID, asked for a receipt and a breakdown of the charges.  I noticed that the charges from the bill were $499.74.  I asked if these were my charges going to my American Express and the clerk at the desk stated that this was the funds that Hyatt received from the third party. I asked if this was the adjustment for my government rate and they stated they would make any changes as they only deal with the third party (not me) for this reservation.  This raised a red flag as this did not sound like the conversation I had during the original booking.  I took a moment and quickly checked my American Express and noticed that the charge for $710.54 had not been adjusted on my account.  From what I saw it looked like Expedia had told me one thing and did another. They walked away with and extra $260.80.  I was extremely upset to say the least.  I did not have time to sit and argue with the rep behind the desk as my flight left in a couple hours and left the hotel. 

Once I arrived at home, I called the Expedia office (which I got someone in another country due to the heavy accent) an explained what I had been told at my original reservation.  He pulled up my reservation and kept mis-understanding stating that there is a motel charge $710.54 and booking fee $15.99.  I explained several times that I was a government and due the government rate and how the hotel only charged $449.74 but Expedia took an additional $260.80.  I mentioned that I had a .pdf of the receipt and could send it to him electronically showing the actual cost for two nights.  Once he understood the problem of the additional charge and the original agreement, he explained that he could not resolve the problem and would have to be send the issue to higher level to be resolve. When I asked “who took the extra money” his response was “our hotel partners” when I asked for the name of the company and telephone number his next response was “I don’t know or have this.”   

At this point I’m not sure if I will get anywhere with Expedia as they hold / took my money.  Most likely they will give me the run around, stall and make up more fabrications and excuses.  Only recourse at this point is to work with my American Express to dispute the charges.  Not sure if they can help.  I have heard of others dealing with third party booking sites and challenges.  So, in summary and lesson learned on my part and hopefully one I can pass on to others, deal directly with the hotel and not these third-party reservation sites.  Once they take your money under false pretense, they are not giving it back no matter what the original agreement may have been.

travel,Expedia Rip off,"This is insane and has represented over TEN HOURS of lost time now. I have been an expedia customer for decades, that is likely going to change now. 

The situation:  
I lost my job and had a large trip planned with flights booked. Obviously with no job I cannot afford this large trip and all that it would entail cost wise. I called your customer service line and was told that, no, I could not get my tickets refunded but that I could cancel the trip, and get a credit, to be used for one year from the original trip. I am told it must be the same passengers and same airline, ok. 

I call back a few months later when I find out my nephew is getting married in September. Suddenly, now, my credit is no longer good for a year, now it must be used within 6 months, and BOOKED within three. I battle and tell them what I was told originally, but to no avail. This is the FIRST TIME they beat me down, made me accept less than promised.  

I call back a month or so later to book for a needed short trip, now to be told that I cannot use the FULL credit, and that since I am using a credit, the price is actually over $160 MORE per ticket. No, I tell your customer service, I want the ticket price as stands, what I am using to pay for it DOES NOT MATTER. No avail. This is the SECOND TIME they beat me down, made me accept less than promised.

I call back AGAIN. at this point, I am approximately 10 HOURS into phone battles with your customer service. NOW I am told that I must book the new flight, PAY for it AGAIN, and be issued a NEW CREDIT in that amount. No way will I go through this nightmare with you AGAIN to use a new credit. This is the THIRD TIME they tried to beat me down, and make me accept less than promised. 

As it stands I am only asking to use maybe $900 of a $2500 credit. 

All this, being told to me by customer service agents that are incredibly difficult to understand because English is not their first language. 

I will NEVER book with Expedia again.

Edited to add: ONE hour and 20 min into this most recent call, they tell me that I cannot use the credit after all, and that YES they see in the notes I am approved to use it for this flight, but that those previous agents were WRONG and they are ""very sorry"".

My mother and I booked a one way flight through Expedia (my Expedia account with mom's credit card) for my younger brother at the end of October. Yes, I'm aware that third parties like Expedia usually favor no one but themselves and have a tendency to make things unusually difficult with the slightest of hiccups. Against my better judgment, though, I solidified the American Airlines ticket for him through Expedia. Unfortunately, we ended up needing to cancel my brother's ticket because he was arrested prior to us picking him up and leaving for the airport.

Expedia provided a flight credit covering the full cost of the ticket we canceled to be used prior to October 2024. Great, EXCEPT due to his arrest, my brother cannot leave the state until December of 2024. I've combed through Reddit, Googled, and waited on hold for a couple of hours with Expedia being passed around and subsequently disconnected. From what I understand, the Expedia flight credit must be utilized by the passenger listed on the original plane ticket. I also read about purchasing an extremely cheap ticket with said flight credit, canceling, and possibly ending up with the remainder being a ""trip credit."" Other travelers even mentioned success in calling/pleading their own personal cases of extenuating circumstances to AA. I recall seeing something about disputing the credit card charges, too.

travel,Question about Expedia,"On Saturday night Aug 19, I booked flights for myself and my travel companions via Expedia. I received Expedia’s confirmation email, but the email says “ticketing in progress. The airline will confirm most tickets within 5 minutes, but some ticket types take up to 24 hours.”

I checked this morning and still never received an actual booking confirmation, so I called the airline. They don’t have my booking and they keep referring me to Expedia while Expedia keeps referring me back to the airline. 

Anyway, I plan to rebook directly with the airline and pay a little more, but I’m afraid of being double charged (I have not gotten charged on my card yet).

Except that I did when I immediately realized that I had booked the flights on the wrong dates. I noticed the error in the booking, cancelled my tickets and rebooked for the correct dates. 

The only problem was that the website kept glitching, I would cancel, and it would immediately go to a white screen with no confirmation. I cancelled again a few times and then tried once more on the app. 

When I didn't see a refund a few days later, I contacted the company, mentioned the duplicate booking (with the same itinerary) and told them that I think I encountered a glitch. My mistake was not calling to confirm as soon as I didn't get a confirmation. At this point, Expedia told me the best that they could do was a flight credit for the same itinerary (which I did not need or want) and that a refund was not possible. When I mentioned the glitch, the customer service agent told me that she would ""go back"" and look at my actions on the screen to see what I did and did not do. Conveniently, she never saw any of my attempts to cancel and concluded that I never tried to do so, even though I did have the wherewithal to rebook my flights for the correct dates.

travel,Expedia cancelled our reservation and won't offer a refund - is there anything I can do to get my reservation back?,"Hello,

So my girlfriend and I booked a hotel with expedia. We realized we had booked it for the wrong weekend initially (like within 5 minutes of making the booking), but unfortunately we were dumb and got the non-refundable option. We put in a request to have the date changed, but eventually decided we could just go that weekend and it'd be fine. Using the virtual agent on their website we attempted to cancel the request to have the date changed, but instead it just instantly cancelled our booking as a whole - no ""are you sure?"" or confirmation, just instantly cancelled. We then called expedia to explain the situation, and told them we just wanted our reservation uncancelled as we didn't mean for it to be cancelled in the first place. They said they'd submit a request to their manager or something to try to get the case resolved, but they just ended up emailing us saying that we weren't eligible for a refund. We just want our reservation back - is there anything we can do? Or should I just charge them back on my card and book something else?

I combed my email, checked my trips on Expedia, scoured my credit card for charges: nothing. I googled hotels in the city in question and a clicked link showed in the results. I messaged the hotel to see if they had the reservation. They did. And it shows in their Expedia system. I called Expedia giving the number the hotel gave me as a trip number. They told me there is no reservation and that’s not their format for numbers. 

Reassured by the hotel, I cancelled the second reservation I’d made in my panic. When I arrived at the hotel in question, they checked me in and told me the reservation was prepaid. If I hadn’t seen the clicked link and messaged them, I’d have been a no-show, and paid somewhere else in addition!

I currently have a booking via Expedia (Delta) for LHR - LAX (2 Adults and 1 Lap Infant). Annoyingly for whatever reason, expedia cannot make a change to change the lap infant to an infant in seat. Its against policy? Unsure why but ok. Either way, we're in a position now where 8 months on from when we booked, a lap infant really isnt ideal so we want to pay extra for the change.

Expedia said we can have a credit but you then have to book the same? (So they said) so there is no real benefit. We could also part credit the booking, but again unsure on the benefit.

Has anyone got experience with making this type of change and using expedia credits? Is there a way we can make this work and pay the extra for infant seat instead.

travel,Need advice w/ Expedia situation,"We got tickets to Europe from Expedia. I usually get tickets direct from the airlines via Google Flights, but this time around, Expedia had cheaper tickets (probably considering the trip is during Christmas $$$). Our outbound flights were operated by Delta - one clearly said “Delta”  and the other one said “Virgin Atlantic, operated by DELTA AIR LINES.” 

Fast forward to today, our outbound flight got updated by Delta and now we had an 8+ hour layover. As I figured, Delta was no help and referred us to Expedia. I found a Delta operated outbound flight plan that minimized our layover and asked the Expedia agent to change our outbound flights to the new ones I found. The Expedia agent was great and made it happen. Now our layover is acceptable.

An hour later, we’re getting inundated by calls from the Expedia agent saying that there was a mistake and since our original flight from our layover stop to Europe was Virgin Atlantic, the new flight has to be operated by Virgin Atlantic. But there are no other flights by Virgin to our destination other than the original one. And technically, the Virgin flight was operated by Delta. I told them I’d talk to them later since I was busy at the moment.

My question is should I even bother answering their calls and risk getting thrown back on the original flight plan with an 8+ hour layover (on top of the long transatlantic flight)? Or should I ignore their calls since this was their mistake and from my end, everything looks good to go (both on the Expedia portal and the Delta portal)?",1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/164ylq0/need_advice_w_expedia_situation/,2023-08-29 23:47:12,Expedia

travel,HUGE Expedia Mistake! Will they make it right??? #expedia #travel #expedia-disaster #expedia-system-failure,"On March 24, 2023 I booked with Expedia - where I have been a long time customer with complete profiles on myself and travelers in my family for many years - and paid over $11k for 2 (including myself) travelers to fly from Austin, TX to Florence, Italy June 10-19, 2023. 
The booking came with airline confirmation numbers and showed these last 2 months in my “upcoming trips” list in Expedia. I have a paid receipt from Expedia. I have the booking populated to my calendar. 

This morning I put in the airline locator and my full itinerary popped right up with the option to check in. Check in would not complete. I wanted to recall my seat numbers and get my boarding pass electronically so I called the airline to find out why I could not complete check in for my early morning flight the next day. 

The airline said Expedia had not sent the ticket numbers and I should call them. 
FOUR HOURS on hold and intermittently talking with Expedia customer service revealed some “data failed to transfer” in their system and that “the system should not have completed my payment” as there is no ticketing - regardless of my airline locators telling me the plane is on time and I’m expected. 

So … they asked would I like to go online and find another option to get to Florence the next morning?  I did this with the rep on the phone. My original itinerary was business class on domestic flights and first class on international flights. I found the next most identical option to match my itinerary and seat level. It’s $20k more than I originally paid. I was told they had to submit a ticket to get me to a different “back office” department that would call me “today” to resolve the issue since they could not approve the money “at their level”. 

4 hours later and 14 hours from flight time I am still awaiting the call. I tried calling them after 2.5 hours and spent 35 minutes on hold to learn they could not transfer me and I have to wait to receive a call. 

I hope Expedia makes this right. I had no red flags that Expedia dropped the ball on me over the last 10 weeks since I bought and completed this booking.

Over the last 8ish years I've flown a lot and also been in charge of all my mom's travel as well. I've flown delta, American, United, spirit, frontier, Lufthansa, Alaska, Swiss, Air France, and British airways multiple times. I've primarily booked via Expedia or directly through the airline's website, all times of the year and in and out of multiple airports. Up until 2021 we rarely had any issues, and when there were issues they were resolved quickly and painlessly. August 2021 was the beginning of many miserable flights for both of us. Every time I've flown I've dealt with multiple delays and cancellations (only once due to weather), lost bags, disappearing reservations, and losing paid upgrades at the gate with no refunds. My most recent experience was the worst of all, to the point where I honestly don't want to fly again and it got me thinking has it always been this bad or did Covid ruin air travel? Was I just lucky for the first few years or am I unlucky now? Did I get put on some sort of secret most hated customer list? Has someone cursed me? Lol

travel,Expedia cancels pre-paid hotel reservation.,"Hey experts 

I've recently had my pre-paid hotel reservation (Rome) cancled by expedia. When I enquired with both the hotel and expedia they've pointed at each other as the party for the cancellation. 

The stay has been now been confirmed and paid at original local price. However the booking was done prior with exchange rate. The difference between prepaid and the pay at stay difference is around 500AUD. Quite significant.  

So far I have statement from the hotel that the cancellation was issued by expedia. And three emails 

1. Hotel xxxxx sent message ""reservation is cancelled at customer request""
2. Do you wish to cancel the reservation 
3. Reservation cancellation confirmed 

All at the same minute. 

Any chance on having expedia to cough up the difference or be compensated?

travel,The Nightmare of Expedia (DO NOT BOOK WITH EXPEDIA),"This is a bit of a longer story and I'll try not to rant on too much.

My friends and I wanted to travel as a group. We are all from Canada and some are first-time travellers. Luckily two of us are well versed enough to organize and plan the whole thing. Normally purchasing directly with an airline or a travel agent is more reliable but this time we went with Expedia and oh boy was that a mistake.

The trip was supposed to be in May of 2020 and we quickly realized that we would have to cancel the trip. We tried emails & phone calls since December 2019 and it took till September 2020 to finally reach someone about the trip. We were offered a credit, as refunds were not being issued at that time. 

Fast forward to 2021 and we were told this credit had an expiry date despite earlier phone calls and emails stating otherwise. So we contact them and after a few hours of phone calls, a voucher was given to us for Air Canada that doesn't expire. Now, this voucher did not include the 200$ we each paid in insurance for our trip. We didn't bother arguing further as we had already been through enough and we figured this was due to COVID. We would have left things here...

Yesterday that we received an email from Expedia about our credit expiring, and another one this morning. I figured it was a mistake but with what I had experienced so far, I needed to be sure. So I get on the phone for about 3 hours of hold time to finally speak to someone about this. As it turns out they forgot to mark our trips as cancelled and that we already had a credit. The email was a mistake. 

While on hold I decided to look at the policy once again for the protection plan. We had read it before buying to see what we were covered for and I discover that they added a section for COVID19 that states we cant get a refund. We bought our tickets about 6 months before COVID19 was even in any mainstream media. So it's at this point that I decided: ""since I'm calling, I should bring this up""

I address this in the call and to no surprise, they tell me that ""I should have read the policy before purchasing.""  We definitely did. The operator was continuously gaslighting me and after telling him I wasn't going to stop until this was sorted.  He sends a ticket off for their support team to deal with it further and he hangs up. About 10 minutes later we get an email saying our claim does not constitute a refund because of the policy which they added after we purchased. 

Let this be a lesson, take pictures or print out policies shortly after you purchase so you can prove your statements. 

AND NEVER USE EXPEDIA they are crooks and thieves.

&#x200B;

TL;DR 

* We booked with Expedia.
* They changed their phone system to make it impossible to speak to someone until after your trip was supposed to take place.
* Almost a year after the trip was supposed to happen we got a partial refund.
* They scammed us out of 200$ each for a protection plan because they changed their policy to prevent refunds for COVID19 (which didn't exist at the time of purchase)",2,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/sywiya/the_nightmare_of_expedia_do_not_book_with_expedia/,2022-02-22 19:49:13,Expedia

I booked rooms somewhere else. I refuse to book with Expedia again. I asked her if I booked a reservation how can the price change just because the hotel room rates when up?

travel,Expedia-Flight with Redeemed Credit More Expensive?,"Hello everyone,

My question is: Is booking a flight with credit more expensive than just booking a normal flight? Cause that is what Expedia just did.

Background: I booked a domestic US trip last year that I had to cancel-not at the last minute, and got delta airline credit in return (first mistake I know).  So now I booked a flight using that credit ($337) and had to pay an additional $40 for that ticket.  But I also had to get a ticket for an additional person and the ticket price was about $80 less.  I checked Expedia prices and the price was also lower than the $377 I had to pay for my redeemed ticket.  

The person I chatted with said (copied and pasted-can't load a picture at the moment): 

""Here is the thing. Airlines offer different rates and availabilities for new booking and for flight credit redemption. That's why there are different rates when you look at the booking on the website as a new booking compare on the rates when you are redeeming a credit.""

travel,Expedia tries to charge you 100 dollars per flight to redeem flight credits.,"
Story time, I booked a trip for my gf and I 6 months ago. Had to cancel because I had covid. Bought all the insurance etc. got my refund no problem through the insurance no problem and flight credits through Expedia for jet blue and United ( didn’t know you you had to book through Expedia again when you get flight credits and you have to call to do so). 6 months later I’m booking  another vacation. 2 flights through jet blue and 2 flights through United. For me I have 147.10 jet blue and 98.10. And my gf the same thing so a total of 4  different flight credits worth about 493 . Calling to book through Expedia they say “ per the airlines we have to charge you 100 dollar fee per credit/ flight to use” 

WOAH so you’re telling me I’m losing 400 dollars worth of credits because off fees ?.what type of bullshit is that.  So I go back and forth with the lady she keeps giving the run around and tries to deny me  on Anything she can do . After the 4th time of asking for a supervisor she puts me on hold and says this one time she can wave the fees. Okay cool. Jet blue flight gets booked. ( charging me full price then a credit back on my credit card) in 7-10 days. Time for United……. She says Per policy since the flight canceled was a domestic flight I can’t use it for a flight the starts Internationally….. HUH??. Okay i hold off on booking and call United to verify. Not true of course. 

So I call Expedia back and I get a different lady… well the First Lady didn’t put in the notes that she was voiding all four fees only two. So after going back and fourth with the Second Lady had to force her to escalate my call. Because she’s acting like it’s nothing she can do. Finally get a supervisor/ escalations team member he goes back and listen to the call and finally books my return flight. same ordeal booking at full price and crediting my card in 7-10 days. In total all calls took about 3 hours.

I usually don’t book my flights through Expedia but sometimes their package deals you can’t beat. If this happens to you they can wave that 100 dollar fee the first time. it’s not stated ANYWHERE. You’ll will have to fight for it though lol. I’m like what the point of getting insurance if you’re going to charge me 100 dollars to re use the credit

travel,"Is ""booking directly with the hotel"" a very US or European thing to do or prefer?","EDIT : Not sure why the question is getting downvoted. I am asking this question purely to understand more about how our travel choices are different and if there is a cultural angle to it.

Asking this question as an Indian who is used to booking via some 3rd party and rarely directly. I travel quite a bit internationally for leisure trips and have always used [Bookin.com](http://Bookin.com), Airbnb, Agoda etc for finding and booking all accommodations on my trips. The only exceptions being when either I needed to reach out to hotel directly for some info and book with them directly coz I am on call anyway or it is a very last minute booking (let's say trying to book a room at 7pm for the night or next 2) and calling a hotel will get me a better deal coz they have spare inventory but the online or their own website's prices don't update as dynamically, so calling got me 15-20% cheaper deals. Most of my friends have very similar experiences. Flights I have always found cheaper rates with aggregators than direct airlines, even my credit card points can be used with these aggregators (example HDFC with cleartrip, goibibo etc.) unlike that in US, where I understand the banks tie-up with airlines or hotels directly.

What surprised me a lot on this sub is the no. of posts and people supporting direct booking with hotels and flights - even if the prices are may be higher by \~5-10%. I understand from the threads that you all have had few bad experiences with Expedia or [booking.com](http://booking.com) for refunds or reschedules or unexpected changes, but don't the platforms also give a lot of protection in terms of cancellation policies, reducing payment issues, getting your money back if the hotel cancels etc? These things are fairly important for me, especially if it's not a hotel chain, to consider directly booking with the hotel well in advance and paying them upfront. Do you folks not worry about these standard policies or do the hotels offer such policies anyway? I would love to book directly with hotels to put more money in their pockets but have never been able to get around these questions. Do you folks in general believe in dealing directly with business owners than with middle men, like prefer buying from a company website over Amazon etc. or this is a very specific travel related perspective because of the policies/ customer care of [booking.com](http://booking.com) or others?",78,256,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1dpoaa3/is_booking_directly_with_the_hotel_a_very_us_or/,2024-06-27 10:46:12,Expedia

travel,Question with Expedia. Maybe mistake hotel fare.,"Maybe someone here can help me give me some guidance.

A few weeks ago I found a very good hotel fare (in a beach in Mexico). I was surprised because the hotel is fancy, and fares are often in the 500 per night (all inclusive). The fare I found was in the 250ish.  But the fare on Expedia looked strange. I tried to book it, and it would just say ""sorry the room and fare is no longer available"". I was bummed, but that's fair, whatever, anyways, I refreshed the page and the fare appeared again. Long story short, it eventually allowed me to book a room at that special fare.  I basically got a 50% discount. 

My question is, if it is indeed a mistake fare, what would happen. At this point the rooms at the same resort are at 1000 per night. I am just afraid that i will show up and they would say, oh we don't have your reservation, Expedia made a mistake, Adios Amigo. 

How likely is that? Not that it matters, but i do have gold status with Expedia (for about four years now) and they have always been quite helpful and i have received excellent customer service. And i do have a confirmation number, and my credit card has been charged. The only issue is that the description of the room is  vague. (Not a huge issue, as all rooms seem to be excellent).

I haven't wanted to call the hotel and confirm my reservation, in case they say oh, we have it here but it's clearly a mistake. Or that they would say, oh, we will add these fees. I also haven't called Expedia, since they gave me a confirmation number.

Were all 18 and dumb, and when I went to enter in everyone's names on expedia as I was booking our tickets, I misspelled Yiannis to Yiannia.   


I called expedia and after a while was told that finnair would not just do a name change because its a multiple airlines flight, and that I would need to pay a fee of $25, and for a new ticket (after which they would refund the original). Okay no big deal right? wrong. The new ticket is now $2,500, when the original price we paid is $1030. I've argued and done all I could with expedia to try and get this lowered, considering its a single letter in a name.  


I've seen a lot online that its kind of unspoken that small misspellings are very rarely if ever an issue, but as this is our first time flying (for two of us) and we have many stops on both our departing flight and our returning flight, we cant help but be worried about getting denied boarding in a foreign country without any real adults with us.

Can't wait that long, so I call booking support. Answering machine tells to enter reservation number. After entering it just keeps repeating and asking for reservation number. Tried several times. After googling found out reservation number is probably too long and the machine glitches out. Can't reach booking support via phone. I tell once again the host we do not want to cancel and if there is anything we can do to keep our reservation. It's not been canceled by host and booking shows if we cancel there is a cancellation fee. Sure host says we can cancel for free but we don't want that. Hosts ignores. We search for new accomodation and book one for the next days. After staying in the new apartment 36 hours later, during the night, 1 am I have received a call from booking singapore. Was sleeping, didn't hear the call. I'd imagine they know where I am due to the reservations (Bulgaria) so it's a weird call time. Late afternoon I get a message from booking they have canceled the reservation and they wish I've found a new place to stay. After that I've sent them messages if I could leave a review for the accomodation and if there are any compensation etc. but they don't respond anything anymore.

So all in all, booking accomodations from smaller hosts via booking is a bit risky and will avoid it in the future. There is basically no penalty for the host for cancelling reservations as they want. There is no way knowing if that is a common thing the host does. At least in airbnb there is an automated review saying the host canceled the reservation. Booking support is absolutely horrible and had not known it is that bad. After reading all reviews from the accomodation there is one saying the host changed their accomodation to another apartment, so it leaves me wondering if cancelling reservations is common for this property since booking doesn't punish in any way. 

Some days later I make an invoice for the property for the late cancellation and time spent looking for the new apartment. I don't expect to be paid but it's for a reminder they have done wrong. Send jt to booking and the host. Don't get any response anymore from anyone, no wonder though.

Wanted to share our experience. What makes it even worse is that we were hiking on mountains the day before check-in and did not really have time to look for a new place to stay. For us, we definitely will prefer airbnb from now on. Thanks for reading. ",262,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fck3gz/host_cancels_one_day_before_checkin/,2024-09-09 07:54:51,Expedia
travel,Why are you booking flights with 3rd party websites?,"This is a genuine question.

I have a very good friend who continues to do this, despite all the horror stories on here. He will use flight comparison sites and then book the lowest cost flight through some non-UK website I’ve never heard of, just so he can save less than £100 on the price.

**Edit**: To give an example of the extremities I’m talking about - my friend flew from the UK to Italy. He used a comparison website he found through a Google search which then took him to a Hungarian website to book the tickets (which his browser translated into English). This just seems risky to me, especially the potential mistakes in the translation causing you to enter incorrect information. The website even allowed him to purchase extra legroom seats but when he went to check in they were all taken.

Those of you who still book flights through Expedia and the likes, why? Do you really want to save a small percentage of the price and just hope everything goes smoothly?

If it all goes wrong, the airline won’t deal with you. The contract will be between them and the booking agent (Expedia, etc.). Cue the horror stories you see on here about 3rd parties refusing to refund or arrange rebooking.

I’m curious to hear everyone’s reasons!

**Edit:** I’m not suggesting £100 is pocket change. My point is, saving £100 but having a non-exchangeable, non-refundable ticket doesn’t seem worth it to me. If you need to take a different flight because something comes up or can’t take the trip, you’ve either lost all your money or you’re paying more than the different for an entirely new ticket.",314,202,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18ebd5d/why_are_you_booking_flights_with_3rd_party/,2023-12-09 11:08:15,Expedia
travel,Expedia not refunding Qantas tickets from April 2020,"We purchased Qantas tickets from San Francisco to Sydney and back from Brisbane to San Francisco for April 2020. Unfortunately, they were cancelled due to the pandemic. However, over and over again Expedia refuses to refund the money from the flights. We paid almost $3000 for 3 people but they’re only giving an “airline credit” that can ONLY be used on Qantas flights that originate from the United States. I’ve chatted and called them and none have been successful. They tell us to contact Qantas but Qantas isn’t able to do anything since Expedia is the one giving the credits. Qantas actually refunded people that had booked on their website and got the flights cancelled. Expedia says “Qantas doesn’t allow us to give a refund!”

Currently, there are no flights from SFO to SYD (which don’t resume until July) nor Melbourne or Brisbane. Additionally, looking at the ticket prices it seems that the prices for when the flights do resume from SFO, they are insanely expensive. It’s like $2,500 per person for late summer, Thanksgiving, or Christmas. Even if I drove to LA and flew from there, it’s still over $1,500 per person. We could fly to Fiji from SFO then use Qantas credits, but they ONLY apply for use with a departure from the US. It blows my mind how they’re allowed to give such restrictive credits that are so hard to be used. It expires in 2023 December, but who knows if/when tue prices will come down.

Oh and I asked them if I’m able to use it on a Jetstar flight from Hawaii and find a cheap ticket to Hawaii (and stay a few days), they said they can’t because it’s a “different airline” even though it’s a wholly owned subsidiary of Qantas.


Is there any way to get a refund? I’ve been contacting them since April 2020 but they won’t issue a refund.",0,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/srdgvl/expedia_not_refunding_qantas_tickets_from_april/,2022-02-13 07:53:33,Expedia

travel,Middle name transformed to initials by Expedia,"Hi, I need some help to understand my situation. 

I booked a flight through Expedia. When I checked the airlines associated name (not the ticket per say), I discovered that my middle names has converted to initials. This is not how it is written on my passport.  I contacted Expedia many times by they are very reluctant to respond back to my request.

On the other hand, the airlines said that if you need to change your name an re-issue a ticket, you will need to pay a fee. However, they have also said, ""We have authorized your name change"". What does this mean?  They are not clear-cut beyond that!

I think as the name is long,  the name on the ticket is going to be trimmed anyway, but I am worried if the airline's agent might not issue me a boarding ticket because of that. What do you recommend?

Onto my issue…I purchased 3 tickets on 01/30 and the charge for all 3 showed up as pending in my account, as expected. Today, it’s only showing pending for the amount of one ticket. I chatted with Expedia customer service and they say my tickets are paid for and confirmed, and sent an email detailing that to be true. I also checked the airline website, and they have our tickets confirmed (with ticket numbers). 

My question is- since Expedia does in fact have our flights booked, should I expect that they’re going to charge me (officially) for the other two tickets? I very much doubt that I lucked out and got 3 for the price of 1, but the money sitting in my account when it should be gone is making me itchy.",1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/10qzqmn/expedia_weird_things_with_charges/,2023-02-01 17:00:51,Expedia

travel,Expedia charge,I am going on a trip 07/21 I booked thru expedia. I have used expedia for years and never had a porblem with them. I use them since they give me points on future stays. I booked flight and hotel for total of $2454. I was charged on Firday the day I did a booking for $750. I had a busy weekend. Today Monday is when I noticed it. So I logged into expedia and it is now showing that for my flight and my hotel rate was $931.58 and that the charge was $750 remainder to pay at hotel. So I messaged expedia no answer on the phone. Since I am at work I am unable to wait 2+ hrs for them to answer. So I used the chat. The lady told me that I do show a booking for the hotel and the flight. The $931 was for the hotel and $1700 for the flights. It is 4 people and I booked flights thru expedia since rate as package was $150 lower per person. So I have checked with airline app and it shows my tickets and lets me choose seats. I also contacted my bank and says I have a pending charge for $1700 but it can show pending for 3days and merchant basically has whenever they want to charge to charge. Expedias solution was to cancel my flights and re book them to make sure it goes thru. My only problem is that the current flight no longer has seats and the other flights are $100 more than the one I booked. We are doing a group trip and have 8 other people on this flight and would love to stay together. I have been booking flights for our entire party and did not have the issue with anyone else only mine. The expedia lady did let me know I am still in a cancelation window once it closes I would be under airlines guidelines of no cancelling or anything. I am not sure if I should wait it out and see if transaction clears and be good. Or should I cancel and re book that's a additional $400. and not be with our party.

travel,Expedia Travel Issue. Options?,"I booked a round trip itinerary with Expedia from San Diego to Anchorage back in Nov 2022 for a trip in Feb 2023. Delta was used SAN to ANC and Alaskan Airlines for ANC to SAN.

On the day of the trip, Delta notifies me that my SAN to Seattle flight has been cancelled due to mechanical issues. Expedia confirms the cancellation via text. After many calls/visit to the airport, Delta says they will issue a trip refund (no confirmation email, just told verbally by gate agent). I asked about alternate flights and Delta provided no options. I also asked about options with Alaskan Airlines since they are partners, and was given the same answer. I even spoke directly to an Alaska agent who said there were no options. I was very disappointed, but it seemed like there were no other solutions.

Since then, I have received a refund from Delta as promised (SAN to ANC) but nothing for my return flight. I called Expedia but they say my return tickets appears as a “No Show” with Alaskan Airlines and I should just file a claim since I bought the trip protection plan. I explain that Delta cancelled the first flight and I never left San Diego. Expedia nor the airline was able to provide any alternative other than cancellation. I call Alaskan Airlines to confirm and they say  I am also a “No Show” in their system - no refund will be issued and this is Expedia’s problem. I have since filed a claim with the travel insurance plan, but I have low expectations.

I am not sure what I can do, assuming the claim falls through. The return tickets amount to $500+, so it’s not an insignificant amount. This was my first time using Expedia and I obviously won’t be using it again… but I feel like this entire situation was out of my control. I probably should have reached out to Expedia and Alaskan right after Delta’s cancellation, since I made the wrong assumption that the entire trip was cancelled… but this was not on my mind in the moment. 

I am frustrated my entire vacation was cancelled on the day of and now no one will refund the majority of my trip, especially since all parties say I’m apparently at fault.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11l3owm/expedia_travel_issue_options/,2023-03-07 16:21:25,Expedia
travel,Trying to use airline credit on Expedia.,"Had to cancel a trip to Hawaii in 2021. Received credit back on Expedia, where I orignally booked. Now when I try to use the credit, with the same airline, Expedia is telling me that the extra charges I have to pay are because I am using the credit to go to a different destination,  and the airline is charging extra taxes because of the change.  The online extra price was $90, but you cannot use credits online, you have to tallk to an agent. Got connected, and after a long wait the chat agent told me the extra charge would be $145 extra.  No explanation as to why the charge was different from the online version of my attempted booking.  So I call the phone number to speak to a live agent. Again after more than a half hour of back and forth, him looking at what I was trying to book, he came back and told me the extra charges now would be $300.  He said the prices and availablity change by the minute, so the base price changes as the day progesses, and I was warned that if I came back a day later and tried to book, the price would be highter again.  I checked later, for the same flights and same route and airline and the price was what I had seen originally.  No explanation from the agent as to how I could use my credit, just said I would have to pay.

Which is fine because that is usually standard I believe.  Something came up and I ended up canceling on June 28 which was still in the free cancelation window.  I figured I'd get the $199 back.

travel,Expedia Scam - advice needed,"Went to Budapest for the F1 Grand Prix a month ago, booked an apartment through Expedia. 

Upon arriving at the apartment, it became obvious that the listing was either fake, or that the owner had double booked and forgot about our booking. We arrived, realised the check in information was missing some key info, and when we called the number for the owner they had no idea who we were and claimed they do not use Expedia. They had very poor English so it was difficult to communicate, but what we could gather is they used Expedia in the past, but don't anymore. Either this was a fake duplicate listing, or the original listing that the owner neglected to remember our booking. 

Either way, we had to scramble to find new accommodation through Airbnb and luckily we got some considering how busy Budapest was that weekend.

We called Expedia twice from Budapest to get a refund, and both times we were on hold for +20 mins before they dropped the call (this resulted in a €70 pointless phone bill). 

When we got home we contacted Expedia again and they have since transferred our case to the ""relevent department"", and we have received very little info as to the status of the case since then. It has now been almost 4 weeks.

travel,Please avoid Booking.com at all costs.,"I know my story is not the worst, but I just spent an hour twenty on the phone with their customer service repeatedly telling me that they have no responsibility at all and putting me on long long holds, and I promised them I would try to publicize their shittiness however I could so here I am.

So we booked a place to stay one night, booking.com sends a “confirmed”. Get to the place late night and we are emailed another 3rd party app by the owner requesting we upload everyone’s passports. This wasn’t clearly requested on the listing but sure in principle it’s reasonable. The issue is this random 3rd party app doesn’t work on our phones, and though we repeatedly try uploading our passports (and it’s sketchy as hell because it’s some unknown app) we keep getting “denied”. They refuse a refund.

After about an hour waiting outside I book another place directly for a steep rate cuz it’s late, submit a ticket on the app for a listing. A week later still no response I call booking, multiple times and over the aforementioned long call, they repeatedly say there is nothing they can do and it is our fault. 

So essentially I pay $150 bucks, show up somewhere and then they the decide to add in a requirement I cannot meet, and there is no refund. For all I know the listing is a total fraud, it doesn’t exist, and the “app” requesting our passports simple is designed not to work. Booking.com told me repeatedly it is my responsibility to detect fraud even though they host this persons listings on their site. They provide absolutely no guarantee that what you are booking isn’t just outright fraud, I asked them if it were hypothetically just fake listings being posted and they essentially said there is nothing they would do in that case, they don’t care one bit.

travel,I'll never use booking.com ever again - and you should not either,"Just a rant - sorry. We booked a hotel for the total solar eclipse way ahead of time (December 17th). The hotel called me a month before the eclipse (outside of [booking.com](http://booking.com) communication channels) and requested that I approve a date change (because they just realized they are overbooked). Obviously to a date outside the eclipse. I declined.  
They send me an email through the [booking.com](http://booking.com) system with a one-click ""please confirm if you’d like to cancel this booking"" link, followed immediately with a ""YOUR ROOM RESERVATION HAS BEEN CANCELLED"".

I called the hotel to complain and they told me to contact [booking.com](http://booking.com) - the hotel claimed it's the mistake of [booking.com](http://booking.com) because they advertised a wrong rate.

So I contacted [booking.com](http://booking.com) - and I was not prepared for how terrible their customer support is.

It took me hours on the phone, multiple managers and superviors, emails and call backs to finally reach someone who was ""allowed"" to make a decision on the case. I was told on the phone that I can book a new hotel of the same class, and [booking.com](http://booking.com) will refund the difference in price. Just a month out from the solar eclipse, any other hotel was obviously way more expensive now - over $300 more expensive to be exact. This was communicated to [booking.com](http://booking.com) multiple times. And this was acknoledge by [booking.com](http://booking.com) multiple times on the phone.

Because of the messy experience over the few days with their customer support, I requested the resolution in writing. I was told I will receive an email confirmation and we ended the call. Again, I was not prepared for how terrible their customer support is. The email I received stated:

>!We are happy to see that your trip is back on track!  We can work on a refund for the price difference of your stay, up to a maximum of 25 EUR.!<

I called them again, for the 20th time (not exaggurating) - and I still feel bad for the poor representative that day. It ended up being a 3 hour call of ""No call backs. No more bullshitting. Get whomever you need on the phone to sort this shit out now."" ... which actually worked, which is the saddest part of the story. I don't want to be rough and rude to people to arrive at a resolution. The result was an email stating:

>!We can work on a refund for the price difference of your stay, up to a maximum of 361.69 USD. All you need to do is send us the invoice for your alternative accommodation.!<

So I did. 4 weeks ago, just a week after the eclipse, I forwarded the $333.50 invoce via a response to the email I received from [booking.com](http://booking.com), which had a custom support sender address linked to my account, booking reference in the subject, everything. I gave them a May 1st due date to process the refund. And waited. To no avail. No response. No refund.

So I called them. And again I was unprepared for how shitty they are.

Call 1: They (pretended to?) be unable to hear me and hung up.

Call 2: Friendly, to the point, understood the issue, claimed they never received anything, gave me a new email address to send documents to. I did, they acknoledged that my email was received, I asked for a one-liner in response to confirm in writing that the email was received. ""absolutely, give me just a minute"" was followed by 30 minutes of silence and the call got disconnected. No email was received.

Call 3: They (pretended to?) be unable to understand what my issue was, claimed they have to get in contact with the refunds department, I was placed on hold music mid sentence, and the call was disconnected 20 minutes later.

Call 4: Friendly, request for a supervisor was declined because she wanted to try and help me first, took a bit more time to make them understand the issue, but in the end she said she will be able to send me an email confirmation and asked if she can put me on hold - I declined, because I was hung up on two times tonight while being on hold. So I listened to her typing for 20 minutes. She told me that she sent the email to me and wanted to disconnect the call. I asked her to wait on the line until I actually receive the email, and her immediate response was: >!oh, sorry, I sent it to the wrong email address, my mistake.!<

She corrected her mistake(?) and I received the email saying ""We received your latest email regarding the documents for the refund.""

travel,Booking.com just cost me 2000€,"I had booked a ticket to India back and forth for around 2000€. It was scheduled for this Saturday. Due to a medical issue that came about I was unable to travel. I booked a flexible ticket with booking.com so my plan was to reschedule. 

I called the customer service which connected me to a call centre in India called GO to Gate. He said that I can reschedule but then my journey should be within September 1 of next year since that's when I purchased my ticket. I asked him if there are any alternatives because flying this Saturday wouldn't be the best. He said I can get a refund for the ticket. I was surprised. He then spent 5 minutes CONVINCING me that I indeed have a refund. He was very extremely condescending. Finally I gave in and cancelled as he said minimum I'll get 1200€ back. 

I called Lufthansa to confirm. They said my ticket was not refundable. I called GoToGate back and told them this and they assured me that is not theme case and that Lufthansa was wrong. I told them was panicking even more. Finally I get a mail stating that ""as you requested for cancellation we have cancelled. You've been advised that your ticket will not be refundable so we will not refund the ticket"". What a bunch of lies!!!!! Now despite having booked a flexible ticket for times like this I have no flight and all the money is down the drain. 

But despite having a written confirmation from the guy who convinced me they're not taking any action. I cancelled on their advice!!!!! I would not have done it otherwise. But they take NO accountability. As a customer you're just screwed out of your money. There's no way to contact their higher ups. You will just get a different agent every time and all you can do is rant and all they say is that they can't do anything. I'm beyond livid. 

I have booked in booking.com before but this is the first time I had to use their customer support. Be warned that if it's going to them then your money is as good as gone. Not only that you cannot rely on their advice because they take no accountability if what THEY SAID goes wrong. You'll get an insincere apology and empty pockets.

travel,Unpopular opinion: booking.com is great,"Hey guys,

I have read so many negative posts and comments on [booking.com](http://booking.com) on here that today, after a really great experience with them, I wanted to share a different view. (And just before anyone asks: NO, I am not a bot, I do not work for them, I do not have anything to gain from them by posting this.)

For background: my partner and I have been using [booking.com](http://booking.com) exclusively for the past two+ years (approx 30  hotel reservations in that time). Thanks to that, we have 'genius level 3' which affords us with discounts as well as 'priority assistance' by support.

Today we had to contact them via phone regarding two issues (no wait time on hotline):  
  
1) for a booking that we made and  cancelled within the cancellation period. Despite us receiving a cancellation confirmation via eMail, the full price was deducted from our credit card.   
Solution: while on the phone with us, the support agent called the safari lodge in South Africa and they confirmed they would be refunding our money immediately.

2) another safari accommodation we booked and where the deposit was automatically taken off our credit card via [booking.com](http://booking.com) contacted us via eMail to finalise the full payment. We were unsure if this is a scam or a possible risk of money being paid twice, once from us directly and then again via bookingcom from our credit card.  
Solution: bookingcom agent confirmed this was legit from the lodging, it was a very highly rated and trustworthy company and we can pay them directly with peace of mind.

  
So yeah, while I understand and commiserate people have had bad experiences, I also wanted to point out that it is not all bad.   
Of course, I would not book flights on that website (or other third parties), so my experience is only around accommodation booking.",577,326,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1f4qx2n/unpopular_opinion_bookingcom_is_great/,2024-08-30 09:23:05,Booking.com
travel,booking.com SCAM - please be careful!,"I have an upcoming trip to Japan with my boyfriend in October with all our accomodation booked. I received a message today in the booking.com app in the property tab. Basically, it showed up as a completely normal message within the booking.com app itself that appeared to be sent to me by the property directly.

It was a long winded message with good spelling and grammar (not like typical spam messages). It said that my credit card didn't pass security checks, and that if I didn't update my card through the link in the message within 24hrs, that my reservation would be cancelled ""as per their policy"". I know this probably sounds obvious reading it now, but since it came directly through booking.com's messaging centre, I wasn't sure whether it was real or not for a while. (I did not click the link!)

I contacted booking.com customer support to notify them of this message I got. But I found their response quite vague, basically that they would investigate. Since I still wasn't 100% certain that it was fake and they were threatening to cancel the booking, I called the hotel directly to confirm my booking.

Luckily, I didn't forget too much of the Japanese from when I was on an exchange program a few years ago! But when speaking to the hotel, in conversation when I said booking.com, he immediately asked whether I'd received a ""weird message"" So clearly they were aware they had an issue. But he thankfully confirmed that my booking and credit card details were both fine.

Moral of the story, please be careful if you receive any weird messages around your upcoming trips!
And be suspicious of all links and all messages, even if they seem legit at face value!

travel,Booking.com is a scammer,"I booked an apartment through this app for my stay in Los Angeles from August 16 to August 19. To my utter disbelief, when my family and I arrived at the location listed by [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), we were completely ignored. Not a single response from the property. I reached out through text, call, and email—absolute silence.

I had traveled all the way from San Francisco, exhausted and expecting a smooth stay, only to be left stranded with no place to go. Imagine the frustration of standing there, with my family in tow, in a city we didn’t know, and receiving no help whatsoever from the property.

It took ages to finally connect with Booking.com’s customer service, and after waiting in desperation, a representative told me that my only option was to cancel and find another place to stay. I was furious. At that point, I had no trust left in this app, so I refused to book anything further through them. The representative filed a complaint for me, informing me I would have to wait 14 business days for any sort of refund.

Well, here I am, nearly **two months** later, and I’m still waiting. I’ve followed up multiple times, only to be told that the refund is delayed because they can’t reach the property. **Really?** [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) has tried to contact this unresponsive property, I’ve tried, yet this nightmare of a place continues to ghost us all.

At this point, it’s clear to me: this property is either a scam or simply doesn’t exist. And what’s worse—Booking.com has proven to be powerless in resolving this issue or protecting its customers. Instead of taking responsibility, they keep sending the same robotic emails, claiming they still need more time to get a response from the property. It’s been **two months**—how long does it take?

I will **never** book through this app again. If you’re looking for low-cost accommodations, do yourself a favor and go with Airbnb. If you want a reliable hotel, try Hotels.com. But whatever you do, steer clear of Booking.com unless you enjoy being abandoned in a strange city and chasing a refund that may never come.",776,337,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fru0rh/bookingcom_is_a_scammer/,2024-09-29 02:10:03,Booking.com
travel,Shady tactics at Booking.com,"I will definitely never use this service again. 

We used them to book a suite in New York City for my family of six. We’ve had the reservation for two months. 10 days before we are set to travel we get an email from them saying that the hotel just rejected our reservation because of “improperly loaded rates.”  And it would be canceled. They suggested a different hotel - which was way lower quality and on the other side of Manhattan. We need to be in a specific location due to an event we have to attend. So I emailed back-and-forth with them for a couple of days trying to figure out what was going on and see if they could find another reservation but nothing was adequate. I was communicating with different people – none of them had any idea what the person before had told me. 

I called the hotel directly and they said that our reservation wasn’t canceled and they’ve been getting lots of calls from people having issues with booking.com for the same reason. But the reservations are totally fine on their end. So we just booked the reservation directly through the hotel.  

We  called  booking.com to make sure the reservation was canceled and it was a 25 minute phone call. On hold. Transferred multiple times. For what should’ve been a very simple cancellation process.  You can’t cancel online. You have to call them.  

Finally got confirmation that the reservation was canceled. Then two days later we get a confirmation that one of the alternate suggestions they had made for us is confirmed.  Even though we told them we didn’t want that reservation. Then we had to go through the same process to cancel that reservation. 

Seems like they have some super shady tactics going on.",840,286,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18i86f8/shady_tactics_at_bookingcom/,2023-12-14 13:03:46,Booking.com

I'm hoping the ABC might be able to put a rocket up someone's arse, but frankly after my dealings with this company, I doubt it.

My advice,  if you make a booking with a booking platform, make sure you get something from the property owner and steer clear of Booking.com!

Also, someone who picked up that it was a scam, has now given the listing a BAD review with a 1 star rating...hopefully this might deter someone else from making a booking!

travel,Beware of fake booking.com listings (I was scammed in London) ,"I booked a say in an apartmenr through booking.com, it was nonrefundable but it was a decent price for Mayfair, London (2000£ for 4 nights) and looked very nice. I was booking quite last minute so I booked it without much thought as I have only had positive experiences with booking apartments. 

The day before my check in I received a message that I have to PayPal the host 1500£ as a safety deposit to receive the address - this seemed very sketchy. Then I found the photos listed again but this time as a different apartment and different location - I knew I was being scammed!

I called the customer support and that was the worst experience ever because after speaking to 3 different people and a manager, I was told to pay the PayPal fee outside of booking as they believe it is real and as I agreed to the property policy by booking with this host! I informed them about the duplicate listings and if they can guarantee the paypal money if I don’t receive the address, they said they can’t guarantee that! Booking told me that if I don’t PayPal the money to the host I won’t even get a refund form booking. 

So I paid the fee and hoped to receive the address, guess what, I didn’t get anything despite repeatedly reaching out to the host. 

I called my local booking support not their international one (never call the international support they are incompetent), my local support said these scams happen every day now and they called the host. The customer support guy said the scammer was screaming at them and was hysterical and rude for being exposed. I received my PayPal and booking money but stayed in the center of London without a place to stay.

I love staying at apartments but with booking and airbnb scams happening every day, I have to recommend everyone to stay in hotels until booking.com manages to put better anti-scam policies into place. I was lucky my local support helped me, the international support basically just kept repeating - “no worries mam we think the listing is real, we can’t help you”

travel,Beware of Fraud on Booking.com,"I wanted to share a recent experience I had on Booking.com that I think everyone should be aware of. I’m a frequent traveler and a Level 3 client on the platform, and I recently encountered what seems to be a new type of scam that left me both shocked and frustrated.

Here’s what happened:

I booked a place in Los Angeles through Booking.com, expecting the usual reliable service. According to the listing, the check-in time was 4 PM. However, the host claimed they wouldn’t be available until 10 PM, which seemed suspicious. I immediately contacted Booking.com’s support, expressed my concerns, and was told that if the host didn’t respond within 30 minutes, the booking would be canceled. The host, though, only communicated with Booking.com, creating the appearance of a legitimate property while refusing to accommodate us. This seemed like a tactic to force us to cancel, which would result in a 100% loss of the booking fee.

After hours of waiting and escalating the issue with Booking.com’s management, they assured me that I could book another hotel, and they would cover the price difference and refund the original $2,200 payment. So, at around 1 AM, I booked another hotel nearby for $2,600. But here’s the kicker: Booking.com only refunded $100 from the original payment and later refused both the reimbursement and the full refund they had promised.

It appears that this scam involves hosts who create fake listings and manipulate communication with Booking.com to pressure travelers into canceling their bookings, allowing the host to pocket the payment without providing any service. I’m now considering legal action against Booking.com for failing to uphold their contractual obligations and leaving me out of pocket.

If you’re using Booking.com, please be extra cautious and scrutinize the listings, especially if they have very few or suspiciously perfect reviews. I don’t want anyone else to go through what I did.

travel,Rethinking using Booking.com again - they removed my legitimate negative review which tells me their reviews are gamed,"A few months back, I shared an underwhelming experience I had at a place in Taormina, Italy, which you can find here: https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/la-bergerie.html. 

I won't dive into all the details again, but in summary, the images were highly deceptive. The only way to catch a glimpse of the view was to stand and lean out from the balcony. Both the building and the rooms were a bit run down. As for the breakfast, it was a disappointment, offering a meager serving of a runny egg, some bread, and a handful of fruit.

After much contemplation, I decided to leave a negative review of 4 our of 10, especially considering the over $300 per night rate for what felt like a dilapidated establishment. For comparison I checked other rates in the area and we had traveled around Italy for 2 weeks.

Our choice to stay there was influenced by the misleading photos and reviews, even though there were several other options at nearly half the price.  And the beautiful view of Isola la Bella shown in the pics also was a factor.

My review was composed with professionalism and restraint, merely pointing out that the images did not accurately reflect the property and the breakfast certainly did not justify an additional €20.

Subsequently, the host contacted me via WhatsApp, imploring me to delete my review. I blocked her and reported the incident to Booking.com, who assured me that they would address the issue with the host. However, I received no further updates.

Recently, my thoughts revisited this ordeal, prompting me to check the listing again, only to discover that while my rating remains visible, the written content of my review has been removed, replaced with a message stating it was hidden for not adhering to their guidelines.

This incident underscores the unreliability of Booking.com reviews and serves as a cautionary tale.  They clearly remove bad reviews and push up the good ones.  In fact, when looking at places and seeing the reviews in the sidebar one never sees a negative review.  One has to select ""see all reviews"" and then sort by lowest.

travel, How Booking.com’s Communication Error Cost Me My Flight and $824 - Warning to fellow traveler's ,"I want to share my frustrating experience with Booking.com to alert others about how poorly they handle customer issues, especially when their own communication errors cause significant problems.

The Situation:

I had a flight scheduled for 18:00 on 25 of july going back home, 24 hours before departure on 24 of july, I received an email from Booking.com confirming this time. However, upon arrival at the airport, I discovered the flight had been rescheduled to 15:15.

**for people telling me i should have checked the airline, I didn't, and it's my fault for trusting the email sent to me by booking 24 hours prior to my flight, which was wrong**

My Experience with Customer Service:

I immediately contacted Booking.com’s customer service, only to be told that it wasn’t their responsibility since they sent an email on the 1st of july upon checking the spam folder i found an email from not booking but Gotogate (a third-party partner)  that mentions the flight was reschedule to 15:15 on the 1st of july, which i didn't read as it was in my spam email and it was an email from a third party that i didnt know about, even if it was true, I received a conflicting confirmation directly from Booking.com on the 24 of july which was a day before the flight confirming that the flight is on 18:00 even the time on the app wasnt changes, which i know they do as the first fight to the country i was visiting even changed and i got the update from booking and not a third party.

- After being stuck at the airport for nearly 7 hours, I had to book a new flight for $824 out of my own pocket.
- When I escalated my complaint, their response was shockingly dismissive. They insisted there was no communication error, blamed me for not checking the itinerary change, and even had the audacity to suggest that if I didn’t like how they handle requests, I shouldn’t use their platform.

This is the exact response I received:

""Hi, 

We're sorry to hear you feel that way.

There's no higher authority to escalate your complaint to; reservation-related requests are handled only by our Customer Service and no one else. If you don’t accept the scope of how we handle your requests, *please, do not use our Platform in the future.*

travel,"My hotel cancelled the stay, so I can't leave an honest review on Booking dot com and won't refund","I booked a hotel via Booking dot com. The reviews and pictures were great. Once there, I pay for all 5 nights. Two nights later, I get a message from Booking asking if I paid and if I'm staying there. I answer honestly, and simultaneously get a message from the owner saying he cancelled the booking to save on commission.

Into our second nights, we (5 people in three rooms) notice several cockroaches. That's in addition to the rooms being dirty and not looking at all like the pictures, and service being almost absent.

We were supposed to stay five nights, but checked out after two. Because the owner cancelled, which I never agreed to, I can't leave a review, and I can't get a refund either (and the owner insistantly won't refund even a part of the last three nights).

I contacted Booking to explain the situation and to bring awareness on this shady hotel (still waiting for a response). I guess their incredible reviews are fake, and then because they cancel, they are able to avoid honest reviews.

It's the first time something like this happens to me, so I (we) didn't have the insight to take pictures and videos. If it happens again, I'll know to take evidence at least.

Anyway, just a message to bring awareness (to at least take picture and video evidence, including screenshots of any shady messages from the owner (the owner deleted messages before I could take screenshots)). I feel cheated. That's not even mentioning the rats we saw on that same street and the stench inside the hotel rooms, while the hotel is rated 9.2 on Booking and 4.5 on Google Maps. Still hoping for some help from Booking, or at least see their dishonest listing taken down.

Edit: minutes after I left an honest review on Google Maps, our (my family and I) Facebook profiles got bombarded with dozens upon dozens of mean comments from bot accounts. It went for 2h, then stopped, at which point the owner sent me threatening messages. A crazy experience.

Last week I received an email from ""noreply@booking.com"" containing all my reservation details and stating that I had to access a link to enter my card details in order to validate it.
 
If I had not entered my card details, I would have lost the reservation - it was also stated in this email. 

After entering and validating the payment (which was said to be refunded in a few seconds) nothing happened and then the person who obtained my card details tried to take money from my card again but I realized what was happening and refused a second payment. 

At that point, from a ""support"" pop-up opened on the payment site I was asked what the available balance in the account was. 

In the meantime I contacted both booking.com and the accommodation and received the following answers:

- the hotel says they didn't receive any money from me, obviously
- booking.com says they are very sorry about the situation, that the email did not come from them, that my private data was leaked and so the hackers could compose that email with my reservation details and I have to check with my bank to block my payment and get a refund.",237,164,https://i.redd.it/y2xgexvam5ec1.png,2024-01-23 08:55:39,Booking.com

So I've booked an accommodation to spend my honeymoon in Stockholm with my wife. It seemed nice and had a LOT of positive reviews and also had a nice feature of online self check-in which was important to us as our flight arrived at about 11 pm.

3 days before check-in I wanted to get an idea of how their online check-in process works and there was no info except message from the property stating that ""by now you should receive all the info & instructions you need to check in yourself by SMS and email"". I'm not even sure if the accommodation had my phone number or email at that time. I've tried to reach to them but they've sent me few template answers stating similar things. After a while they requested my phone number and email and said that they sent me a link but unfortunately it never happened. So I tried to reach them both by email and booking\_com private messages but I got nothing.

Then I had many phone calls with booking\_com support during 3 days before check in and they said that they tried to make phone calls to the property to 3 phone numbers they know but got 0 response and the only available option for me is to come to the place after check in time and if there'll be nobody to check me in, they'll start a relocation process ASAP to a property of better or same class.

So we've just let it happen and when we arrived to Stockholm there were obviously nobody at the property that late to help us. I gave booking\_com support a call (bunch of them actually during 4 hours from 2 to 6 am :() and all I got is few links to book a properties which were already unavailable to book or were available only starting from the next day and were actually worse than what we've booked and also they offered me to book something on our own and they cover the difference to a 25 euro MAX which is again nothing knowing prices in Sweden.

This morning, I received a direct message from the Host of a place I booked and has asked me to cancel my booking as they have sold the property. My booking is non-refundable so I've asked them to cancel it on their side in hopes of receiving a refund.

My next step now is to contact the customer service as this isn't my fault but wanted to see if there are any other advice as I've also heard their customer service isn't the greatest.

UPDATE: booking is canceling the reso but also asking me to book a new place that is roughly $100-$150 more and isn't covering the difference.

stating: ""I regret to inform you that we have confirmed that one bedroom one bathroom and one kitchen with independent access are unable to accommodate you due to change of ownership."" and they went on to say they're only covering any addition expenses I incur while at the new property they told me to book..

I requested a refund instead.. not booking with them again.

  
Final update: forgot to say, booking tried offering me a new reso which was MORE than what i paid, wasn't going to cover the difference but will cover any expenses i incur while on site. i end up refusing and asked for a refund, i was refunded within 7 business days or so.",147,65,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1f7zqd7/bookingcom_host_told_me_to_cancel_my_booking/,2024-09-03 13:18:56,Booking.com

travel,Booking.com lied to the Visa dispute team and won’t give me my refund of $375,"A while ago I made a refundable hotel reservation through Booking.com that I later cancelled within the allowed time frame to get my money back. A few weeks go by and the refund doesn’t show up on my credit card (Capital One) so I call Booking’s customer service.

Rep said that their system indicates they already sent out my refund, so I need to call my bank. When I asked if they could issue me confirmation that they sent out the refund, I was told no because they “cannot share personal information” (I’m the person who the information is about but okay)

I contact my credit card company, they open a dispute for the charge. Of course they reach out to Booking. To my utter astonishment, Booking.com responded by saying that my reservation was not refundable and that actually I never cancelled it. Even more unbelievable was, they also said that I never put down a deposit. The refund in question is FOR the deposit I put down.

I provided mountains of documentation from my confirmation emails, the clearly outlined cancellation policy, time stamps to prove I followed the rules, parts of Booking’s terms and conditions that support my case, examples of (unrelated) glitches on their platform to show that their system isn’t perfect, a screen recording of myself making a refundable reservation on their site (with the same exact hotel) and then cancelling it to demonstrate how their system works. 

Every single time I send in new evidence, the dispute team says that what I provided was insufficient to disprove booking’s claims. Every time this happens I call the support team and they tell me a NEW thing that I actually needed to provide instead. Then I’ll provide that thing and they’ll deny me again, the cycle repeats.

Every time I call, they also suggest that I provide types of documentation that I ALREADY gave them, sometimes more than once. I’m convinced they are not even reading what I’m providing them, just outright denying me and hoping I just give up.

I’ve spoken to a lawyer who told me that even though I’ve proved my case beyond a reasonable doubt, I don’t really have any options for taking legal action.

How do I get my refund back? How do I get the dispute team to listen to me? Has anyone else had this experience? Is this normal??

I’m so disappointed because I use Booking ALL the time and have never had an experience like this with them.

Update (4/17): I called Booking.com back and recorded them telling me directly that I’m owed a refund. Sent this to Capital One along with a request that they provide specific information in their response to me to prove that they’re actually looking at the stuff I’m sending them.

I am really hopeful I can get this resolved.

travel,Host asked for a payment on their personal account and insulted me afterwards. Can host retaliate because I reported them to booking.com?,"I've booked accommodation on Booking that states no prepayment is needed. However, after booking the host sends me a message asking for me to do a transfer to their personal bank account to guarantee my booking.
They wanted 30% of the amount transferred now and the rest by a certain date. They said it is to avoid people canceling last minute and to weed out those who aren't serious about staying there. I contacted Booking asking them if it's safe for me to make a payment to personal bank account and how much guarantee booking can provide in such scenario. My goal wasn't to report them but to get more info on how much booking can protect me if payment is made in such a way. A couple of days later, the hosts send me an extremely passive aggressive message (very petty tone) telling me booking is investigating their account and that as far as they're concerned I do not have a reservation on those days.
They said they could not cancel the reservation (that I should do that) and if I don't and show up, no one will be there to let us in. I ignore the message and cancel the reservation. The next day they sent me another message insulting me. Obviously I think this is unacceptable - first the retaliation by telling us they are canceling our reservation for asking a question to booking and then the insults, so I reported this to booking.

1. GF rents car with Europcar through Booking, using my name as driver.

2. We pay, payment goes through. We don't receive a confirmation email on the day we booked but payment is made.

3. The next day, Booking automatically cancels the original reservation, refunds it, and immediately remakes it, but this time under her name, not mine. All automatically.

4. We don't think anything of the new email, so don't check the info,  which now has her name as the driver. We didn't make any changes ourselves or received any cancellation email for the original booking.

5.  Months later, arrive to pick up car, can't because driver's name is wrong.

6. Try calling Booking, can't because we don't have a pin number. (find out later you have to dispute the claim online to get a pin in the first place - no info or phone number on their website relating to this issue).

7. Rental company cancels booking.com's reservation, we end up paying 3 times the amount for a new booking directly with rental company on the day for the same car. What was a $320 car is now a $906 car.

8. Call [booking.com](http://booking.com) to try to get a refund after the trip, they have no record of europcar's cancellation. We are told we are not entitled to a refund because it is after the fact and we never picked up the car.

9. Call again, are told to use the website to seek refund from customer service. Get hung up on again when asking if they aren't customer service on the phone.

10.  Call again, hung up on as soon as they read the case notes.

travel,Scam inside booking.com website,"Hey fellow travelers! 

Just wanted to share something that happened recently to me. I have heard of this scam before, where people were contacted by ""hotel managers"" on WhatsApp, via email or something else, after they booked accommodation with Booking. 

However, this happened to me inside [Booking.com](https://Booking.com). I have a trip to Thailand scheduled for December and have been booking hotels at Booking. Never had an issue with them. Yesterday, I received a message on the chat page, from one of the hotels directly, saying there was an issue with the payment of my booking and that I needed to update the credit card info. If I didn't update it within 12 hours, the reservation would be cancelled.

 I thought it was strange because, recently my husband travelled with his family and the same thing happened to him, but he was contacted by Booking asking to update the CC info. This time, it was the hotel, which did not seem legit. 

They sent a message with all my booking info, my name, the dates, etc. There was a fishy link, something like ""booking.youassistant-live"" with the same interface as the original website. What was strange to me was that, on this page, it wasn't asking me to update the CC info only, it asked me to fill out every reservation data again, name of guests, ETA, special requests. On this page, there was also a pop-up like a chat, explaining the same thing as the email that I received, that I needed to update everything, they would just block the amount on the CC and release it immediately. I sent this chat a message asking for assistance and the reply I got was ""pls wait"". 

This was enough to get me and my husband to call [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) assistance line. We talked to a very nice lady, she explained all of the payment process to us, said this was very likely a scam and suggested that we cancelled this reservation. She said that, if we chose to keep it, we could just ignore the email/message on chat and the reservation would be kept and we would have no issues when arriving at the hotel, since the message was not legit. But I just didn't feel like staying at a place where an employee tried to scam guests. 

She told us to try and only book rooms in which the payment is dealt exclusively by Booking and not by the property. She taught us how to check this info when booking and said this type of scam is becoming ""popular"" in Asia and Europe. She also recommended that we try to book only chain hotels and never book something in a big city that has fewer than 1,000 reviews. 

Well, I do know this scam is well known in travel blogs/forums, but since this is the first time it happened inside the Booking platform, just thought I would share it here to make folks extra cautious when receiving communication like this. Trust your guts! I trusted mine and was able to avoid being scammed this time.

travel,9 stays with booking.com over 8 weeks in Eastern Europe here's what I learned and some tips,"I did an 8 week trip to Europe with the vast majority of stays being apartment types mostly booked on booking.com and 2 with abnb. I only had one stay that wasn't up to expectations but for the most part everything went smoothly. Countries included Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia. 

Breakdown  
3 bookings direct  
1 on Agoda  
9 on Booking.com  
2 on abnb  

Here is what I learned and some tips.

Only book stays with more than 9+ rating, 20 reviews and at least a few positive recent reviews. Booking doesn't automatically sort reviews by newest, so be careful of that. Also seeing several different languages also shows more likely real reviews. IME, people only review if it is very good or very bad and not if it's just okay. No recent reviews is a red flag. 

Most places listed on booking are also listed on abnb and other sites. Sometimes one site is cheaper or has better cancellation options than others. Also looking at abnb gets you more reviews to look at. Booking tended to be cheaper than abnb and had the best cancellation options, but occasionally abnb did which is where I went to abnb.

Booking.com's mobile app is sometimes significantly cheaper than the desktop. I found it hard to search the mobile app so I would search on the website, find my spot and then compare prices on to the mobile app. A pain, but saved me 100s of $$ over several stays. Also, the mobile app lets you message the host before booking whereas that option is only available after on the web version. In the few places booking direct was an options, Booking.com, Agoda and Expedia were still often cheaper and easy to mange. 

Booking generally doesn't tell you if there are stairs or elevator available. Not a problem for me, but in a lot of places in Europe 1st floor tends to be up a flight of stairs. I try to mention it in my review so other people can see it. 

Booking doesn't distinguish between somewhere having a washer and a washer and dryer. If a dryer is important to you, message the host. 


If traveling with 2 people, look for places that have comfy sofa for sleeping on. Unfortunately, we hit a heatwave and sleeping with 2 people in a smaller European bed was uncomfortable. The A/C tends to be in the living area and doesn't always cool off the bedroom if separate.

Have WhatsApp on your phone before you go. I didn't have WhatsApp and I couldn't register for it once I was abroad because it won't accept Google Voice. My bad, but I thought I could send and receive international texts on Google Voice. Many hosts preferred to be contacted through WhatsApp before and during the stay for instructions and such. One place wanted to send a video of parking instructions and couldn't through the booking messaging. 

Reasons for booking was most places I went didn't have western hotels (or any hotels) near the city center, most of my stays were 4-7 days so I wanted a kitchen and laundry, wanted a bit more space than a hotel room could provide.

I have used booking many times over the years and never had any problems. I know it comes up every once in awhile on this sub, so I wanted to share if you use common sense, you can use booking safely. Outside of the US where there aren't a lot of chains and booking direct isn't feasible, booking is a good booking tool. I also highly encourage you to review spots as that is very helpful to everyone.

Using these guidelines, I didn't have any major problems. Only one spot wasn't up to par and frankly it was a desperation booking that had an 8.5 rating, but a good location and parking near a city center which was important. It was habitable, but had problems (leaking shower, no hand soap, just not very nice).",61,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gb7k6d/9_stays_with_bookingcom_over_8_weeks_in_eastern/,2024-10-24 17:00:34,Booking.com
travel,Recent n=1 Booking.com vs Direct,"I have been using Booking.com for a long time. I'm a ""Genius Level 3"" which, I don't know if that's common or what, but I imagine it must be just based on volume. 

For a recent 4 night trip I decided to do all my bookings direct with the hotels since we are always hearing about how Booking is sucking them dry by taking their cut and if you book 3rd party, you get the worst rooms and treatment. 

Here's my observations, again, just from one trip for one person. 
 - 3 out of 4 rooms were the worst in the hotel. Right by elevator, on the street, the one with the weird layout, whatever. On booking I feel like I pretty much always get the best rooms, and often received upgrades. 
 - cancellation policies were not as generous 
 - my notes on arrival time, amenity usage, etc were not looked at in 3 of 4 cases
 - prices were the same, or a bit higher booking direct 
 - check in and checkout were the same
 - way less convenient to keep track of 4 reservations and correspondence than it is on Booking
 - no one to call if something goes wrong
 - I don't accumulate credits in Booking like I normally do

Overall, would not book direct again unless it was a hotel I really really wanted to stay at and they weren't available on Booking. 

Yes, maybe I just got unlucky on 3 of the places. The last hotel I booked in Booking was HORRIBLE and after telling Booking I got a complete refund plus additional money credited to my account.

travel,"Argentina…..MEH!
","After reading a recent thread about how wonderful Argentina is, my thoughts after visiting last month. 

I was a couple of weeks and visited Buenos Aires, Bariloche, El Calafate, Ushuaia and Iguazú. From best to worst: 

Iguazú: the falls are really astonishing.

Ushuaia: very interesting, unique place

El Calafate (Perito Moreno): definitely worth it but for some reason the glacier wasn't that wow feeling I had in Iguazú

Bariloche: rented a car. Cool place but honestly you can see the same stuff or better in some parts in Europe or North America (Alps, Rocky mountains, etc)

Buenos Aires: ran down hole. I spent three days and there were too many. Unsafe, uber expensive, for a big city there are plenty more interesting in Europe and even North America. 

Now the bad things:

**- Safety:** Argentina is NOT a safe country. Buenos Aires is not a safe city despite how locals will try to convince you. Whoever says ""central Buenos Aires is like New York/Miami/London/Paris"" is in complete denial.

I never left premium areas (Puerto Madero, Recoleta, Palermo, Belgrano, Microcentro, etc.) and you could see people (locals!) looking around while using their phones. Or whenever I walked down the street, if I ""overtook"" another person on a walkway, he or she will look back to check that I was not ""safety threat"". Many people with their backpacks on the front.

I took Ubers back and forth to La Boca and the areas around where complete slums. I wouldn't have liked my Uber broke down there. xD

On the other hand for instance Ushuaia felt safe. But Ushuaia is a small town isolated from the world.

**- Prices:** I was not expecting Argentina to be cheap but it is a complete joke now. Prices make no logic. The dollar blue (more convenient) is now roughly 10% more convenient than the official rate. So it was not about me exchanging dollars in the wrong places. 

  
Just an example. The Prison in Ushuaia (a small local museum) was 36.700 ARS in September (maybe the prices have been increased because inflation and the website is not updated)

[https://museomaritimo.com/en/visitenosen](https://museomaritimo.com/en/visitenosen)

That means that in the ""dollar blue"" (the unofficial more favorable exchange), it is 32 USD

[https://cuex.com/en/ars\_pa-usd](https://cuex.com/en/ars_pa-usd)

The Louvre museum (they recently increased prices) is 22 EUR. Or 23 USD

[https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/hours-admission](https://www.louvre.fr/en/visit/hours-admission)

So a small museum in Ushuaia is more expensive than the Louvre.

The minitrekking in Perito Moreno (walking in the glacier) is now 480,000 ARS + 45,000 ARS for the entrance to the park (compulsory). So a total of 525,000 ARS or (!) 466 USD just for walking in the glacier (with a group) for about 2 hours. It is nice but nothing really glamourous or private. Just a typical group being taken from left to right on big buses then big boat then big group walking the glacier. 

[https://hieloyaventura.com/tarifas/](https://hieloyaventura.com/tarifas/)

I have been quite a few times in Switzerland and once in Norway and I never felt that ""ripped off"". At least Switzerland/Norway are top notch, clean, wealthy countries, but no offence Argentina is at best a ""second world"" country. So you are paying those prices in quite a dysfunctional environment.

**- Inconvenience:** 

Argentina is quite a dysfunctional country so expect inconvenience. For instance, flights. I paid a fortune for domestic flights (I flew Aerolíneas and flyBondi) and I had a few big delays. I could see on the screens plenty of cancelled flights. And right now (as of November 10, 2024) there are strikes that leave airports closed. So good luck if you are stranded in Ushuaia which is like 3,000 km to Buenos Aires which itself is like 10,000 km to the US or Europe. 

My advice is that Argentina is not worth the visit right now. 

Prices are completely out of control. The inflation stuff changes all the time, so maybe booking a holiday 3 months from now means that in January (for instance) prices will be 30% more expensive (or cheaper). 

There are a lot of social issues (I remember - I read Spanish -) reading in the newspapers in the street that 52% of Argentinians live below the poverty line. That means strikes, crime, etc. that can affect you directly or indirectly.

Just wait for things to calm and it might be worth to visit. Skip Buenos Aires (just one day max to check it out) and venture into the nature that is worth visiting.

You cannot call as the telephone number goes to a ""free offer"" you can't opt out of  (9 out of 10 calls), and the emails response is that the email is not monitored and to call or go through the selfhelp on the app.  How the he'll are these people still in business?",100,118,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15od0sm/bookingcom_scam_and_they_dont_care/,2023-08-11 16:10:10,Booking.com
travel,Booking.com is a disaster,"I booked a nonrefundable hostel one day earlier than my flight was due to arrive (my fault). I realized the mistake 2 months in advance, and requested a change through the booking.com app that was 'Confirmed' by the property... except I guess it wasn't ever confirmed because my reservation is still for the original dates. 

The hostel contacted me today saying they were going to process my reservation as a no-show, and charge me for the full 4 nights. I asked them not to do that, since I'm arriving later today a few hours after their deadline. 

In attempting to work with the property, they became nonresponsive, so I figured why not try calling booking.com

After waiting on hold for 20 mins (long distance call), booking.com wanted me to go in-person to one of their locations in the US, and buy a physical card for $200 that would then allow me to collect a refund for the reservation. When I told them I'm not in the US, they hung up on me. 

Has anyone had similar experiences with booking.com? It feels a little scammy and I won't ever use them again

----

Edit: thanks everyone for the comments. I found the phone number through the booking.com app, but I agree with the posters here saying this is a scam/hack/whatever. Good thing I didn't turn over any CC or PI data :) 

The hostel also wrote me back saying they'd honor my reservation. I was never asking for a full refund. Instead I wanted to pay for the full 4 nights and stay the final 3. 

There are several upvoted posts here giving me a hard time, which is fine. All I can say is, sometimes it's easy to mix up dates especially when you're booking things on mobile during a 4-month backpacking trip.

travel,Urgent Warning: Phishing Through Booking.com's Messaging System!,"I've been a loyal Booking.com user for years, trusting them with countless trips. Yet, what happened recently has profoundly shaken my trust in their platform.

After securing a hotel for my September vacation, I received a seemingly authentic message via Booking.com's app. The notification and interface were all consistent with Booking.com's design. The message, which came supposedly from the hotel, can be found below (I've included a screenshot for reference):

*Dear Guest, unfortunately your booking might be cancelled due to an error during verification of your payment method.  Usually in this case Booking asks to verify your payment method and confirm your identity as a holder.*  

*You can verify your payment method through a personal link:* **\[malicious link removed for safety\]**

*Please enter your payment details and wait for verification  Booking will charge your payment method with your reservation amount, and in a minute will credit it back - this is your payment method verification  (Payment method verification is not a payment or deposit. You pay directly when you arrive at the hotel).   If you want to save your reservation, you must do it within 24 hours, otherwise the reservation will be automatically canceled.*  

*Kindest regards,*   


*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Hotel*

Confident in Booking.com's security measures and the legitimacy of the interface, I unfortunately clicked the link and provided my credit card information. What's even more alarming is that within mere minutes of this, an attempt was made to use my credit card for an online purchase. Thankfully, my bank alerted me with a confirmation code, and I was quick to act, immediately calling them and cancelling the card. No money was lost, but the damage to my trust is irreparable.

Here's my main issue: **How is it possible for a phishing message to be sent through the Booking.com app itself?** This isn't a random email in my spam folder. This is directly through an app that millions trust with their personal and financial data.

Attempting to reach out to Booking.com's customer service was, predictably, an ordeal in itself. It feels as if they're more geared toward attracting new customers than assisting loyal ones in times of distress.

Please let my experience serve as a cautionary tale. If a platform as big as Booking.com can have such glaring security lapses, we must remain vigilant everywhere. I sincerely hope they address this and ensure such incidents don't recur. The responsibility shouldn't be on us, the customers, to sift through legitimate and fraudulent communication on their platform.",64,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/163icx6/urgent_warning_phishing_through_bookingcoms/,2023-08-28 10:25:01,Booking.com
travel,Booking.com - scam or real?,"**UPDATE: It seems it was a legit request. I added a new card** (used a virtual one on which I had almost no money) **using the Booking app and in less than 5 sec my card was verified by Booking and my reservation was once again confirmed. I will update this post if they attempt to charge me.**   
  
So I received an email that has the format of a typical phishing message: asking for my card info by a short deadline if I don't want to be ""punished"" by having my reservation cancelled.

My reservation was confirmed months ago when I also added my card details (the same I use all the time). The payment was not made because it is a ""pay at the property"" type of booking.

Also, the message keeps saying I have to confirm the card details, but when I click on it, **it shows me the current added card** AND asks me to insert another one (instead of confirming the one already added)... ?!?

**Why I'm not sure it's phishing:**  
1.I didn't just receive the message in the hotel chat, but it is **embedded in the accommodation info on the platform** (attached photo).  
2. It is sent by one of the legitimate emails of [booking.com](http://booking.com) : [noreply-invalidcc@booking.com](mailto:noreply-invalidcc@booking.com)

I already contacted the hotel and [booking.com](http://booking.com) but none replied yet and I really don't want to lose this reservation. One option is to add a virtual card I have no money on and delete it afterwards (but I prefer to avoid this too).

Tl;DR: I received a weird Booking message that looks phishy but I'm not sure is fake

* some sites like Expedia have reward programs if you go through them - but that may be moot with the right credit card and airline or hotel reward program

travel,My Experience with Booking.com – Misleading UI and Poor Support cost me $500 in a minute,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share a frustrating experience I recently had with [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) in the hopes of helping others avoid the same situation.

I booked four tickets to Universal Studios Hollywood through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), paying $544. Shortly after, I realized I had selected the wrong date. I checked the website for cancellation options, and things got confusing here. The site had a clear message that said, *“It’s not possible to cancel or make changes after you book,”* but next to that, there was a “Cancel booking” button.

https://preview.redd.it/18l795v3h2sd1.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f8ec6f003f04203f1b3bf5c359364d3605c0ab8

Since the button was there, I assumed I could cancel the booking while it was still processing and make a new one. I wasn’t trying to cancel the tickets permanently; I was just trying to fix the mistake before it was finalized. Unfortunately, after clicking cancel, I was informed that I had already paid, and because the ticket was canceled, I had no access to what I had spent. $544 down the drain with a simple click.

I contacted Booking.com’s customer service multiple times to resolve the issue, explaining the contradiction between the cancellation policy and the presence of the cancel button. I wasn't expecting a refund, but I hoped to reinstate the ticket. Despite this, I kept receiving responses about the non-refundable policy, which wasn’t what I was asking for. I just wanted the tickets reinstated or at least a copy of the canceled tickets so I could try to resolve the issue directly with the ticket provider. Lesson learned that **reinstating a canceled ticket is also not an option** due to [booking.com](http://booking.com) ""technical limitation"".

It’s been a frustrating experience, and I wanted to warn others to use the first-party website to book their tickets instead. People who bought Universal Studio tickets from their website with the wrong date had a much better outcome.",0,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1ftfa1m/my_experience_with_bookingcom_misleading_ui_and/,2024-10-01 04:03:10,Booking.com
travel,The free airport transfer advertised by Booking.com is misleading,"I’m dealing with a frustrating issue *again*. For some cities and hotels, [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) advertises a free private taxi from the airport with your reservation. I booked a stay that met all the criteria listed, but there’s no clear way to redeem the free ride. You can find more details about the promotion here: [https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001](https://partner.booking.com/en-gb/legal-resources/what-know-about-our-free-taxi-promotion#question-203001)

This is the second time this has happened. The first time, I had to go back and forth with customer support for three days. Each time, they reassured me that they were “working on it” and would fix the issue. In the end, they couldn’t arrange the taxi, and we had to pay out of pocket. They did refund us, but only after we sent them the receipt, and the reimbursement came as Booking credit—not exactly ideal.

Now, I’m in the same situation again, and there’s still no straightforward way to claim the taxi ride. So if you’re banking on that airport transfer, be prepared to spend days on the phone with customer support to get what’s promised.

Edit: added an image showing the label on the hotel’s page.

The apartment itself exists, but it’s been hijacked by a scammer who gains access to vacant properties, claims them as her own, and then uses Booking.com to lure in unsuspecting travelers.

When we arrived, the supposed host never answered the door or responded to our calls. The phone numbers provided turned out to belong to other people who had nothing to do with the property. We were left stranded in the middle of August with nowhere to stay.

What’s even more infuriating is that after speaking with local residents, we learned this scam had happened before and was reported to Booking.com. Despite knowing about this, they allowed the listing to remain on their platform, endangering other travelers.

The response from Booking.com’s customer service was abysmal. They were slow, condescending, and offered so-called ""solutions"" that were anything but helpful. Rather than taking responsibility, they pressured us to accept substandard alternatives, fully aware of our desperate situation.

Despite traveling as a couple, most of the times, we liked to use it to have a ""taste"" of living as a local. 

Hong Kong, Paris, Copenaghen. Great experiences, back when people used to put their own homes/flats up for rent while they were abroad.

During covid we didn't travel and having a baby put a pause on our travelling.

This year we started travelling back in Asia (with our kid) and boy how shitty the whole Airbnb experience has become.

All of our visited places so far (2 in Philippines and 2 in Bangkok) have been so awful.

All places are just sub-rented places, they put a few things in, and they put it up on Airbnb. Dirty as hell, no amenities. Like we are 3 people but you find only 2 forks, 1 mug, 1 glass, etc. One of the places in Bangkok had mold.

It seems the Hosts have lost their common sense.

travel,Kiwi.com - Never book your flights here!,"I booked an international flight for €330 on [Kiwi.com](https://Kiwi.com)   
They confirmed it first and after a couple of hours the airline declined booking, so Kiwi cancelled it. The alternative flight option they provided was incorrect as in, the destinations were wrong (which is also weird now that I think but, well, I learned the hard way). They gave refund options as website credit (immediately) or back to original account (2-3 working days). This was a Friday. The flight I was booking was for the coming Thursday.  
I called customer support and they said they will fix the wrong alternative flight issue and take my case on priority and will update. 3 hours later, nothing. I did not want to take the risk of my money being stuck till potentially Wednesday could not wait longer for the customer support (which never reverted btw) so I opted for immediate credit to book another flight.  


THEY CANCELLED THE 2nd BOOKING AS WELL! At this point I realised they don't have trusted tie-ups with the airline companies and are showing wrong/unconfirmed flight listings and prices on their website. I wanted my money back and needed it to book my flights from a trusted travel agent as soon as possible. But this time they removed the option to receive refund back to source account!  
I contacted customer support and they gave me the same bullshit again and never got back.  


I eventually had to manage something else because I needed to have a booked flight. But it has been more than 10 days and they are saying things like ""as per designated team refund is no longer possible"" ""we are practicing policy"" after being solely responsible for causing the entire thing. Oh and they were kind enough to provide me 1 year EXPIRATION PERIOD FOR THE CREDIT !!!???  
I don't know if they are a scam or fraud company or not but definitely DEFINITELY UNRELIABLE. The is the last of the last things anyone needs to go through when travelling for important work. I hope this helps anyone having second thoughts regarding this 3rd party nightmare of a travel agent and wants to avoid unnecessary stress and disruptance.

We came 19:30 to the center of barcelona by free booking.com taxi, and we were 30min early when our “host” was gonna show us some instructions. We were told to meet up next to one supermarket, and while we waited, we got some food for our stay. 45 minutes later he arrived, very kind and showed us our room. The room was not the same as the pictures, but at that point we were just happy we got here and had gotten a alright deal for a room. We hadn’t met the other guests yet. I stayed up for some time editing some for my dad’s business, when I was done we got to sleep around 23:30. The second we did we heard “funny” noises coming from our neighbor. I went to pee and then I was sure. Bead squeaking, you guessed it. (Just to inform “quiet time” was at 23:00) the rest of the night we heard aggressive phone talking, people moving chairs and tables, more aggressive talking, etc.. I had drunken a lot of water that night. So I went for my second pee. Then, I smelled straight-forward super strong cannabis.(smoking was forbidden) It was unbearable. we locked our room whe. The smell got stronger and stronger while the aggressive talking got worse and worse. Later this morning I got up to shower, and in the shower was a horrible smell of nicotine. We obviously didint record anything when our main priority was to sleep when the flight had many long stopovers to get the best deal. We don’t have money to go out and rent another one, when 600€ is not something we can afford to waste. We have until Sunday, and we don’t know what to do.

travel,Booking.com/ShareBnB (not AirBnB) - Host wants me to cancel my booking,"Booked a stay for April 6-10 in Little Rock, Arkansas, back in November of last year, in preparation to see the upcoming eclipse. I made the booking through Booking.com. The host now wants me to cancel, for what they say are unforeseen circumstances/unexpected maintenance issues. I wasn't given any further specifics

Place is listed as non-refundable, and they want me to cancel on my end, promising that they'll send a refund straight to my bank account, but this raised a lot of red flags for me. Can't they cancel it on their end? I'm anxious and worried about losing this stay, and more importantly losing my money. I signed an agreement that I acknowledge the location is non-refundable, the host's policy states I will be charged the cost of the stay if I cancel. 

I've already sent a message in to Booking.com support, but is there anything else I should do? Really not looking to lose my money here.

[EDIT]
Would like to add that they're advertising this location as available on their social media as of a couple hours ago.

I got a text today saying my credit card has been declined somewhere, but dismissed it as spam. I have a reservation at a hotel tomorrow night, though, and just went into Booking and saw that my reservation had a red exclamation mark beside it. Clicking takes me to a warning that my card was declined when the hotel tried to take payment today and that I need to update my card or use an additional method of payment. It's all legitimate-looking, and the route to update my card on file with Booking looks the same as it ordinarily would if the card had expired, but there's nothing actually wrong with my card so I'm not sure what happened and am a bit leery about typing out another card's number or sending money via PayPal, just in case this is a convincing scam. Should I be concerned, or am I being overly paranoid?

My banking website doesn't tell me anything weird has happened with my card, but it may only display transactions that were actually successful.

travel,How much I spent traveling to 43 Countries in 571 Days,"My girlfriend and I are from the USA and have traveled for **571 days**. Both of us have kept track of every $ spent! My hope in sharing this info is to show that you can travel to some amazing places on a budget! 

The two of us worked for a few years after graduating from university and saved as much money as we could. We paid for everything ourselves (except the 10 days of accommodation my girlfriend's parents paid for). 

This is just one person's spend and we split everything we can (accommodation, taxi, groceries, etc). I'd love to answer any questions about the budget or destinations. If you have any questions, feel free to ask or DM me.

All numbers are in USD$.

**IN TOTAL I SPENT $24,866.42 or $43.55 per day. $6.05 over my planned budget of $37.50 per day.** 

THIS INCLUDES ACCOMMODATION AND FLIGHTS!!!

Some details about the categories:

Accommodation - In Europe: Airbnb/Booking.com is our primary accommodation provider, but we stay in hostels \~30% of the time. 

In Asia: we did not use Airbnb, primarily Agoda/Booking.com/Couchsurfing/Hostels/Guesthouses

Activities - This can be museums, renting motorbikes, group tours, etc.

Coffee - This is just coffee from cafes. 90% of the time I drink coffee at the accommodation.

Food - Food/Water/Etc bought from Supermarkets/Convenience Stores/etc basically any food that wasn't ordered from a restaurant/bakery.

Health - Travel Health Insurance, Dentist/Doctor Visits, Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Soap, Shampoo, etc.

Misc - This includes paying for bathrooms (ugh), Fees/Citations, and anything that doesn't fit in the other categories.

Mobile Phone - I don't have a travel phone plan from the States. These are just SIM Cards. I do not buy a SIM card in each country. Moldova had the cheapest SIM at $1.19 for 100 GB of data.

Souvenir - I try to buy a magnet in each country (I have forgotten to buy it for 5 of the nations)

Transportation(local) - Taxis/Uber/Local Bus/Trams/Marshrutkas, etc.

Travel - Anything that takes us from one city or country to another. Ex. Bus from Slovakia to Croatia, Flight from Rhodes to Cyprus. 

Our round-trip flights from the USA to Europe and the USA to Asia were paid with airline miles :)

travel,Booking.com flexible international flight tickets feels like a scam! Money making scheme with false promises,"I booked Air Canada tickets for Aug 24th, and now for certain unavoidable reasons need to move the tickets to Jan 2025.

I searched for same airline, economy tickets and found one with a fare difference of about 100CAD.

NOW, enter extremely inefficient booking.com customer service, who I have no option but to indulge with to reschedule my ticket: there is apparently multiple Classes within the economy class (there is no mention of it while one books tickets by the way), and the airlines apparently allocate different prices WITHIN the economy class.

The customer care rep took an hour to explain to me that he can do nothing really. The same airline, same departure and arrival stations is currently costing me 1500 CAD in fare charge(despite having a Flexible ticket). Note, the tickets that I'm seeing from the main website listing still show a difference of 100CAD, but apparently, the Class within the Economy class (I'm still having a difficult time trying to understand this logic) shoots up the difference to 1500CAD.

Booking.com is just scamming people to pay extra while booking tickets through them under the Flexible options, but not really providing any value when one needs to actually reschedule!",0,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1exx27b/bookingcom_flexible_international_flight_tickets/,2024-08-21 18:26:14,Booking.com
travel,Scam from booking.com listing,"I saw a listing on booking.com for an apartment but it was one of those that you have to request to book and can’t book right away. These booking requests only last 24hrs so after that they will cancel the request. I tried requesting once and then tried requesting again but the same thing happened and it got cancelled. 

There was a WhatsApp number on the listing saying I could contact the host direct so I dropped them a message. They took awhile to get back to be, by which my second booking request had expired. They asked if I wanted to book the place and pay now to secure the booking which I was okay to. I asked them if I needed to make another booking request, but they said they could send me a personalised booking link instead. The link they sent looked like a booking.com website!

I tried to make payment but it didn’t go through, my bank didn’t even notify me to authenticate the transaction. Weird though immediately after that the fake host messaged me and said she was notified by customer service that I have to authenticate it in my bank’s app which I though was strange how would they know I was at the payment stage? 

At this point I went to check the listing on booking.com but it was gone. I think the fake website wasn’t even a merchant site so they couldn’t actually charge my card thank goodness but after that the fake host asked if I wanted to pay via PayPal instead direct to them. She sent instructions and an email to send to and told me I needed to send it in euros and it had to be via transfer to friends not payment for goods and services. 

After that I blocked and reported on WhatsApp. Went in to check again this morning and the listing is back up!

travel,Unpleasant Experience with Booking.com – Seeking Community Advice,"Hello everyone,

I recently had a pretty unpleasant experience with [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) and I'm hoping to get some advice or hear about similar experiences from the community.

My wife and I booked a room in Malaga, Spain for our vacation from July 7th to July 12th, 2024. The accommodation was booked on June 15th, 2024, and everything seemed fine at first. But things quickly went downhill.

First, we tried contacting the accommodation multiple times between June 15th and July 5th, but received no response. Even a WhatsApp attempt on June 30th went unanswered. Since we were arriving at 1:00 AM, it was crucial to arrange a late check-in. Finally, with much effort, we managed to cancel the first night through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) and booked a temporary place for July 7th. 

On July 8th, we finally received a response from the accommodation, which was at a different address than originally booked – though only 3 minutes away, it was in an undesirable area.

We felt deceived as Booking.com insisted that the contract was fulfilled and washed their hands of any responsibility. We had to book a new place through Airbnb. Booking.com sees no issue here and does not recognize any breach of contract or deception. Now, Booking.com refuses to refund us the 1000 Euros.

Attached you can find our originally booked accommodation and then the accommodation at the new address. We didn't even enter the apartment because the area was so run-down. It resembled a crackhouse above a disco.

Looking forward to your thoughts and advice.

travel,Need help dealing with misleading hostel listing on booking.com,"I booked a hostel in Salerno through Booking.Com. There's a few things that have been misleading that really bother me. 

First, I booked an 8 bed dorm but there's actually 12 in the room they gave me. The room is significantly more cramped then what is shown in the pictures. This isn't really a big problem, it's just not what I paid for.  

Second, on the listing it says there's lockers. There are in fact 0 lockers. What hostel doesn't have lockers? The guy at reception said I can leave my bag with the front desk when I want and come get it whenever. I don't really feel comfortable leaving everything I own on this continent with a complete stranger who isn't going to be there the whole time, as they have to show other guests around, deal with housekeeping etc. 

Third, they made me pay cash which was not mentioned anywhere on the listing. They also refused to give me an invoice after I paid. This makes me worried they're going to pull some tomfoolery and charge me multiple times through Booking.Com which has my credit card saved. 

Fourth, they advertise beachfront when they are very clearly not. This isn't a real problem and I knew this going in, just by looking at it on a map but it still bothers me that they advertise it. You can't even see the beach from the building. 

Fifth, there's no outlets anywhere in my room. I have a power bank but what do I do after the first night? I think this has to do with them shoving 2 extra bunk beds in this room. 

What can I even do about this? I'd rather not go elsewhere as everything else is expensive, and this is the only hostel I could even find in the city. Can I get back some of what I paid given that the listing was not accurate and I'm receiving less than I was promised? It's $25 per night so I wasn't exactly expecting luxury, but the lack of a locker is really bothering me. I was shown all of this after I handed over my money. Should I just suck it up and deal with it? Threaten to leave a review? Do I even have a leg to stand on in this situation? 

I'm adding this question. Would you write off the 77€ I already spent on the 3 nights and find an air BNB? There's a few in the area that aren't terribly expensive but I'd much rather not pay twice. I'm curious what you might do in this situation.

travel,Is it safe to book on Trip.com? What is your experience with the website?,"Hi all!
I would like to know if it is safe to book from Trip.com. I usually fly with Qatar Airways and buy tickets straight from their official website, but the tickets are currently too expensive and I am looking for alternatives. I have found a bunch of cheap tickets on Trip.com, including flights for Qatar airways to my destination, but I’m feeling kind of skeptical buying from this website. I’ve seen some iffy reviews around and i’m even more uncertain. 
Most of the reviews seem like they are from people that tried to cancel their flights (which i’m not willing to once i book it).
Has anyone on here had a good experience with this website by any chance? If so, after you book the flight, how does one know if Trip.com has truly booked your flight with the specific airline?

travel,"When looking at a place on booking.com, check on google maps too.","This is for 3 main reasons:

1. I've seen a lot of fake reviews on booking.com, which are from both people buying positive reviews for their own business as well as buying negative ones for other businesses. I'm not sure exactly how they do it and I'm not saying that doesn't happen on google maps too, but generally from what I've seen google maps reviews will be more frequent and newer and there will be more volume of reviews. Often the review score on booking.com can be vastly different from Google maps.


2. They can put a different location on the booking.com map to make the place look like it's in a nicer area, closer to the airport, away from a main road, closer to the centre, closer to the water etc. Seen it happen a bunch of times, so always double check the exact location on Google maps. Google maps should usually be right because that's how people will actually navigate to their business.


3. Google maps will give you the street view, satellite view, and usually has more guest photos, which will give you a much better idea of what to expect.

***EDIT- I want to clarify that this is in cheaper parts of the world that I have seen this (SE Asia and India), and from what I've found out, there are agencies which make real bookings for the sake of negative reviews to game the system. Of course they can always pay people to leave positive reviews for their own property too. Perhaps it doesn't happen in first world countries as much. Either way regardless of the first two points, taking a moment to check the place out on google street view and look at their google review score is worth it.",160,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/yh7ptk/when_looking_at_a_place_on_bookingcom_check_on/,2022-10-30 07:22:50,Booking.com

Last week, an unrelated debit appeared on my credit card from [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) for approx AUD 5,400. (My several bookings for next year total less than this amount) I contacted my Bank, and that process was very unsatisfactory, one thing they said was to contact the merchant. While I lodged a formal complaint with the bank, I emailed [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) at [customer.service@booking.com](mailto:customer.service@booking.com) explaining that I had an unauthorised charge and providing details including the reference number on the charge. I received a response requesting various details on my booking. I replied that I did not have a booking which related to this charge, and restated my issue in great detail. I received another response requesting details of my booking.

The matter has now been resolved in that the charge has disappeared from my new credit card (the previous one was cancelled). I am still waiting to talk to the person at the bank handling my complaint but my primary objective has been achieved, the charge has disappeared. 

However, it is clear that [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) actively discourages any attempt at contact.

travel,Booking.com 10% off scam?,"Wondered if anyone had similar experience to this.

I've had issues with booking.com before and after the most recent one, swore I'd use alternatives or book directly out of principle but I still get the occasional email offer for 10% off that I have to use within two days. In this case, you get a maximum £85 off as a travel credit so to maximise the discount you'd need to spend at least £850.

As it happens, there's a longer stay I need to book coming up so I found a place that said £998 and when clicking on the ""select room"" button, the price kept changing to be somewhat higher (nice app guys). 

Anyway, I played around with it with different dates but once the dust settled on the original dates I chose, the price was £1083 which is coincidentally exactly the same amount as the ""discount"" I would get, but as an increase in price.

Pretty hard to prove that this is the case since it no longer shows me the old price and they bake in all sorts of other discounts to get to the price shown but if this is the case with all properties for the duration of these ""offers"" it seems illegal at worst and scummy at best.

I am currently sitting at the airport, patiently waiting for my final flight home after a long 16 months around the world. I have 5 hours to kill before I board. So if you have any questions, Ill be happy to answer as much as I can, to the best of my knowledge, to help anyone out. **Edit:** I don't want to discuss Total cost, but more than happy to discuss specifics.

In 2022, the company I was working for was coming to a close. It was at this time I was made redundant, and didn't really know what I was going to do. I have no kids, and nothing else tying me down.

travel,Some reasons why user experience of booking.com is pretty lacking and frustrating,"I was doing a search for hotels in Honolulu on [booking.com](http://booking.com) and frankly it sucks when I find out how some other travel sites offer a better user experience:

1- The price shown in the search result doesn't indicate if it's the total price including taxes or fees or not. Going to the hotel's detail page, I found out the price doesn't include taxes and fees. There are 3 different taxes plus at least a fee (usually resort fee) in Hawaii. It makes it hard to compare between hotels and if the total price is within one's hotel budget. Sites like [hotels.com](http://hotels.com) show the total price in the search results. I like this.

2- Whenever I change the date range, all the search filters get reset and I have to set them again every time. Annoying!

3- Sites like [hotels.com](http://hotels.com) show the location of the hovered on hotel on the map. This makes it easy and quick to know where hotels are located by just hovering over the different hotels. I didn't see this feature on booking.com. The pins on the map show prices too. Therefore it can be convenient to start at the map and see what the hotel is on the page.

I did notice once after I calculated the total for a hotel in [booking.com](http://booking.com), it was considerably lower than the same hotel on hotels.com. So once I select a hotel I like at hotels.com, I will compare its total price among different travel sites. Do your homework.

travel,Booking.com taxis - make sure you get a confirmation email,"Yesterday, I booked an airport transfer to my hotel via Booking.com. The transaction was confirmed and payment taken from my bank account.

I noticed that evening that it wasn’t listed on my bookings, so I searched my inbox and realised they hadn’t sent a confirmation. Other than the bank transaction, I had no proof I’d even booked it.

I called their call centre (not an easy number to find) and spoke to a lady who was about as useful as a chocolate teapot. She couldn’t help without a confirmation number, which of course I didn’t have.

So I disputed the transaction with my bank and made the booking again. The same thing happened a second time. I rang them again, actually got put through to the taxi department this time, who confirmed that my bookings had been rejected for an unknown reason.

Had I not done this, I would’ve found myself waiting for a taxi if paid for in the early hours in a strange airport.

God knows why their systems don’t tell customers when bookings are rejected. 

I have booked other taxis for the same trip and those ones did go through. So my tip is to not leave the confirmation page until you receive an email.

travel,"A warning about Booking.com's ""Partner Offers""","My dad was planning on visiting me for Thanksgiving and I booked him a nearby hotel.

I primarily use [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) for accommodation. I know it's usually better to go directly through the hotel, but sometimes I need to book a handful of places at once and I've just found this easier to do with one site. I've never had issues until now.

I saw the new ""Partner Offer"" feature on the hotel listing and it was 25% cheaper than the usual rate. The reservation can't be modified or cancelled, but I decided I was fine risking it. I get a hefty charge on my credit card for the full amount.

Fast forward two months, and my dad breaks his ankle two days before his flight. He's okay (thank goodness!) but travel will be tough. I've accepted I'll have to eat the hotel cost, but I decide to call the hotel to see if there's anything they can do just in case. Here's what happens next:

1. The hotels can't find my reservation and suggest I call Booking.
2. I call Booking, they say they can't see anything on their end since it's a partner, and give me the actual booking code that the hotel uses internally.
3. The hotel still can't find my reservation.
4. I call my credit card trip insurance line to ask about next steps. They say as long as I have documentation that I tried asking the hotel/booking partner for a refund, I can get reimbursed.
5. I call Booking again and tell them the hotel still can't find it, even with the internal code. I ask them to send me written documentation that they will not help me get a refund. They do.
6. I call the hotel again and tell them that even though they don't have the booking, I received a charge, and ask if they have suggestions for what I should do. They tell me to email a screenshot of the charge.
7. The hotel replies to my email saying they still can't find anything.
8. I call Booking again to remind them that they charged me for a service that was apparently never rendered. They hang up on me.
9. I call back again to a different agent, explain the situation again, they finally tell me they're going to find the number of the partner agency. They put me on hold for 20 minutes then hang up.

I'm not mad that I can't get a refund due to a medical emergency. I booked nonrefundable, I get it. This whole song-and-dance was just 1) doing my due diligence and 2) producing documentation for my trip insurance claim.

**What I AM livid about is the fact that this reservation didn't even exist. They took my money and ran. THAT is a scam.**

**And that's what I'm here to warn you about:** **that if you use the ""Partner Booking"" option, there's a chance the booking won't be made. But you'll be charged without a chance at a refund, anyway.**

So now I'm filing a chargeback on my card, as this officially falls into the ""services not rendered"" category.

I booked a direct flight via [booking.com](http://booking.com) from Iguazu falls in Brazil to Rio with the airline company [Azul](https://www.voeazul.com.br/us/en/home.html). Everything was confirmed and i was sent a reservation code so i can check my reservation at the airline's website. Everything is ok until this point.

I also see that the original flight IS STILL AVAILABLE at triple the price from both Azul and Booking websites, so there is no cancellation or something that justifies the itinerary change.

I contacted Booking but i got no helpful response (they told me that they are not liable for the changes and they are trying to fix this with the airline, but i don't think they will manage to do this on time).

I know that Booking is not liable for the airline change, but it seems that the airline tries to rip me off by changing my itinerary to sell it at a higher price, but i get no help from either Booking or Azul.

I wanted to share a nightmare experience I had with Booking.com during the Rugby World Cup in September 2023, hoping that others can learn from it or provide some guidance on what to do next.

So, a year in advance, my friends and I booked an apartment through Booking.com for our stay in France during the Rugby World Cup. Fast forward to the day of arrival, and things took a turn for the worse. The owner of the apartment was nowhere to be found, and all our attempts to contact them went unanswered.

In a panic, we called Booking.com for help, and they promised to find us an alternative accommodation. However, given the magnitude of the event, finding an available place proved impossible. It was well past midnight, and we were left stranded without a place to stay.

After some heated discussions, Booking.com suggested we find accommodation on our own and assured us that they would reimburse the amount we spent. Desperate, we ended up finding a place for the night, but it cost us a small fortune as the World Cup had hotels fully booked.

Fast forward to now, months after the incident, and we're still dealing with Booking.com. Numerous emails and calls later, the issue was escalated to a senior, who shockingly decided not to reimburse us. This is unacceptable! Any recommendations on what steps to take next would be greatly appreciated.",83,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/188cfl8/disastrous_experience_with_bookingcom_during/,2023-12-01 13:55:27,Booking.com
travel,REALITY CHECK: Morocco and general traveling,"So most of us have seem them this week, threads expressing disgust for the country that is Morocco. Most recent one being [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/z1cbyf/visited_morocco_the_people_really_let_me_down/) \- I've never seen so many uneducated, small minded comments in a thread on r/travel. And look at all the karma and awards being thrown around in return.

I'm now seeing posts and comments of people who had planned to visit Morocco, but feel they need to change plans ([eg](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/z2083j/planned_to_go_to_morocco_but_now_thinking_about/)).

As someone who loves Morocco, and has explored it, I want to discuss a few things in as little words as possible. 

**Morocco is considered a third world country.** Let that sink in. People are poor, people are desperate, but they're doing their best. With COVID and other such things, the country is suffering even more.

If you booked a honeymoon there with a nice hotel, or you booked a tour guide, you're obviously going to have a trouble-free time. But most of you want to visit and walk around solo, which isn't a problem, but it DOES come with the drawbacks of walking solo around a highly religious, third world country. 

Any person doing the smallest bit of research will see what to expect when you land in Marrakech. Many have an exotic dream about this city, but the reality is, its inhabitants rely on tourists. You can enjoy the city, no doubt, but you will be pestered. After Marrakech, I decided to leave and head to the coast. I spent the rest of my time simply travelling South. The less touristy, the less trouble (shocking right?).

Along the way I met amazing people and had some of the best experiences of my life. 

YES, people will bother you. YES, people will try and get as much money as they can out of you, because YES, they are poor and desperate for money. If you don't have the ability to firmly tell someone to leave you alone, or refuse to pay extra, then you SHOULD NOT visit Morocco. Part of the enjoyment of Morocco is experiencing the above. I can assure you that after a few days, you will be handling people easily. 

For example, when taking a taxi, I confirmed the location and cost BEFORE leaving. The driver literally tried to pall a fast one, but because I out right refused to budge, he dropped it. If someone at a restaurant tries to charge you more, out right refuse. Which brings me onto my next point.

Let me assure you, if you haven't broken the law, the police will be on your side -  In 2021, the tourism sector in Morocco contributed around nine billion U.S. dollars to the country's GDP. If someone is crossing the line with you, locals and authorities won't tolerate it. They are desperate for you to visit.

This beautiful country has a population of over 37 million people!! For so many of you to spread such ignorant onions as facts is simply wrong.

I will finish this post off by saying two Moroccan's saved my life. Very long story short, I have a peanut allergy. I hiked into the middle of nowhere, ate a stupid strudel, went into anaphylactic shock, and was CARRIED by strangers. Finally taken to hospital by taxi (no ambulances), I was saved.

For a community which is meant to be open, r/travel is an embarrassment.

It turns out the search for packages does not convert currencies nor indicate this on the search results, but if you do a search for hotels or flights independently, it shows the results converted. It's extremely misleading when your homepage shows the currency, and then results are different (especially when it's Canadian and US dollars and the other parts of the site don't behave like this). I likely understand the technical happenings - it's a different engine for these ""dynamic packages"" vs hotel and air only, but using booking.com for years and using packages, I could have sworn I've seen search results for dynamic packages showing my selected currency.

travel,Is it possible that I'm not being scammed on booking.com?,"Update 2024/10/02: I did the third party payment on their booking software, and it wasn't a scam. I'm writing this from the flat. So to answer my original question for future readers, it \*is possible\* that you're not being scammed. Some companies do get you to pay off-platform, which I learned actually used to be required on Booking.com. The ""100% scam"" comments are meaningless and wrong.

* Booking an apartment in the UK
* The booking process said this: ""You will be charged a prepayment of the total price at any time.""
* Entered credit card info when booking, and was charged a partial amount
* Got a message on [booking.com](http://booking.com) from the property stating I had to pay the remainder, which is a link to a third party site (it's on https://booking.booksterhq.com)
* I contacted [booking.com](http://booking.com) customer service and they said that the property is supposed to be charging me (booking.com does not charge me), so this is not necessarily suspicious

I'm just confused because every post I see on reddit calls this a scam, saying that the property would've had their account hacked or something. But is it possible that this is normal? My main hold up is that they are asking me for payment information again, despite already being charged a partial amount.

They told me to do it within 24 hours. I've clicked ln the link but still felt like I'm going to get scammed any minute. I actually dont want the rooms but theyll make me pay full stay for cancelling the booking. Its almost 700 euro for 4 days :/

Anyways its not me cancelling it but the hotel sent me a message. ""Or else we will cancel it"" with the link to the payment details. If they do cancel it, what are my options? Has anyone came across this before?

The email didnt mentioned any nonrefundable payment or we will still charge you when your payment doesnt go through.

What if booking.com were the ones to cancel it?

travel,"First flight ever, booked through kiwi.com, should I be worried?","Hey, so just recently I was desperately searching for tickets from Europe to Australia for this month, since I'm planning to visit family in Australia and return at the end of August. 

Searching around the web, prices were quite crispy but after a few days I found quite an okay deal on [kiwi.com](http://kiwi.com), seemed like a legit site, did a quick search but nothing much. Not only after buying the tickets I found a ton of negative reviews, which makes me quite worried. I have never flown before and since this is such a long flight, (3 stops and \~37h with one self transfer, the return flight is with 2 stops) I'm feeling quite nervous.

So pretty much, main things I'm worried about are delays, cancellations and missed flights, I've mostly made sure that I have enough layover time between flights, especially on self transfer (8h of layover), but still, are there any options to be certain that I will be compensated if I can't make it onto to the next flight because of an unexpected delay for example third party insurance, since kiwi.com's ""disruption protection"" has proved unreliable for many.

I have also heard a little bit about flights not being properly booked by [kiwi.com](http://kiwi.com), so is there any way to check that beforehand and be 100% sure?

Also a little confused about online check-in, Kiwi does the check-in only for Aegean airlines but for others like Qatar Airways it says to check-in directly with the airline, using the ""credentials below"" but there aren't any, it doesn't even have a PNR in the itinerary, does it take time to be issued by the airline, since that's something I read on their FAQ.

  
Mainly I'm just looking for peace of mind and maybe tips on how to make sure that I'll get to my destination without unexpected expenses and trouble. I hope everything will go smoothly and I'm just overreacting but better safe than sorry.

travel,"Nonrefundable Booking.com ""Partner"" Reservation","Truly kicking myself here. I thought a reservation I'd made for a hotel hadn't gone through (never received a confirmation email for some reason), so I went to rebook and saw a cheaper rate on [booking.com](https://booking.com). (I'm sure you see where this is going.) I didn't realize the ""partner"" rate meant another third party was responsible for the reservation until I saw it on the confirmation page. I knew this was bad news, so immediately called customer service as it said the room was still in the process of being confirmed. It was a nonrefundable rate, so of course they said I was out of luck and that it was all in ""the partner's"" hands now. The partner is Xigua Limited, which I can find very little about online.

So, my question—have you booked a partner rate before and has it turned out fine? I called the hotel to see if the booking.com reservation had gone through, and they confirmed both that *and* my original reservation were there. Of course now I'll have to cancel the original reservation because that one is indeed refundable.

I should receive '10% in travel credits'. It says they arrive at least 2 weeks after checkout. I wait and wait and nothing. I never get the credits.

I'm extremely annoyed, it's not about the money, but the dishonesty and scammy nature of this scheme. I'm annoyed enough to stop using booking dot com altogether. It's a personal preference, but I quietly despise dishonesty. Am I crazy, or mistaken, or just too obsessed with integrity?

**UPDATE #1**

I called them just now, got on hold for 20 minutes, explained to the staff member what happened (with specific details about a booking that should have yielded a 'Travel Credit' but didn't) - not just general complain but specific.. then...

travel,"Cross posted bc I’m a desperate gal. 🆘, need booking.com help😮‍💨","How tf do I talk to someone from customer service dept (from U.S) 

Buckle up for my Booking.com nightmare. (Short version is can anyone give me a way to get ahold of customer service?) I’ve tried emailing multiple times with no response. Actually I get an “error” message that it wasn’t sent. 
The phone number I found on google (that I’ve called 4 or 5 times, for 40+ minutes each time and just found out last night that it’s in the UK and has been costing me $3/MINUTE, so not only has this been a huge inconvenience, but it’s costing me so much more money🥲) 

I booked a non-refundable, pay when booking apartment stay through booking.com at the beginning of May. I normally try to book refundable for this exact reason, but it was SUCH a good price for the area. Thousands of dollars less than every other place. I got an email on May 28th that the company that hosts the apartments closed down so my booking was cancelled. I started calling booking.com around 3 weeks in when it still wasn’t refunded. They said to reach out to the host company bc they can’t do anything for 30 days. The host company closed down completely and the listed phone number wasn’t active. Or it had a full voicemail. Either way, no way to contact them. So then I called booking.com after 30 days and talked to them about getting a refund and they said they would reach out to the company then get back to me. 
Of course they never got back to me so I called them a week later (was already annoyed at the 40 minutes I wasted each time, but now LIVID that I’ve paid $3/minute for the colossal waste of time, ugh) and they said that I needed to fill out a document they would send me including my card statement and my payment proof. I didn’t send them “the right thing the first time”, so I went through it all again, called them and got the form sent to me again. After submitting, it said I’d hear back in 48hrs. Well it’s been nearly a week, and I’m in the cycle where I’d normally call again, but I’m obviously not paying another cent to call them and them waste my time and money. 

Can anyone who has struggled before me give me advice on how to call them for free from the US?🥺 

Also, bonus question b/c i genuinely cannot understand how they are so incompetent.. why can’t they just search in their records that I’ve paid, it’s been cancelled by the property and not by me, and that I still haven’t been refunded? Like… that seems like info that shouldn’t be that hard for them to pull up booking info on their own gd website?! 

Ugh I’m so frustrated, I will NEVER use them again. I’ve been waiting to get my refund to delete my account and be completely rid of them. 
ATP, I’m thinking of reporting it as credit card fraud. I’ve never done that before but does this qualify as credit card fraud?

I booked a house on booking.com a long time ago for this week in Queenstown. The location on the booking.com map was 300m from the city centre, however I put the address in google maps today and turns out it’s a 48 minute walk from the city centre rather than a 5 minute walk. Now that it is so late, there are no more houses close to the city center apart from 2x in the $30k range when we paid 8k (We were also looking at booking a bigger place 30min from the city center for $5k at the time however valued the “location” of this place more). 

After calling booking.com, they said they need to confirm with the host the address even though you can see it on satellite view on google maps. They said it will take 24-48 hrs which we don’t have, as we need to book a place now with the minimal Airbnbs available. When told this, they stated, “don’t worry booking.com will look after you”. This makes me very sceptical considering all the houses are already booked out.

travel,NEVER book with Kiwi.com,"The refund policy is a bit of a scam.

The design of the site tricks you into accepting the new booking price. Modal pop-ups ask if you want to ""continue,"" with a bright, very visible button. As you click ""continue,"" thinking you're going to review the new price breakdown, they process your payment. It's a clever UX strategy to make you accept the new price and checkout quickly.

I canceled the flight immediately (within 30 seconds) before the booking confirmation was even provided to me. Kiwi's, most flight refunds are subject to company ""credit"" based refunds, meaning you have to book with them directly to use the credit. They refuse to refund back to the credit card company due to the fees the company incurs (consider the scale). In most instances, if it's a small credit, it's fine, but for a substantial amount, they won't budge. BE CAREFUL when booking—it's better to book directly with the airline.

If we all collectively stop supporting these companies, they will cease to exist.

I booked a Canada -> US flight with Westjet through Google Flights, and I was redirected to travelgo.com even though the banner says ly.com. Making the reservation and paying for it are two separate actions so if you get sketched out after the reservation part you haven't paid yet so it'll cancel on its own.

After reserving, I received an email from support@om.ly.com with a temporary password to set up my account. After doing that and paying, I received an email from support@newsletter.ly.com with the booking information with a Flight Reservation Form that contains my order number, flights, passenger details, and some policy stuff. Note: at this point they will have charged your card but the flights are not yet booked.

* E-ticket number

I was able to verify my itinerary on the Westjet website and all the details are correct although my name is formatted in a pretty janky way that apparently is common for travel agent bookings.

So overall they are legit despite the sketchiness and you have to weigh the savings against giving your data to China and whether you will need customer support for your flight. If you're in a rush or need to book for multiple people it's probably best to go direct or at least with a more reliable service but if you're a solo traveler planning weeks or months ahead then I can see this being worth it.

travel,Booking.com Scammed Me Out of $500 – Avoid Them at All Costs!,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my recent frustrating experience with Booking.com to warn others and hopefully get some advice on what to do next. This company scammed me out of $500, and their customer service has been atrocious.

I made a car rental reservation through Booking.com with a pickup time at noon on August 4th. When I arrived at the rental place, I couldn't retrieve the car because there was an inconsistency in my booking information. Instead of my correct name, the reservation listed my last name twice. This mistake prevented me from getting the car.

The rental agency informed me that if the issue wasn't resolved within two hours, my reservation would be canceled. They mentioned that Booking.com would need to reactivate the reservation if it got canceled.

I later found out that Booking.com outsources car rentals to Rentalcars.com, a company with a terrible reputation. This was the first red flag, as their customer service is known to be unreliable.

I immediately called Booking.com support, explained the situation, and provided the additional documentation they requested to prove my identity. I was assured that the issue would be addressed promptly.

Despite providing all the necessary information, I waited for hours without any resolution. By the time I received a response, it was almost 10 PM — 10 hours past my booking pickup time and about 9 hours since my initial call to support. It's completely unreasonable to expect anyone to wait this long for assistance.

Given the lack of timely support, I had to make other arrangements for transportation, which was both inconvenient and costly.

I reached out again, requesting a cancellation and a full refund. Given that this issue was not my fault and the support experience was terrible, I believe this is the least they could do to make things right. The email support from Rentalcars.com sent me in a loop, with different agents sending templated responses that essentially ignored my previous emails and never furthered my inquiry. This added to the frustration and made it clear that they were not interested in resolving my issue.

This isn't the first time I've had problems with Booking.com. While their support staff is generally courteous, the company's policies and communication have consistently been ineffective.

In the end, Booking.com scammed me out of $500. This experience has been a nightmare, and I strongly discourage anyone from using their services.

Has anyone else experienced similar issues with Booking.com? How did you resolve it? Any tips on how to get a quicker response or escalate the matter? I'm seriously considering never using their services again and warning my friends and family to do the same.

  
**TL;DR:**  
Booking.com messed up my car rental reservation, causing me to miss my pickup and lose $500. Their customer service was slow and unhelpful, and they use dark UX patterns to make getting support difficult.

travel,Booking.com Refund Nightmare,"Hi all, looking for abit of advice of what my options are.

I've booked to stop near Disneyland Paris at the beginning of December, we used a private host through [booking.com](https://booking.com). It was a relatively new host with only a few reviews but they was all 10 rated and thought nothing else of it. Paid in full non refundable cancellation.

Checked my messages through [booking.com](https://booking.com) the other day and the host is wanting £500 refundable deposit or he is refusing to give the keys over. There is no mention of any refundable deposit anywhere on the page and the link goes to an external site. Now i wouldn't mind paying a deposit but after digging and also [booking.com](https://booking.com) confirming he is not allowed to request that unless its on his original page, which it isn't. In the past 3 months he's had bad after bad reviews from disgruntled people saying he's refused to give keys and left them stranded due to nonpayment, charged them for broken items already in the apartment and taking withdrawls from the funds without permission.

For the past week I've rang up [booking.com](https://booking.com) everynight trying to get them to refund me due to misrepresentation and frankley i don't want the hassle of dealing with this guy when we get there. Everytime I get ""we have sent the host a message to refund the room and waive the fee"" if he doesn't respond in 24 hours we ourselfs will refund you'. Follow up the next day I now get told that it's not the policy for themselves to refund and they will send the owner a message, to then the next day saying they will refund us. It's been like this for the past week.

I'm at my whits end. Yes i know the room is non refundable, but im trying to get ahead of this shitshow of what is going to happen when we turn up and he won't allow us access due to no deposit being paid. I've planned this trip for 3 other people and would feel personable responsible if it didn't work out due to this problem.

I paid with credit card, can i get a charge back through breach of contract or misleading us (due to it not being stated before we purchased ). What are my options here?

Based in the UK- Destination is in France.

Thanks In Advance for any help!

travel,Booking.com customer service nightmare,"I have used [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) many times and have generally been happy with them. However, that was when things went as planned. I recently had a few hiccups with reservations and have found that customer service at [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) is virtually nonexistent.

I was recently travelling on the interstate and needed a hotel. I used the [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) app and found a decent hotel 30 miles from me. I made the reservation for a single room with two beds and proceeded to the hotel. When I arrived at the hotel I was told that they were sold out of rooms with two beds. They offered me a room with a single king bed, but there were three of us in my party and that would not work. I asked if they had a rollaway bed or other option for an additional sleeping space, but they had nothing available. The clerk at the hotel cancelled my reservation and I left. 

I used the [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) app to find another hotel in the area and booked another room. When I arrived at the next hotel I was told that they did not have my reservation. I showed them the confirmation number in the app, but they still did not have my reservation. They rebooted their system and it still was not there. They confirmed that I was at the correct hotel and that they did have a room available. It was now well after midnight and we just wanted to go to bed. I paid the hotel directly for a room and stayed the night.

When I got to my room I used the chat feature on the [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) website to let them know what happened with the two rooms. I was told that customer service would contact me within 24 hours. I continued to contact them every day for the next four days. Each time I was told that someone would contact me within the next 24 hours. I attempted to call them and the message told me that they were aware of my messages and that I would have to wait for more than 20 minutes to talk to someone. If they are aware of the issue then why do I have to wait 20 minutes to talk to someone? Why not just reply to my messages?

No one from [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) has ever contacted me. As far as I can tell their customer service is nonexistent or at least noncommunicative. Customer service literally can't get any worse than completely ignoring customer concerns. At this point I do not see any recourse other than disputing the charges with my credit card company.

BEWARE - [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) is all great until there is an issue. If there ever comes a time when you need assistance, my experience tells me you are on your own. [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) does not appear to care at all about supporting customers when they need assistance.",0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1egrsbb/bookingcom_customer_service_nightmare/,2024-07-31 16:39:01,Booking.com

Booked all 3 stars apart from a 4 star that was my treat to myself. I arrived at the hotel and it was 100% a 1 or 2 star, I wouldn’t class it as a 3 star as I’ve been now staying in this country for weeks and I know that 3 stars here are pretty comfortable and nice. I messaged booking.com the day arrived expressing that I believe they had lied about their rating but I would complete my stay as in the city all other hotels in that price range had sold out, they said they would pass on the information. I felt uncomfortable my whole stay and just the principal of paying 4 star prices for a hotel that refused to give me more than 1 pillow, had no lamp or mirror in the room and I found hair that wasn’t mine in the bathroom. Especially feels crap when it was my treat to myself.

Edit: 
When I say nice that also includes facilities and what the hotel has to offer etc. This hotel had virtually no facilities, no food or drink options other than a coffee vending machine and when I asked for things that every single one of my 3 star hotels had offered like it was a normal procedure they said they didn’t offer it and acted like I had asked for something crazy.

travel,Could this be a Booking.com scam?,"Hey there! 

Yesterday morning I had booked a house for one night, as a place in which to rest during the course of a longer car trip. Now, the payment went perfectly fine, as I paid the price that was initially estabilshed by the owner, no subsequent shady confirmation messages popping into my email as I’ve seen numerous people encountering. 

The offer was, I must say, marked as „New on Booking” and it had no commentaries. After paying, I have directly messaged the owner about parking and if the place does grant parking places. They responded after 7 hours, by stating that information and specifying that I should call on arrival. 

The weird thing that bothers me is that I have received an email which is presumably from Booking, in which they say that the payment did not arrive and if I still want to book the place, to respond in the next 24 hours. The email had the number of my reservation, confirmed officialy by the real Booking beforehand and it just looked plainly odd. The parameters of the logo on top seemed visibly out of place, although the adress was noreply@booking.com.

This morning, I have received another email which looked completely different. It was written in english (the first one was in my native language) and it was supposedly a mail notification from Booking app and precisely from their customer service. I opened the app and it was indeed a message from customer service, from their representative that gave their name, who cared to notice me that the place I have booked is not the price I have paid, but in fact the double. At the end, they warned me that I have two hours to respond to this if I want to cancel the reservation for free. 

The booking is still up, it still shows that its active. I am very confused and would really appreciate some help with this from anybody that has more knowledge and experience with Booking.

Many thanks!",0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1eqorf9/could_this_be_a_bookingcom_scam/,2024-08-12 20:42:32,Booking.com

travel,Booking.com Price Match never accepted,"Hi all,

This is the second time I've had this issue now.

I booked a hotel, 3 days later saw the exact same on another site. Word for word, the same. £110 difference.

Called them as their messenger is rubbish and sends one message a time and they decide what messages they want to reply to.

I then phoned, showed her the price, sent her link. She said please convert it the same currency (even though the same price comes anyway), did that. She declined my claim because the price on her side shows differently when it was a customer service agent in the Philippines, and I'm in the UK. I also sent her live screenshots of the price.

I went absolutely insane saying it's a flawed scheme that they never accept, when I book 5 hotels a year with them and spend thousands, they'd rather a customer cancels and books elsewhere for the sake of £110 off. I mentioned that most people's computers show different prices due to cookies, location and history. It's absurd that I showed live screenshots twice to her and she still declined it.

Does anyone know if there's a complaint team, I can't even find that?! I don't want to actually complain about my money, I want to complain on behalf of myself for all customers, to prove that they break their own t&c's, she was trying to catch me out about every tiny thing. I'm willing to make a hefty complaint so that this Price Match Guarantee actually works for future customers. It may do nothing, but it's worth a shot. Last time they declined me for £300 when I had non cancellation for the currency, when you can simply convert the currency at the top of the website.

Bu the way, it’s an apartment in Italy, Europe.

However, it is also good for guests to know if they will be asked for a damage deposit on arrival if this was not specified in the booking?

Is this common? What other benefits do hosts have if they do NOT set up a damage deposit? Do they have any other way to be compensated if the guest breaks something?

travel,Does anyone know what “You'll be charged a prepayment of the total price at any time” mean on booking.com?,"So I booked a hotel for next week a couple of weeks ago and I put in my credit card information. and booking.com stated that the payment was going to be a ‘prepayment’ and that I will be charged a prepayment at any time? I have yet to be charged anything and the trip is for next week. I am concerned that I will get there and the booking will be cancelled by the hotel due to no payment . Has anyone come across this option before?
 
I also tried calling the hotel and they said they see the booking confirmed on their end, but are not sure how the payment will be made due to booking being made through booking.com?. Has anyone come across a situation like this?
 
I have also had no luck in finding a phone number for booking.com? to contact them directly. So I have been at a bit of a loss.

travel,Booking.com refund policy by cancellation is a lie?,"So I booked a flight on this website, and yes the mistake is on my side for booking the wrong month (I was supposed to book in December and not november) so when I realized that I ask them if I can cancel my flight (2 ways). And they tell me that they have no control over that I and should contact the Flight Company directly (Air France in this case). But when I called Air France they tell me straight that because the money is getting in booking(.)com pocket, they have no control over that and I must call booking for a cancellation and work with them instead, and that they normally ""shift blame"" to the airline to dodge the responsibility (yes they said exactly like that, seems to me that they have too much experience on this)  
   
So the refund for cancellation is a BIG LIE and the so called cover protection for the booking is also a scam (Xcover) since I can't get anything out of them? This is the first time I booked something on their site and this will also be the last

(English isn't my first language, apologize for grammatical error)

I booked a ticket to France from Asia since June with [Booking.com](http://Booking.com),my travel date is in early August. 

I booked hotels using this platform before so I thought they are reputable. 

2 weeks ago my schedule changed and I had to reschedule my travel date, I contact the customer service and they said I can't reschedule my flight, but I can cancel the flight and get my partial refund (700 USD minus 100USD fee).

It didn't sounds too bad so I decided to cancel that flight and book another flight with the airline directly. 

After a week I checked the refund status, and it said the request has been sent to the airline and waiting for the refund. But it's been shown like that since they one. 

I started googling and found many recent cases of people who booked their flights on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) and haven't got their money back after 4-5 months or even more. Most of them are pretty recent. 

I wonder if anyone successfully got their flights refund back from this plateform? I am really concern now.",0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1efvl05/anyone_successfully_gets_a_flight_ticket_refund/,2024-07-30 15:00:59,Booking.com
travel,booking.com is a part of scam and they ignore it,"I’m currently in Weligama, Sri Lanka. Yesterday evening (August 17th), I took an overnight bus from Arugam Bay. However, I realized that the bus I took wasn’t actually an overnight bus, and I arrived at my destination around 2-3 am.

While on the bus, after realizing it, at 12:18 am on August 18th, I made a reservation at the Ocean Breeze hotel on booking.com. They confirmed my booking instantly and I felt happy and safe that I’ll have a stay. I even wanted to be sure and texted them since their calls were unanswered. It was then that I discovered the hotel’s advertised latest check-in time was 10 pm. Voila!

Despite my attempts to reach out, the hotel didn’t respond to any of my messages/calls. When I arrived at 3 am, I found the main entrance locked. To add to the ordeal, the monsoon had begun and I was attacked by several stray dogs. I tried contacting 10 other hotels for accommodation, but only Marriott responded. They offered a room for $180, considerably more than my original $50 booking. I sought refuge at an ATM and contacted booking.com for assistance.

Having worked in the tech industry for 15 years, I understand how products should function. I explained to booking.com that they shouldn’t list hotels with passed check-in times. In my case, the hotel’s latest check-in was 10 pm, but my booking was made more than 2 hours later. Despite this, booking.com confirmed my booking and sent a confirmation email shortly thereafter.

Booking.com didn’t provide any assistance, alternative options, compensation, or even help with canceling my previous booking without a fee, before the hotel confirmed it.

Hotel listing websites have a singular purpose: to display available options for users. In my situation, booking.com seemed to have failed in executing their primary purpose of gaining travelers’ trust. Particularly, they should exercise diligence when guiding people to hotels after midnight.

Despite their higher cost, chain hotels like Marriott are typically more prepared to offer support for travelers, even when guests don’t intend to stay. At first, I didn’t ask them to stay on their hotel, but they even offered me to have a shower or refreshing. I hope sharing my experience will assist fellow travelers and remind them to exercise caution when relying on booking.com.

Not long ago, I encountered a similar issue with hotels.com, and they promptly refunded me and advised me to find alternative accommodation, providing me with a two-night complimentary stay. Such should be the expected behavior of booking websites and marketplaces: delivering accurate information and ensuring user safety.",0,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15ugooc/bookingcom_is_a_part_of_scam_and_they_ignore_it/,2023-08-18 10:26:45,Booking.com

Recently, I booked a hotel that had a partner offer, and it's non-refundable. It stated that booking is immediate and confirmation within 2 minutes. After booking, I received a confirmation number and pin, but when I called the hotel to confirm, they said the reservation does not exist. I contacted booking.com, and they informed me that if the reservation does not exist at the time of check-in, only then will they take action to refund me. They will not allow me to contact the partner company, nor will they do it themselves. It's sad because I never had to use customer support with them before, but now I need to find an alternative website for all my bookings. I'm considering booking a separate refundable hotel within 24 hours just as a backup for the next day, and staying in a lower-quality 3-star hotel for the night in case my reservation fails.

travel,Don't trust Booking.com! (There may be scammers)," Today I received an email that seemed like phishing all over. What made me give it the benefit of the doubt was that it came from the official booking (and the email appeared in the app).

 Again, my initial thought was that this was phishing, but it seemed weird that it came from the hotel through booking.  

 So I decided to call the booking customer service. The lady who assisted me said she would check, and when she returned, to my surprise, she confirmed that it was a legitimate message. She mentioned that it was common for hotels to request payment method confirmation, she said she had checked the website and assured me that it was SAFE to enter my PAYMENT METHOD there. 

Nevertheless, I still didn't feel confident, so I decided to call the hotel directly, and they informed me that they hadn't sent any message. Surprise! The hotel had been hacked. 

I find it hard to believe that Booking's support would be so irresponsible as to claim it's safe to enter payment information on a clearly fake website. 

Fun fact: After I got confirmation of the fake phishing website, decided to use the chat and had some friendly conversation with scammers:

When we entered the building and attempted to enter the combination for our room, a guy ran down the stairs and threatened us to leave. I attempted to show him the booking confirmation and explain, but he would not listen and only shouted 'you fcking animals, I am sick of y'all people coming here, there are no bookings, get the f out' etc. He was aggressive and was getting physically closer to which we promptly left He kept shouting at us till he could not see us. I contacted the owner but she told me that she does not know who that was and can't help us. She said we should just get in. We tried again and this time we got inside the room. As soon as we locked it, we could hear him running down again, he was shouting again, banging on our door, proceeded to bang on our window from outside, and turned the power off in the whole building. We felt surrounded and scared so we called the police. The police informed us that he is a tenant in the building, but that it was hard to talk to him. They said others in the building complained too and advised us to move out asap. I texted the owners about the whole situation. Throughout the whole night, he kept running around, smashing the front door and being very loud so I could not get any sleep. In the morning I contacted the [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) customer service and they reassured me that they will do everything to get me a refund, that I should not worry and that it's understandable I am moving out the first thing in the morning. They tried to contact the owners but unsuccessfully. Since then I had many conversations with both the owners and [Booking.com](http://booking.com/) but still no refund. Bokking says they can't force the refund out of them and owners claims I did not give them change to investigate the situation.

I was scared to even walk through the hall to get out of there. and they were not replying or picking up.

travel,PSA: Never use booking.com for a rental car,"T:;DR This mistake cost me $800. Don't make the same mistake I did. Avoid [booking.com](https://booking.com.like) like the plague.

......

I booked a rental car with Alamo, through [booking.com](https://booking.com). 

[Booking.com](https://Booking.com) took full payment up front. A few weeks later, when I arrived at the airport, I was unable to get the car from Alamo. They didn't have the car I booked - which was a 4WD SUV for a ski trip. 

Alamo are wonderful. They were happy to reimburse me. The problem was they didn't receive the money from [booking.com](https://booking.com). And now, weeks later, they still haven't received the money. Alamo tell me that they only get the money once the rental is started. And because the rental was never started, they never got the money.

[Booking.com](https://Booking.com) is holding my money hostage and refuses to release it. I have made 2 phone calls, and both ended up with the customer ""service"" person hanging up on me. The first within 60 seconds of the call starting. Didn't even explain my case. And the second after I explained my situation, and I asked to speak with a manager. Because their default response was go away, the money's gone.

[Booking.com](https://Booking.com) are the absolute worst kind of middle man. They add zero value and will 100% take your money and make it impossible to retrieve. 

I had to make a last minute booking with sixt, who had a 4WD vehicle. Even they were helpful and understanding. But it cost me $800 for the rental.

Lesson is - go directly to the car rental company - they will have a lower price, more generous terms and infinitely better customer service. Booking has the absolute worst service I have ever encountered. Which just adds insult to injury after they stole the original booking fee.

travel,Booking.com disastrous customer support,"Hello all,

I'd like to share a recent experience we had with booking.com, which turned out to be quite an eye-opener.

For the Easter break, we made reservations for accommodations and a rental car through Booking.com in Brazil. Everything seemed fine at first; we've been using the app for a decade, generally pleased with the service, fair pricing, and ample options. However, this time, things took a turn for the worse.

Right from the start, our flight was delayed, forcing us to spend an unexpected night in Lisbon and losing a precious day in Brazil. When we reached out to Booking.com to coordinate with the rental car agency and adjust our reservation for the next day, they were unable to assist. We had no choice but to cancel and rebook, resulting in an additional cost of 300 EU. Not exactly what we had hoped for, but that's the system, or so we thought. 

Where Booking.com truly let us down was with an accommodation we had booked four months in advance. Since it was a non-refundable booking, we paid the full amount back in December. However, upon arrival, there was nobody there to check us in. Throughout the day, we tried reaching the property numerous times, but our calls went unanswered.  We contacted Booking.com customer support, who promised to investigate. After more than thirty minutes, they informed us that they couldn't reach the property owner and advised us to find alternative accommodation. They even assured us that they would cover any price difference. 

Reluctantly, we found a replacement, which, unsurprisingly, was more expensive than our original booking. All seemed resolved until we requested the compensation Booking.com had promised. Their response? The agent who made the promise had erred, and they refused to honor it. Life moves on, but what's clear now is:

1) Accommodations booked through Booking.com can be unreliable.
2) What Booking.com promises holds little weight.

Please bear this in mind when making bookings, and I sincerely hope you never find yourselves in a situation like ours, dealing with such poor customer service.",0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1c7z598/bookingcom_disastrous_customer_support/,2024-04-19 15:05:16,Booking.com

* Had a reservation and went to the property
* They did not have running water, so I couldn't stay there and called booking
* Booking acknowledged that they would try to find another hotel
* They couldn't find an alternative through their partners, but I found one
* ONLY DIFFERENCE - TWICE THE PRICE (HERE IT BECOMES INTERESTING)
* CS tells me that they understand and that they would refund me the total difference and approve when I ask if I shall move forward
* I book the new stay and check in
* I got an email confirming I would get up to 60 EUR (instead of 340 EUR difference)
* I have called CS 2 times, they say they will only refund me 60 as that's what they have as a note in their system

  
The good part, which nobody should need is: I have a video recording of the call where you clearly can listen the CS confirming that I would get the difference back - stating ""We understand there is a huge difference"".

CS is so bad that they only say ""I'm sorry"". Been fighting with them over the phone and sending the video. However, it's not looking good and I don't expect them to give the full difference.

Flight Centre advertised the price at around $4k for two people - which is a really good deal.  So I went through with the booking, entered my credit card number, payment was taken (pending in my account) then the website said they couldn't process the booking.

So now I have $4k locked in a pending state in my bank account for the next week or so.

travel,Question from European: priceline.com > booking.com?,"Family from Germany here planning a 3-week trip to California starting in San Francisco. I found a hotel which would suit us well for a more or less reasonable price on booking.com. Found an offer for the same hotel/room at priceline.com which is 250 Euros cheaper. Priceline operates only in the US/Canada AFAIK so I have no experience with it.

Whatever you think of booking.com, we have never had any problems with reservations or cancelations, but of course we have no experience with offers on priceline.com. 

There are of course dozens of hotel search engines here in Europe, but thought it might be a good idea to search “locally”. I somehow have the feeling that otherwise the one or other “overseas” surcharge is already included.

I booked a flight from Zurich to Amman in September through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) on my credit card and the airline keep screwing around with my flights. The whole trip was going to be 8 days originally...

* First, they changed my return original ***returning*** flight from Amman to Zurich which would've cut my trip by 3 days
   * I called up Royal Jordanian and they can't do anything because I booked through a third-party
   * I call [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) (connects to their partner, GoToGate) and they can't do anything because the airline needs to make changes. I accumulated a $114 in additional phone charges with them...
* So I end up rebooking my outbound flight for a cost of $200 and I'm not mad about it as it gives me 10 days now
   * I need to rearrange my hotel reservations and add one more night for $125. Again, not mad as I have connections in the travel sector there and it'll be worth it in this beautiful country
* 2 weeks pass and Royal Jordanian changed my ***outbound*** flight from Zurich to Amman **BACK TO THE ORIGINAL OUTBOUND DATE.**
   * I now find myself in the exact same situation I was before. The two entities need to speak to each other but I don't know how to connect them and it's really important I get this flight as I'm kind of just planning my damn *proposal to my girlfriend*...
   * [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) say they can't make changes to Royal Jordanian. Royal Jordanian can't do anything without the go-ahead from [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) and neither want to chat.

I'm just livid and I might request a refund for the whole thing and rebook from Milan directly with Royal Jordanian. But what's to say they wouldn't change the flights from here too? Especially seeming as I would save $1,000 and the train cost is okay for me. However, [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) says they would not refund me for the $200 for when I changed the flights the first time.

travel,"Booking.com messed up my flight, advice","So I booked a round trip with [booking.com](https://booking.com). All was well until I got to the checkin counter 2 hours before the flight. When the person at the counter checked for my ticket on the system, they said it was voided and unfortunately didn't have a reason why. They were very gracious and sympathetic to this  situation but unfortunately the flight was sold out and the next available one isn't for a few days, this is a minor setback but nothing too bad yet.

The primary issue is with [booking.com](https://booking.com). Before I called them to see what was going on, I checked my bank statements to see if maybe the payment didn't go through in time (Since this seems to be a reason for voided tickets). But it did. The full amount went through and was taken out of my account. Interestingly enough, there was a partial refund from [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) that wasn't noticed until now. Ever since I booked this flight, no emails were sent about any refund or cancellation by either [booking.com](https://booking.com) or the airlines, so I had no explanation of this, other than my own inference that this was for the outbound voided ticket. I call [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) and the lady confirmed this, and had no exact explanation as to why the ticket was canceled. But now only my outbound ticket is gone, my return ticket is still scheduled with no refund, which won't work out for obvious reasons. The lady simply told me to try calling the airline to see if I can get a refund. I did that but unfortunately, even given this situation their policy is very strict. I call back [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) and only then do I find out what happened.

About 2 weeks ago I called booking simply to ask about the cancellation policy for the flights. I only wanted information (huge stress on ""information""). However, I guess the agent misunderstood and somehow concluded that I wanted to cancel the flight (I absolutely didn't and have no reason to as I was very very very excited for this trip and had nothing pop up that would make me cancel). No cancellation confirmation email or anything pertaining to was sent after, the flight booking still looked available and I still received all emails for the flights as if nothing happened and the flight was still on. It wasn't even until I got home from the airport just now that I received an email regarding that partial refund for the outbound flight.

This most recent [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) agent I spoke to said he'd escalate the situation but I'm partially untrusting that he actually did, I truly hope that I'm wrong though. 

In the meantime, has something similar happened to anybody else or can someone please provide some advice on what to do next? I thank everyone graciously in advance!

travel,Advice with (presumably) overbooked hotel from Booking.com ,"Howdy folks. 

I think my hotel is overbooked and trying to get rid of my reservation. Here's why.

In 3 weeks time I'll be going to Serbia for a concert and booked a room through [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), got the confirmation and everything is great. 

Fast forward to 3 days ago when I got a message through the Booking app that the hotel attempted to charge my card but it got rejected. Fair enough, I generally don't keep more than 50 Euro on my Debit card to avoid unplanned charges. I unblock the funds in both my local currency and Euro, update the card details and send the hotel a message asking them to recharge the card.

The next day I get another card rejected message on the booking app and this is when alarm bells start ringing. I write and call the property again asking about details about what's going on but no answer. I check the prices around town and it seems most of the town is fully booked and remaining rooms are available for 10x the amount I booked the room for and I assume the hotel is attempting to get rid of me and sell it for a better price.

I call the support line at [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) and they check the status of the reservation. Apparently the Hotel hasn't provided any reasoning for the card being declined and they were only supposed to charge me 2 days before my arrival, not 3 weeks before. The lady from [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) assured me that everything is fine and in case I arrive and the hotel refuses to accommodate me they will search for a different room for me and bill the hotel for the difference in price, but with most of the town being already booked I'm concerned I'll be left out to dry or have to pay an exorbitant price to not sleep in my car.

Did they force you to pay for the new room upfront and reimburse you later?**",3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1clglfz/advice_with_presumably_overbooked_hotel_from/,2024-05-06 11:22:42,Booking.com

**For the last few years we've been getting multiple posts a day on American Passport Questions. To help alleviate the amount of posts, and make sure everyone is getting the same information I've created this Megathread.**

___

THE BEST ADVICE IS: 

* APPLY AND RENEW EARLY. 
* ALWAYS CHECK YOUR PASSPORT'S EXPIRATION DATE. 
* PUT YOUR PASSPORT IN A SAFE AND SECURE PLACE WHERE YOU WILL NOT LOSE IT. 
* DO NOT WAIT TO CHECK EXPIRATION OR LOCATION OF PASSPORT THE NIGHT BEFORE. CHECK IT EARLY.

#American Passport Information 

## How to Apply

[All Information can be found here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply.html).

There will be a form to fill out. Information on passport photos. What documents & IDs you'll need, etc.

##Where to Apply

[Then you'll need to see which avenue you'll need to apply at](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/where-to-apply.html). This could be an acceptance facility like a local USPS office, an actual Passport Agency, or via mail (for renewals).

[If you are applying Outside of the US please see this information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/outside-us.html).

NOTE: Many locations still have COVID protocols and do not accept same day or walk ins. 


##Processing Times Within the US
As of October 2023, times have been extended.

[You can find the latest processing times here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html).

Normal processing is around 8-11 weeks.

Expedited processing is around 5-7 weeks. (You also have the option to expedite shipping from the facility, that is an added cost is an additional add-on to Expedited passports.)

Urgent processing within 3 business days. And you can book these appointments starting 2 weeks from your travel date if you've not applied before. If you have you can only call within 5 business days of your travel date. You can only make an appointment by calling 1-877-487-2778 or TDD/TTY 1-888-874-7793.

Life or Death/ Emergency Service is around 72 hours/3 business days, and you can book these appointments starting 2 weeks from your travel date. You can only make an appointment by calling 1-877-487-2778 or TDD/TTY 1-888-874-7793.

NOTE: This timing may not include shipping time. There have been issues in the past of USPS causing delays to and from the processing facilities and those delays are not accounted for in the official processing times.

NOTE: Some facilities may be quicker, others may take longer, the above time is the average. We have had users saying an additional week or two has sometimes been added onto the above processing times at certain facilities so do not assume the stated processing times are accurate. Do not book travel ""to the day"" of when the processing time says they could be done with processing the passport, because again, it does not include shipping times.

NOTE: It can take up to 2 weeks before your status changes to ""In Process"".

**Some people have gotten their recently submitted expedited passports quicker than stated times BUT NOT ALL. Do not plan on being lucky, get your application in early and expedited as needed.**

**Many people are saying that both Normal and Expedited processing is taking weeks longer than the above-listed processing time.**

#Frequently Asked Questions for Applying Within the US

### What is the status of my application?

Check here: https://passportstatus.state.gov/

### They cashed my check, does that mean my passport is coming soon?

No. During covid they have been opening the submitted paperwork and cashing the check first, and then often sitting on the paperwork for up to 2-6 weeks. Them cashing the check doesn't mean they are processing it or that everything is going well. 

Once they start processing it, if they find errors, or your paperwork, IDs, etc aren't in order you may hear from them and be told how to correct the issues.

### Can I get a same day passport.

Not likely during covid since they aren't taking walk in appointments.

### My trip is in a few days and I just realized I don't have my passport/it's lost/it's expired/whatever, HELP WHAT DO I DO?

In all honesty you are pretty much SOL. [It is almost impossible to get the Urgent/Life or Death/Emergency in-person appointments](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/emergencies.html). For these urgent appointments you must call them directly via the phone numbers on the above link. If you are trying to go that route you'll need to look at any location you can realistically get to INCLUDING flying to them. 

Note that many people have faked life or death/emergency reasons so this is making it nearly impossible to get these appointments.

Otherwise you may be better off calling all your pre-booked vacation expenses and see if you have any options to postpone or refund your now-not-happening-trip. 

### Can I switch my application from Regular Processing to Expedited? 

Yes. Expedited service costs an additional $60. If you applied and have not received your passport, you may call the National Passport Information Center at 1-877-487-2778 and receive instructions on how request to expedite your passport. 

NOTE: It can take 20 days to fulfill this request.

NOTE: This is just a request, sometimes it cannot be honored. Regular Passports are processed at a different facility than Expedited ones. So they need to FIND your application paperwork in order to be able to switch the processing. 


### I submitted my passport ages ago but my status hasn't changed/its been WAY past the processing times quoted on the website.

There may be a problem. Try contacting the State Department/Passport Office, or reach out to your state State Representatives. They actually can often help with speeding along passports and fixing issues when they get stuck in the system.

### My ""Status"" on the website says ""Not Available""

It can take up to 2-6 weeks for your status to change to In-Progress.

### How do I find my State Representatives who can assist me?

[This link will help you for your State House Represenative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) or [you can also try your Senator](https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm). Once you are in contact and have asked for help on your passport application you may be asked to fill out a privacy form or other paperwork allowing your representative to work on your behalf. Make sure to follow up quickly to keep the ball rolling.

### Can I buy a flight that shows I'm leaving within 3 business days, get my passport, and then cancel the flight/Can I fake a family emergency? 

No, you'll need to provide proof of your emergency. 

### Can I buy a flight that shows I'm leaving in 2 weeks, book the Urgent in-person appointment that would be within 72 hours of that flight, get my passport, and then cancel the flight? 

Yes, but given that those appointments are still supposed to be for urgent/emergencies and right now those appointments are VERY hard to get even if you have a valid reason.

For those doing these in-person appointment, you'll get your passport within a few hours or a day or two from the appointment. They'll factor in your urgency, what wiggle room you have, and the other needs to figure out what priority yours will be. But you will get it within 72 hours.

### What about using a 3rd Party Rush/Expediting Service/Courier/Expeditor?

DO NOT USE THESE!!!

There is no magical service (other than contacting your state's house of representatives) that can get you your passport quicker than official channels. You are instead paying a shit ton of money for someone else to do any of the above steps and faster processing isn't guaranteed or possible. As well as there are many outright scam companies out there. I would not recommend you give them your personal information. [See the official government info here on why you should not use these](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast/courier-and-expeditor-companies.html).

### I'm an American currently abroad and my passport recently expired. I need to quickly return to USA, can I travel on an expired passport?

Not any longer this ended December 31st, 2021.

## Other Questions

### Can I travel internationally by air without a passport book?

For air travel, the airline won't even let you on your first initial flight if you do not have proper documentation and visas. This is because the airline will be penalized and fined if you are held and deported due to improper documentation/visas. 

A passport card cannot be used for air travel.

### Can I travel internationally by land without a passport?

We frequently get questions on this especially for the USA/Mexico border. Officially no, you actually do need a passport. Unofficially some people have reported getting INTO Mexico without a passport can be easier than coming BACK into the US without a passport.

### Can I travel internationally via a cruise without a passport?

We'd recommend hitting up /r/cruise as it may depend on your specific cruise. Some may not allow you on at all without a passport, others simply won't let you do shore excursions if you don't have a passport.

### I have dual citizenship, can I travel on my other passport instead?

While USA has no exit immigration, so you don't need to show your passport to exit, you are required to enter the USA on your American passport. You cannot use your other citizenship to get a visa to enter America on your other passport. So unless you are going to get your passport abroad at an Embassy/Consulate before you return, get your American passport before you go.


### What is the difference between a Passport Book and a Passport Card?

Card is for Land borders and some sea ports of entry. Think Canada, Mexico, Caribbean, Bermuda. You cannot use it for air travel.

If you plan on doing any air travel within the next 10 years get the passport book.

### Since US Embassies are processing passports faster (less than 6 weeks), how can I send my application there to be processed?

You can't. Embassies only process passports for people in-person and in-country. 

Also, if your travel is soon and you are headed back to the US, you'll be given a limited-use Emergency Passport that can only be used to travel back to the US.

So the ""Why don't I just fly to Mexico on my soon to be expiring passport and apply at the embassy there?"" idea only works if you are in Mexico for 6+ weeks and if you have a current valid passport to even enter Mexico (or insert whatever other US Embassy you were asking about.)

### I've heard about ""6 Month Validity Rule"" what is it and what does it mean?

Some countries require the passport to still be valid 6 months after entry (or exit). This is to ensure you have valid documents to be able to exit the country. Some countries do not have this requirement, some require it to be 3 months, etc.

But the easiest way to think about it is your passport actually expires 6 months early. And so its best to renew it before that time.


### I lost my passport, reported it lost, and now just found the original one, can I travel on it?

No. Once reported lost/stolen its deactivated and cannot be used for travel. You should put a hole through a corner of the passport or otherwise make it clear it cannot be used so you don't accidentally bring it to the airport.

### I lost my passport, but have a photo copy. Am I okay to travel?

NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


### I got part of my order but didn't get my old passport/new passport/passport card/my ID documents?!?

They'll come in separate shipments.


### I forgot my passport was in my maiden name/former name. Can I still use it for travel?

Your ticket must match your passport name. 

Note: There may be issues if your vaccine card/info is in a different name than the passport/ticketed name, but use the COVID Megathread for that question. 


### How can I get flight confirmation/book a flight if I don't have my passport? 

Unless you are booking with a 3rd party agency that charges for every little change, pretty much all airlines allow you to book with nonsense numbers (all 1's) and at a later time update your passport info, or even wait until check in, in-person to do so.

Many people do not have passports when they book flights, or they lose their passport, or their passport expires. They are fully aware that until they check the passport day-of, the information might not be correct or valid.

travel,"Beware of Booking.com ""Partner offers""","Apparently [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/) uses “partners” like [Hotelbeds](https://www.hotelbeds.com/home) for some of its hotels (they don’t specify which hotels). If you make a reservation with one of them, you’re essentially in a gray area where you have no one to turn to when problems arise. 

For example, I should have gotten a [free taxi](https://i.imgur.com/GQ5sWCj.png) ride when I booked, but they refused to provide it because the hotel is provided through a partner. The problem is the user has NO WAY of knowing which hotel is provided by a partner. 

Booking has zero communication with their partners, which means changing anything in the reservation is virtually impossible and will cause you a huge headache.

travel,Fake properties booking.com,"Hi . I'm traveling to Albufeira next month with a few friends . We have all got accomodation sorted , however afterwards found an apartment that could accommodate all of us together(current is a 3/3 split) . It looks generally better , and the location is far better . Our previously booked options are more or less Hotels with a kitchenette whereas this is a proper apartment. My doubt comes down to the fact that it honestly looks too good to be true . The Host has an 8.1 rating and manages numerous properties but there are no reviews at all , and the property is listed on plenty other sites by a new profile with the same name just a considerably less credible account . Oddly the property is managed by "" Roberta"" but the messages from the property through booking. Com are from the "" Albufeira Concierge "" and it lists 3 people , one of which will contact with details days before the booking . I checked the number provided by searching on Whatsapp and it was the same name as the one given with a profile picture that had an Albufeira Concierge background , which honestly screamed scam to me moreso than had the picture been blank . 


Additionally , the photos were mildly low quality but there was 30 or more . The only Lens search that showed anything was the bathrooms which are all catalog items anyways so nothing really suspicious there . I've messaged the property and got no response. It also has free cancellation until a week before which kindve seems unusual , considering if it is such an appealing apartment at a decent price , they wouldn't need to offer perks like free cancellation. Its also pay in advance so if it isn't real , we're sleeping on the beach for the week . 

My inkling is that the property is definitely real because the pictures and addresses correlate, but the booking isn't . Im leaning towards sticking with the accomodation we already have . Its cheap and not so cheerful but at least it's definitely real . If anyone has had a similar experience or knows better feel free to let me know .

travel,Booking dot com made me miss my flight.,"Firstly, I know it's better to book direct, but this airline (Nok Air) won't allow people to book from outside Thailand, you have to use third party.

Booking dot com made me miss my flight by spontaneously making a failed booking identical to the one I had actually made, which made me mistakenly believe my original booking had failed.

To summarise, I made a booking at just before midnight and received a booking confirmation email. A few minutes later at exactly 12:01 am the next day, I received another saying that my booking had failed and that I would receive a refund in a few days.

Both emails listed the exact same flights, but what I didn't notice at the time was that these were two separate bookings. The only way I could have known this was to compare the customer reference numbers, but I didn't think to do this because I only made one booking. The cost of the second (failed) booking was also slightly lower than the original, but I didn't notice this at the time.

I assumed, as per the second email, that my booking had failed and subsequently missed my flight.

A few days later, when I called to ask about my refund, I was told that I had missed my flight and wouldn't receive a refund. They said I had made two bookings and the the second had failed due to insufficient funds. This is not true as I definitely only made one booking. Secondly, I had plenty of funds in my account to pay for the second booking if it had actually been charged to my bank account. 

I asked for proof that they had attempted to charge my bank, but was refused. I also asked my bank, but they said they only kept records of successful payments, not failed ones. 

I found out that other people were also unable to book flights with this airline (Nok Air) using third party apps.

I strongly suspect that the second (failed) booking was made due to some kind of software glitch and that it either never attempted to charge my bank, or that it was declined because it used the same transaction ID as the first (successful) booking. However, I can't find a way to prove this.

Do I have any recourse here? any suggestions appreciated.",0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bmi4b0/booking_dot_com_made_me_miss_my_flight/,2024-03-24 11:00:09,Booking.com
travel,Tips to avoid new kind of scam from Booking.com,"Hey everyone,

I was looking through [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) for rooms in the weekend at Lyon, France for the event Fête des Lumières. Then stumble upon this apartment with these signs:

1. Among the 200->400€ options are this apartment which cost just 80€.
2. It is marked by [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) as New Property Deal, and have really high external reviews.
3. It has only one options for multiple guests (4 to 10 guests). Normally what you would see is multiple rooms for multiple guests.

My instinct told me this is too good to be true. So I seek the truth...

1. I search the image of the apartment, found out it is also on Airbnb.
2. On Airbnb, the host has the same score on like on Booking.com
3. Interestingly, their rooms availability are not the same as on [Booking.com](https://Booking.com)  and prices are 80€.

So I contacted the Airbnb host, within an hour, they confirm the apartment on [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) are not from them and ask me to report it.

Case solved.

travel,My Booking.com account got deactivated without explanation and all upcoming bookings cancelled,"Hello!

Sharing my story here in case this has happened to other people as well and maybe someone can offer advice. 

I have been an avid user of [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) for years and have gotten Genius Level 3 (used it primarly for hotel reservations and sometimes airport pickups). In fact, I have just come back from a work trip in India where I have booked 3 accommodations through the platform without issues. After that trip, I have booked 2 more hotels for an upcoming vacation in September. 

Fast forward to last week, I opened the app only to find out my account has been logged out. Upon logging in, a message popped up saying my account was disabled for security reasons (photo for reference). I tried logging in a different device but got the same answer. This came as a surprise as I don't think I've done anything suspicious in my account that would warrant deactivation. I've always settled payments with the hotels, barely cancelled reservations, and always used the same cards. 

https://preview.redd.it/g5o4wyn7p1ib1.jpg?width=1135&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ef4c325f34233649f3b209da3b420dfedb567481

By clicking a link on a previous booking, I was able to email customer service. I only got this response: 

""In regards to your concern, upon checking, your bookings details are no longer valid based on your booking history. There may be something in your booking history or in the details you’ve previously entered which has prompted an invalidation. I’m afraid that due to the sensitivity of the information, I cannot elaborate any further.""

So not only is my upcoming bookings suddenly cancelled but all my rewards and Travel credits have gone down the drain as it looks like I won't be able to get my account back. It's a shame because I loved using [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) and never had an issue with them in the years I've used it and I've used it extensively in atleast 4 continents. It is disheartening to know that my account can suddenly be deactivated like that without notice or explanation. Good thing I was able to contact the hotels directly for my September trip and got my reservations reinstated. 

Moving forward, I know booking directly with hotels is always the best but I like the rewards system and convenience of [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) where all my hotels are in one place. May I ask for recommendations? I saw that Expedia and [Hotels.com](https://Hotels.com) are also good candidates. 

Thanks everyone and safe travels!

- Spent literal hours on the phone with Airbnb support during our vacation time. 
- As of today the final outcome is HALF of a refund, and I still have random support people calling me despite the case being closed. 

We were left stranded in the streets of a foreign city at 2am. We had PHOTO EVIDENCE. We had the initial support person who told us to book elsewhere. We had a support person on a recorded call TELL US NOT TO STAY AT THE PROPERTY due to the hostile host and for our safety. What else do you need for a FULL REFUND? 

Honestly the worst experience I’ve ever had with Airbnb. Their business model has changed significantly!!! Please be very careful!! Support stated we could have had a full refund IF the host had a policy of full refunds… so if you are going to use AirBnb, only look at properties with full refunds available.

travel,Why I will never use Airbnb anymore and you shouldn't too.,"I won't write long and just be brief about the whole Airbnb experience over the last 1-2 years. I enjoyed using Airbnb for more than 7 years, and now it has come to a point that I will never use it. In the beginning, Airbnb was more organic and personal experience where you could actually enjoy staying in the hosts' place. 

&#x200B;

1) However, now the airbnb is filled with hosts that are just in it for the business and doesn't deliver the adequate service or experience that it used to be. Most of the places aren't well equipped or are vacant, and most of the places are just vacant housing that has not been rented out yet. 

2) And whenever face this kind of issue, the host doesn't take any responsibility. And when you reach out to Airbnb about this issue, their attitude before was ""let me see how I can help you"" to now ""too bad. we can't do anything about it."" or ""we will try to help you out, and see the solution"" and no answer.

3) Prices are way overpriced compared to the price index of the countries I have visited. For example, when I visited Ukraine, Peru, Colombia, and Spain, the daily rent prices were about 5-6x rate of the monthly rent price rate. Which I think it way too overpriced.

&#x200B;

Personally, I have been using Airbnb while I traveled in the past 1.5 years, traveling to about 6 countries: Ukraine, Portugal, United States, Spain, Colombia, and Peru. I had multiple experiences where I checked into the listing that looked a lot different from the photo and doesn't have even a basic amenities, like hot shower, wifi, electronics. I had an experience where I checked into the listing that the host said it's a ""bit"" noisy, but the noise pollution was too extreme to the point that I felt like I was sleeping on a highway street, because the wall has an open air. I messaged host about this, and he ignored my messages. I contacted Airbnb support, and was on the phone line for hours trying to deliver my struggle of insomnia due to noise pollution and that I couldn't sleep for 2 days, and had to check out early from the listing. I think I lost about $400\~ already from the listings that didn't have amenities it described, or even fails to deliver the basic needs of what it can be actually called an ""housing service""

Anyways, the Airbnb support really doesn't care or help the customer, at least based on my experience. I don't know what your experience is. But Airbnb is now filled with hosts that deliver the services or amenity with really poor quality listing, mostly the properties that has not been rented out, for extremely high price.

If you guys could give me alternatives to Airbnb I would appreciate it. I'm sick of this money grabbing host and tech company that doesn't care about customer.

Edit: some people keep saying do the diligence of reading reviews and research, and I do research listings 3-4 hours before I make a booking, and all the bad experiences happened in listings with over 4 stars. And I left 1 star reviews and it would never show up on the listing after few weeks. So there is really a loophole where host controls the review somehow that I do not know about (report to Airbnb for removal, etc)",2226,743,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/rl8wuy/why_i_will_never_use_airbnb_anymore_and_you/,2021-12-21 07:09:50,Vrbo

Crowdstrike happened Friday. We were good to go on our Sat flight and then it cancelled at the last minute while we were lining up to board. No other flight options worked for UAL (or anyone else) to get us to our destination until Monday (about 48 hours after our original flight), one day before we were scheduled to return. We cancelled the flights rather than accepting a rebooking and were correctly refunded our airline tickets. We bagged the entire trip as it wasn't worth heading out for just one day and then returning the next.

Is there ANY travel insurance and add-ons I could have bought ahead of time that would have refunded us the VRBO we rented? I can't seem to find anything as any 'cancel for any reason' add-ons seem to have a 48-72 hour cut off before departure day.

travel,I just learned about a Vrbo policy that will keep me from using them ever again.,"We recently booked a vacation rental through Vrbo for 12 days. Unfortunately, the place was terrible. Doesn’t matter why, but we felt it was grossly misrepresented. Vrbo told us it was between us and the owner, so we tried to reconcile. Owner told us we could get a refund if we canceled and they were able to rent it out again before the end of our trip.

We knew that would never happen, so we tried to stick it out; it got to us though, and we finally decided to go somewhere else, eat the cost, and be happy on our vacation for once. Out of politeness, we informed the owner that we were checking out early. They said no problem, go ahead and cancel it.

Well… it turns out, when you cancel a stay—even after you have started staying there—*you can no longer review the unit*. I had no idea this was the case; we got played hard by the owner. We figured it would be doing them a favor so they could clean it up and rent it again, but we had no idea just how big of a favor it would be.

I don’t know how often something like this might happen, but it does make me question Vrbo’s review system. This place had one 5-star review. Have there been others who rented this place who fell for the same thing? To me, this is a misguided policy that can be a major loophole for owners.

travel,Alternatives to AirBnb and Vrbo?,"I had a couple of bad experiences with Airbnb between 2019 and 2020 where I lost not only a lot of money but a huge amount of time trying to address the issues and just tearing my hair out with their terrible ""customer service"", and I decided I was done with them. I did also have some good experiences but the gamble and the time/money lost on the bad ones didn't make it worth it. However, I did still have a small credit that sat in my account and so this year, as I was planning some travel, I booked a place thinking ""Eh, what the hell, it looks nice"". Still haven't gone to that place yet, still crossing my fingers. 

Then this week I needed to vacate my apartment for a few days and thought it would be a nice opportunity to go for a retreat of sorts. I booked a place that seemed nice, and now that I'm here I'm realizing it's not at all a good fit and very overpriced for what it is. The ""bad fit"" aspect is partially my fault - I should have been more diligent with the research as I thought I'd be within walking distance of hiking trails and I'm not, so I'm just stuck sitting and working in the garden when I had planned on hiking. But the garden is also not quiet, lots of neighbors working, dogs barking etc, which of course the host can do nothing about, but I feel like someone could have mentioned this in the reviews. 

And that brings me to what makes Airbnb suck: the overpricing, the misrepresentation, and how difficult it is to leave an honest review. Now that I'm here, seeing how the room is, what features are available, how incredibly uncomfortable the mattress is (she probably bought this thing in the 60s), I'm realizing that for the same price it would have been far more worth it to get a nice hotel room. But the truth is that I don't want to say these things in a review because the host is a very sweet, welcoming older lady. And this is probably why reviews are so completely unreliable, and this is very much part of the business model. You're paying more than hotel prices (in my case) but you feel like a guest and have to be as gracious and diplomatic as one, and Airbnb understands the psychology of this.

I've never used Vrbo before but read on here that they have issues as well. I'm now looking to just use booking and rely on hotels/hostels etc, and did a recent trip where that worked out great.

So, I'm considering booking a second villa through VRBO for the same dates (different property owner). While it's my second choice, it has 100% cancellation until June 3. That way, if we don't know yet by May 21, we can cancel the first and still have the second booking and not lose any money.

Am I violating the terms of VRBO or is there any chance both of my reservations will be cancelled? I read the T&Cs and don't see anything related to this use case.

Contacted the property owner tonight and asked how long it would take for the security deposit ($500) to come back to me after I check out. She responded that, if the house was left in good condition, she just wouldn't cash the check. I can kind of see how it makes sense (since it saves her having to cut me a check for the $500 after my stay if I were to pay that amount via VRBO), but I also feel it's a little strange to give her a check for $500 that she says she won't cash. Also, and this is worst case stuff, and not that I'll do any damage to the place, but what if the damages were less than $500? I'd have to track her down for some itemized receipt?

It's listed as ""pending"" so maybe it's just there to verify that I had room on my credit card. I hope I don't have to fight this one through my credit card provider.

travel,Airbnb becoming like vrbo,"So, I have loved using Airbnb to find accommodation direct from the owners. This was in stark contrast to vrbo which had two problems:  
1: It doesn't have a functional map search  
2: Working out the final price is almost impossible without making contact with the owner  

Sadly, airbnb is now going the same way with respect to price. You put in the dates you want, the number of people in the group and you then see a lot of properties that fit your requirements. However, when you contact the owner or read the description, the final price for the party you entered is completely different.   

I have contacted Airbnb about this, and their only response is that if the owner advertises a price, then they should honour that price. However, leaving aside the question of how you make an owner honour a price, it appears that there's no sanction on this behaviour to stop it happening.

Is this just me and for now just a problem with non-Western countries where it's considered normal to bargain rather than be given a fixed prices?",2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1rxpsf/airbnb_becoming_like_vrbo/,2013-12-02 20:38:45,Vrbo

travel,Are any online accommodation booking platforms reliable?,"It is starting to sound like none of the major online travel booking platforms, like Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com, etc., can really be relied upon.

I keep hearing horror stories, in this subreddit and elsewhere, of accommodations cancelling at the last minute and the travel platform’s customer service being completely useless and failing to provide any support beyond, at best, refunding the money paid for the accommodation. The usual story seems to be that bookings are made months in advance and then cancelled only days or weeks prior to the trip after comparable accommodations are booked up and prices have increased, so this refund will often be completely insufficient to find comparable alternative accommodation. 

These stories make me extremely nervous as losing your accommodation at the last minute has the potential to really ruin your trip and, if you’ve already paid out for other non-refundable costs like plane tickets or concert tickets, leave you out of pocket hundreds or even thousands of dollars, with essentially no recourse.

This leads me to wonder, are any of these travel platforms actually reliable? If you have an accommodation cancel last minute or other major issue, will any of them actually provide good customer service and help you out in a real way?  

In just the last few days I’ve seen multiple highly upvoted posts in this subreddit complaining about VRBO and Airbnb. In the past I have usually used Booking.com however I’m not convinced they are any better, for example see this high profile story that happened recently in my City: https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.7193442

travel,Southern Italy trip maybe around 10 days - seeking suggestions ,"Wife and I are celebrating a major wedding anniversary next year during the first week of October and we’re eyeing a 7-10 day vacation to southern Italy. 7-10 days because maybe we’d take an additional few days at the end to visit Paris? Paris figures to be colder and rainier than we would ideally like that time of year, though. So maybe we’d do Paris at some other point in the near future. And maybe taking 10 days would be best anyway for southern Italy alone to visit more locations. 

We did a Mediterranean cruise a couple years ago and spent a day each in Rome, Florence, and Naples. Those were cruise excursion tours which move fast so we couldn’t fully appreciate all the locations. But it did it give us a taste, and that sold us on returning for the sort of stay such as the one we’re planning. A walking tour guide in Naples recommended staying a full week at an airbnb/VRBO in Sorrento, so that’s one location we’re strongly considering. 

Anyway we would love to hear what recommendations people have for where to stay. What would your itinerary be? Or what itinerary would you suggest for relative newbies to southern Italy?

I think we’ll most likely use airbnb or VRBO for our accommodations, unless folks have some rave recommendations for hotels or bed-and-breakfasts. 

Would you recommend that we rent a car? Or just try to get around by rail? Uber plus rail?

My husband and I decided to add in another $5k and make it the trip of a lifetime (for us).   If you had two weeks & $10k (airfare included in the $10k) where would you go?  For us, our requirements are....- somewhere we haven't been (We've been to  Canada, Mexico, Hawaii and a good portion of the Caribbean) & about 48 of the US states.- a location with decent'ish weather during March/April (going next year).- preferably not a location that would take more than 24 hrs to get to (from SW USA)

Our travel personalities...-we like to drive and are not afraid of driving on the ""other"" side of the road-prefer vrbo over hotels, but aren't insanely picky.  If the price & location agree, we're happy.-not interested in hostels, but don't need luxury-prefer exploring the country side, but wouldn't mind adding in a city with rich history and culture to explore for a day or two-we're foodies, but not drinkers.  Areas known for their wine have zero appeal to us (or I should say a wine tour has zero appeal)-early 40s and would love a mix of adventure & leisure.  We're both fairly fit and while I don't want to climb a mountain, I also don't want to be laying on a beach/at a spa the entire time.

Currently we're toying with the idea of a week in Ireland (Wild Atlantic Way w/ two home bases for the week) & a week in France (mainly Normandy with 2-3 days in Paris).  We're to the point where we need to start booking and officially planning and I'm starting to feel like we've left out an amazing location.  In the last 20 years I have never taken two consecutive weeks off in a year (sad, I know), so I'd really like to enjoy and make the most of it.

My fiance and I are planning our honeymoon for April 2025 and are hoping to get some advice on which island we should visit. 

We both love to snorkel and are most likely going to dive as well (I have my license but need a refresher course, he will be starting fresh). Currently Roatan, BVI, and Grenada are on our top list. 

We'd like to go somewhere with good food, whether it be caribbean, french, etc. but don't want the tourist fare you find in cruise ship heavy areas. On the cruise ship note - we hope to avoid crowds in general, so we don't want to stay in any big areas with lots of tourists. 

Neither of us are interested in night life beyond a beach bar we can relax and have some drinks at. 

Our dream accommodation would be on or near a secluded beach with good shore snorkeling, private pool would be a bonus but not necessary. Hotel, resort, airbnb/VRBO, we are open to anyting. Hoping to keep this around $5-6k for \~ 10 days (not including air fare), which seems feasible for Roatan but we haven't found any accommodations that stand out to us.

The rep found Terrence's van...a 2010 van...and we drove back to Calgary to get it. Met with terrence. We were only able to spend our sunday with the van and didn't even drive anywhere since we had to drive back to calgary for mass on sunday. We returned the car on monday morning but was in a hurry to catch our plane that we didn't get a chance to take pictures. Terrence did walk around and said everything's good and so we hugged and left..... 30 minutes later...after Terrence did his car wash...he said he saw 4 small paint scratches at the trunk! I had to deposit $500. It is now 2 months later...and I got another supplemental bill of CA$893!!! How can 4 small paint scratch cause over $1k in charges???

travel,Need suggestions for large family vacation in the US that are not camping/national parks,"A little background: My mom is trying to implement an annual family vacation in place of Christmas presents because 1) she has 6 kids and 2 of us are married, and 2) the 2 of us that are married live on opposite sides of the country (Alaska and New York) because our spouses are in the military. She thinks the amount of money she typically spends on everyone for presents each year could translate into a nice vacation instead and it would be a good time for everyone to come ""home"" at least once a year now that everyone is an adult and starting to step out on their own.

This year, we are going to Kansas City, MO the week after Thanksgiving to hit some museums, attractions, and spend a few days at the Great Wolf Lodge. This is the first trip, so it is kind of serving as an experiment to see if this is something our family will actually have a good time before we spend more on a bigger, nicer trip. That being said, she and I are already looking at options for next year because we think everyone is going to have a really awesome time this year. The excitement is showing in our group chat.

The criteria:

* Must accommodate 9 adults and 2 kids under 6
* Must be in the US or accessible without a passport
* Bookable on credit card points is a huge plus
* Cannot be a cruise (3 people have really bad motion sickness)
* Does not have to be around Christmastime, we are open to traveling in late spring through late summer also
* 4-7 nights is ideal
* Drivable within 6 hours of the STL area is a huge plus
* Budget is preferably under $5k for accommodations and flights (I am really good at finding cheap flights and our goal is to book what we can on points to reduce cash costs).

Our ideas so far:

* Disneyworld
* Smoky Mountains (we've been before and enjoyed it)
* Asheville, NC
* New York City
* Washington, D.C.
* National Parks in general
* Denver, CO

Switzerland (5 nights) - staying in Interlaken or a somewhat central transit location for hiking and sight-seeing

It looks like my dates will roughly be June 10th and getting to Barcelona on the 20th, heading home on the 24th. So we have roughly 10 days to work with. 

The cities that are on the table and that I need to narrow down, because it's too many for the amount of time, are Dublin, a small town in Ireland, Belfast, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Paris. Dublin and a small town are required. 

A big reason for this trip is that A. I've never been to these places. B. I had my DNA done and Dublin and Glasgow had the two biggest results for my ancestry. While I have interest in Glasgow, everything I've heard is that Edinburgh should not be missed. 

As for what I want to do, in no particular order, Guinness brewery tour, whiskey tour, spa day, golf, exploring/getting lost, public transit (don't judge me), food tour/s, eating in general, getting a real local feel for every place, smaller hikes/nature.

3 bedroom villa

Pool
Walk to town
Air conditioning

We have tentatively booked a place in Uzes that looks like it will work well for us (many great reviews) but does not have AC. We have found an alternative in St Remy. 

Budget is less than 10,000 euro, preferably more like 7k-8k. 

Questions:
Uzes vs St Remy? 
Other villages we should consider?
Are we overthinking the need for AC? We do have AC at home but haven’t always. If it generally cools down at night then we might be able to make that work. This may sound crazy, but I’ve even considered that we could purchase fans and/or portable AC if needed, is that at all feasible in the area?

travel,Ideas for family vacation in Europe,"Hello everyone,

We are thinking of traveling somewhere for a week or two this summer with 2 kids (age 7 & 10).  We usually try to save some money (and experience shopping and cooking local foods) by getting a place with a kitchen so we don't need to eat out every meal.  I in particular would love to go somewhere a little off the beaten path, ideally with access to water for swimming.  I love visiting European cities but the pressure to see and do everything makes the vacation less relaxing and more stressful.  I'd like to go somewhere and experience the culture of just living there.  Shopping, hanging out in local restaurants, cooking local foods, walking/hiking, experiencing nature, seeing any obscure historical sites that might be there, etc. I know a bit of French but am far from fluent, so ideally locals would have at least a bit of English.  I am willing (and hoping!) to use a language app to learn some of the language of wherever we decide to go.  Some places I have not yet been but would love to go would be Portugal, Greece, Spain, Belgium.  We are also somewhat flexible on dates, although the kids are in school so it would have to probably be July or August.

Also, are vrbo and airbnb the best places to look for short-term rentals in Europe?

With 4 people, plane fare is already pricey.  We'd be flying from the east coast of the US, probably out of NYC.  Does anyone have any suggestions? We are at the brainstorming stage so I am open to ideas.

This is the first time for flying for all but myself and my oldest kid. I have been to Las Vegas before but I was 8 years old and don't remember much to plan off of. 

I know I am at least taking a week off work but I am trying to get 2 weeks, but probably not. So probably flying out on a Saturday and flying back 8 days later on a Sunday. We plan on renting a van for transportation and using VRBO as I have used that the past couple of years and liked it. So a max of 7 days there to do things. 

I estimate the cost of the van, flying, and the VRBO to be around 7,000. We usually don't eat out at all and eat at thr VRBO or bring a lunch with us we pre planned. But that might change because I am use to driving to our destination in which we equip our van with things like a large cooler, tailgate storage, etc. 

Our major sights to see on our list currently.....

grand canyon

Hoover dam

London Bridge


I am someone that likes to go out and explore and not stay at the VRBO all day. So I would like to plan at least one thing per day. 

What other activities for a family of 6 in the vicinity of the grand canyon?

I wasn't sure if we're going to fly in on Pheonix AZ, or Las vegas.....but it might depend on the activities we plan on doing.

travel,Destination ideas for slow traveling family with a toddler and baby,"My partner is pregnant and due in January 2024 with our second child. The country in which we live provides a year of paid maternity leave, so we are looking to spend around five months traveling as a family, from June through December 2024. Because we will have a baby, we plan to travel slow and in more developed countries. 

Europe is especially far from our country, so we plan to spend three months in the Schengen region. After this, we are thinking of spending a bit of time in destinations like Morocco, Israel, Thailand, and Malaysia. We have traveled to much of Western and Eastern Europe, but going back to the same country but to explore new areas is something we'd be happy doing. 

Our budget is around $30,000 USD for the entire trip (about $5,000 for roundtrip flights and $5,000 per month for expenses). We hope to spend 2 weeks to a month in most destinations. Looking at Airbnb and VRBO, many cities in Europe are $150+ per night for an apartment, which gets crazy expensive quickly.

We would like to find places that are easy to get around by foot and public transportation that are either nice and interesting cities or beautiful nature with hiking or beaches. 

**What specific destinations in Europe would you recommend for a family with a toddler and a baby who wants to travel slowly that fit within a $5,000 USD per month total budget (including accommodations, food, etc.)?**

A few ideas we have are Portugal, southern Spain, jumping over to Morocco, France and Italy (not sure which locations). We also have an interest in Scotland, Wales, Denmark, Malta, Cyprus, largely since we have not been to these places. Since some of these latter countries are much more expensive, we are thinking of making shorter trips to these destinations while spending more time in the less expensive destinations. 

For anyone who has traveled with a baby, I'd love to hear any other recommendations you may have with this type of travel. ",1,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/154e1un/destination_ideas_for_slow_traveling_family_with/,2023-07-20 02:10:50,Vrbo

travel,"Deal hunting, unknown destination","TLDR: I'm trying to find a good resource for researching an unknown destination trip to find good deals.

First a bit about me so you can understand where I'm coming from.

I'm a middle-aged married father of two tween girls. I prefer VRBO/AirBNB to traditional hotels because the setup of hotels is not ideal for a family of four, but things like hostels or couch surfing are not an option for me so a hotel is our second choice. We like places where we can venture a bit on our own, generally this means no cruises/all-inclusives and prefer destinations that are walkable and/or have good public transit so that we don't need to spend our entire vacation in a car. We are not professional athletes but we do enjoy hiking and outdoor activities (we're not going to climb Kilimanjaro but we will climb a 4,000 footer that we can do in a day). We like neat experiences more than opulent accommodations, so I'm much more likely to choose sightseeing in a jungle somewhere than a 5-star spa hotel on a beach.

We live in the US and I've been most places I want to go here (Alaska and Yellowstone are probably my 2 remaining must get to destinations in the states). I've also done a fair amount of traveling around Canada and Europe already so would only consider those if I didn't find something exciting elsewhere.

As for other places, I've been to Japan, Korea, Israel, India, Singapore and UAE (Dubai) but none of those were with family or on purely personal time. All of this said, my goal is to get to new places whenever possible, so Ideally when planning something I would prefer to go to South America (Machu Picchu is probably the top place of interest there), Africa (several destinations are interesting here Kenya/Tanzania for safari, Senegal, Morocco, Egypt) and Oceania (Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand are all of big interest) as well parts of Europe and Asia I've never been to.

Now that you know what I'm looking for in general, let me ask my question. I want to start planning a family vacation for next year and since I'm not overly particular about where (and to a lesser extent when) we go, I want to find a great deal. I have used the Google flights tool that allows you to plug in an unknown destination and that is helpful for flights but not necessarily a whole vacation. What are some of the go-to tools that people here use to find vacation deals? Do you work with travel agents or do you have some little known website that is your go to? Open to any and all recommendations as well as suggestions for destinations if you so choose, but mainly interested in the tool(s).

I did look through the FAQ and found links to several apps and websites but did not find an answer to this particular question. If it already exists out there, my apologies for wasting your time, but please point me to the resource.

travel,Loire Valley Day Trip from Paris,"Looking for tips on the best way to plan a day trip from Paris to the Loire Valley for myself, wife, and daughter. I have experience driving in Europe and I lean towards getting a car for the day to give us flexibility to tour the castles and towns at our own pace and make spontaneous stops for photos and meals along the way.

I understand that driving into and out of Paris can be really difficult. My wife is definitely not keen on that. It's also nearly a 3 hour drive to Tours. So I'm thinking of taking the TGV to Tours then rent the car there and drive the valley, stopping at Amboise, Blois, Chambord, possibly other places, then returning.

I noticed that most car rental agencies in France close early, around 6 pm. So, returning the car prior to boarding the train back could be problematic if we are running late. This is another reason why getting a car in Paris and travelling the whole way by car doesn't seem feasible. It would be difficult to park it in Paris for a next-morning return. But even if renting the car in Tours, we might want to take our time and get dinner somewhere. Are after hours drop-offs possible?

I did see online that some travelers take the train only to Chartres then drive from there. It's still over an hour to the Valley. Not sure if this has other advantages and would again need to know if after-hours car drop offs are allowed.

Thanks for any tips/advice!

Edit: I did further research and found that some Sixt rental locations have out-of-hours (after hours) keyboxes for late car drop offs. So it looks like this won’t be an issue. My leading option for this Loire Valley trip would be a train from Montparnasse to St Pierre De Corps station in Tours then driving from there. The TGV ride between those stations is only 1 hr.

Edit 2: I finalized my plan for this, in case anyone is interested:

* Train Montparnasse to Tours (St Pierre Des Corps Station) - 1 hr trip
* Rent car at Sixt near station
* Visit these chateaus: Villandry, Chenonceau, Chambord
* Stop for lunch in Amboise, maybe visit the chateau there or at least see it from the outside
* Vehicle return and train back",6,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/131z435/loire_valley_day_trip_from_paris/,2023-04-28 16:11:28,Vrbo

travel,PSA: Do not use Marriott Homes & Villas,"I posted this in the Marriott sub as well:

I recently booked a stay with Marriott Homes and Villas, and not only was the experience horrible, but Marriott will not do anything to help.  Please be aware that Marriott Bonvoy does not consider this part of their organization and will not help with issues, despite being able to make reservations on their site with their points.  Homes and Villas does not have support over the phone, and is not responsive to emails, so you're basically screwed if there is an issue.

First, the booking process was a nightmare.  I spent many hours over several days trying to book it, but there kept being technical issues with their site.  Also, the value they give on points is horrible, the ratio to dollars is much worse than when booking at a hotel.

When we checked in, the water was off color and smelled terrible.  Someone came the next day to fix it, but we were unable to shower the first day.  They also mentioned the issue being bacteria, so I was unable to drink the water or brush my teeth with it, as my mouth is still healing from dental surgery.

Additionally, we were in an area where there was no cell service and the wifi info they provided was incorrect, so we had to drive half an hour to try and communicate.  When I did get cell service I received a text checking on how things were going.  I replied with some concerns and never heard back.

Other issues here included a loud beeping noise and blankets as thin as sheets, so we didn't get much sleep.  Also, the deadbolt was broken, so that did not feel safe.  Instead of having cable, they had a Roku, but no subscriptions.  Their recommendation was to sign up for a free trial of Youtubetv, which just seems like an unethical business practice.

After returning home, we have tried to contact them with no luck.  Anyone who can help does not have a phone line, and will not respond via email.  Bonvoy does not seem to care that their brand is all over this and reservations are made through their site, they want to pass responsibility on to someone who cannot be reached.  All I wanted was my points back so I could use them at a hotel and try again to have a nice weekend away with my wife, but I guess that is too much to ask.

Basically, this is a perfect example of a company losing interest in customer satisfaction and prioritizing greed.

**I want to sit on the front porch of a farmhouse, in a rocking chair, and knit. I'd like the view to be a prairie or meadow, but otherwise fairly flat and empty for a good ways off.** 

This will likely mean renting an airbnb/vrbo, or finding an inn somewhere, or even a working farm through wwoof. The big things in my head are: rocking chair, knitting, uninterrupted flat view.

The overall look is something [like this](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/farm-house) (but with an actual house), or [this](https://wpcdn.us-midwest-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.mountainliving.com/content/uploads/2023/05/i/w/interiors-ext-copy-1024x683.jpg) (but with an older house), and the building to be a bit older like [this one](https://rehkamplarson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ProgressiveFarmhouse07.jpg).

As a kid, my mom and I would sometimes spend a week or two during the summer at a family friend's farm in rural Maine, and it looked a lot like Wyeth's Christina's World painting. They sold the property when I was in high school, but that (along with my grandmother's love of Little House on the Prairie) are the motivations for this trip.

This person has posted their property on multiple hosting sites and the images only reverse search to his postings. I'm just not aware of what any vrbo/Expedia/airbnb scams might be. Is there any questions we should be asking the host to verify authenticity and how much proof does Expedia and likely sites need to allow owners to post their properties?

travel,Large group - Italy in April,"Planning a multigenerational family reunion for 20 people - half of them kids of various ages - all travelling in from various other countries around the world. 

We will have one week with the idea being basically a hub-and-spoke format where we’re based in a single spot (resort, farmstay…) and largely just hang around but have the option of nearby self drive day trips/activities.. a mix of urban/rural would be good.

Heated pool / sauna would be nice. Cooking classes. Animals. Good restaurants. Historical sites… 

Not luxury end but this is a special occasion so we’re not looking for budget options either necessarily.

Looking at end of March / early April so probably not a beach resort and ideally somewhere within reasonable reach of an international airport. (Some of us will be coming off very long flights!).

We’re an adventurous lot and prefer off the beaten path so not looking to traipse around the usual tourist sites but also don’t want to be in the middle of nowhere or find ourselves too isolated.

Mainly looking for thoughts on a location at this point but if anyone has organised something similar and has a specific agroturismo or resort they’d recommend that would be great too. Or even a travel agent in-country who you’ve found helpful?

Couch was broken, any one just falls on the floor once one sits on it. Our food got rotten because the fridge was not working and so many more. I wrote my review describing what happened and it was removed. When I asked why was that, the agent mentioned that my review was violating the ""internal"" policy. I asked in what sense and how was that, she couldn't explain because it is ""internal.""

These are all very nice homes but with everything we are reading and little ones going are obviously concerned. We've traveled to many countries and understand there are always safety concerns and even those in the US, but the recent uptick in violence and close proximity to specific neighborhoods within a couple miles have us wondering.

Cost-wise, I want this to be special and I'm ok spending some money. I'd like to do no more than $15k for the trip.

travel,How do you choose a budget for your trips?,"*[Real question: is ~$5k+ way too much for a couple to spend for one week in Maui?]*

**TLDR: How do you choose how much to budget for a trip? How much is too much, and how do you decide when it's okay to splurge? If you don't want to read further, general discussion about how to decide on a budget and manage vacation expenses would be great! I welcome any and all feedback regarding my personal situation as posted below.**

My spouse and I (DINKs) recently started making decent money and we've never had a real vacation, and we've had no vacation at all in the past 5 years. We are taking our first trip this fall and he chose Maui. It's to celebrate his 30th birthday and my grad school loans being paid off. Actually it's a trip to commemorate a backlog of celebration-worthy things that we've put on the back burner for a long time.

Obviously that is my attempt to justify the expenses of this trip. I grew up very frugal and the thought of spending this kind of money in one week makes me nervous and guilty. (He's totally comfortable with it, I'm the reluctant one.) We can afford it, it just feels so extravagant and indulgent. 

We plan to do mostly hiking, driving, some beach time, and we wanted to do a couple of excursions which are really driving up the price. We are trying to save money with relatively modest lodging, but even modest lodging in Hawaii is pretty pricey. I could trim about $400 off by foregoing one of the excursions. The only money we've actually spent so far is on airfare.

- Airfare - $1400
- Lodging - Airbnb or VRBO - estimated $1500
- Rental car - estimated $600 (maybe this is high?)
- Excursions - $800 (5 hour snorkel tour, 45 min helicopter tour)
- *Tentative total so far: $4300*

That's before food and other on-island purchases (we aren't big shoppers), and supplies needed for the trip (reef-safe sunscreen, water shoes, a couple UPF shirts, etc). Not sure how much to budget for those things. 

We wanted to take another trip to Spain next spring (our first international trip, 10 days), and I'm told that Spain is pretty affordable as far as Europe goes, so maybe that one will cost less than this one? Honestly I have no idea and it scares me.

No one got back to me and I have now loss $800 as a result of canceling. Every year I keep telling myself not do anything big because you’re going to regret it. Obviously this year was no different. I still wanna plan something nice for my quarter of a century birthday, but I don’t know what to do. I keep going around with ideas of going on vacation, all inclusive resorts etc., but I’m going to make everyone pays their own way so I’m not screwed out of hundreds of dollars again. I have a small list of people that I would like to invite. I’m just asking what would the appropriate price be to ask my friends and family to pay. If we went to an all-inclusive resort and say Mexico or Florida would it be inappropriate to ask to pay few hundred dollars? I understand that not everyone can afford that and it’s not for their birthday so I wouldn’t be offended if they couldn’t come. I would only be offended if they said that they would come and then didn’t upfront their share. Also one of my invitees, my best friend, is a guy. Most of the people I’m inviting are girls. I personally have no issue with staying with him but the other people I’m inviting may be uncomfortable staying in the same room as him so that puts another snag in the plan. I know I have a lot of time to before I have to plan this but I want to be prepared and have some ideas since this is such a big birthday. Any advice?

travel,Help! Having trouble finding locations for big family reunion 1 week,"Alright guys. So my family (immediate, first cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandma) totals out to be around 30 people. Every year we get together for a week at the end of July in the Adirondacks. We play games, go kayaking, white water rafting, tubing, water skiing, etc. Most of us are from the Northeast (specifically Philadelphia & upstate NY), so we don’t have to fly anywhere. 

However… in 2019 after almost 15 years going to this place we outgrew it and decided we needed to look elsewhere. It was just too kid friendly and most of my cousins are teens/in college now. We have considered going back there but they book out over a year in advance and our family has grown in size since then so it’s almost impossible to get a reservation. 

Since then we’ve been struggling to find a place that has enough space for us all, with enough activities in the area. We’ve looked on AirBNB but the number of guests only goes up to 16 (again, there are 30 of us). It wouldn’t be a bad thing to get multiple places to split up but we’d want them to be within walking distance of each other. 

We don’t really like the idea of a resort (it’s also over budget). We would love to be in the Adirondacks again, but it’s not necessary. Just probably has to be in the northeast US so most of us can drive. Ideally we’d stay for a week, too.

travel,Where to go for large family trip near Gulf of Mexico/Caribbean?,"Trying to plan a vacation for a family in early August.  We are 2 families with kids ages 6-10 plus 2 grandparents. Last trip we took was Kauai and we had a great time because it provided us the ease and flexibility for some of us to do different activities that others weren't interested in.  I find it difficult to cater to everyone's interest and physical capabilities, but Hawaii was great for us.  I wouldn't mind doing it again but we want to go somewhere different this time.  

I'm not familiar with areas near the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean, but it sounds like there are places that could suit our needs.  Ideally we'd want a place that has a beach and has a relaxing atmosphere.  It would be nice to have a guest house like airbnb/vrbo style where we're under one roof and can cook, but I also know there are plenty of resorts which I don't mind, but if we're on a resort, I want the flexibility to explore and do activities outside of the resort that would be safe and fun (snorkeling, hiking, experiencing some culture such as eating at local spots, etc.).  We have eliminated Costa Rica and cruises for various reasons that aren't worth mentioning here (although CR sounds super fun and we'll probably go there as just a family of 4 some day).

travel,"Veteran Travelers, HELP!","I am planning a trip to Scandinavia for my husband and I. 

It is cheaper to fly from where we live to NYC and then on to Sweden. While we are in NYC, I plan on having us spend the night and then fly out at 5pm the next day to allow us some time to look around and get some good food. 

My question is: Where TF do I keep our luggage if we have to be checked out of the hotel by noon, but don't fly out until that evening? We are not planning on renting a car in NYC, in favor of public transport. Should I just forgo the hotel and opt for an AirBNB or VRBO so I can pick my own check out time? What is your experience?

travel,Advice for inexperienced traveler finding places to stay while in Italy for 2 weeks on a grad student budget?,"My boyfriend and I will be traveling to Italy in late July-August (unfortunate timing, but it was the only time I had off from my grad program). I have only been to Europe once before through a study abroad program for a week and a half in London, and while I do a lot of traveling by car in the USA I do not have a lot of experience planning long, complicated trips like this. Neither of us speaks Italian but I do speak a decent amount of French (I'm rusty, but planning to brush up. I can read it fine, it's the conversational portion I struggle with). I tried to learn some Italian and it's just too similar to French for me to learn on short notice!

We are flying into Milan and looking at doing mostly hiking/outdoor activities while there, most notably Cinco Terres and Lake Como. The other places we wanted to hit for a day trip or something are Verona and Venice, and then possibly look at some more places to go further south in the Tuscany region. It was recommended to me by a friend who went recently on a similar trip to rent a car if we are planning to do a lot of hiking and exploring the countryside, but this adds a significant cost to the trip.

My main question is: does anyone have any advice for selecting places to stay? I'm having a hard time figuring out what the best option is when faced with downtown/near cities with good public transportation vs saving some money outside of the cities but with the risk of not having as many options for transportation and needing to rent a car. At least for major cities, trains are obviously preferred, but if we stay too far out of the city to save a bit of money on lodging, is that going to make travel way too difficult/expensive?

Also, what are some ways to vet places to stay without ending up somewhere overpriced and touristy, or going too far the other way and ending up in a bad part of town etc? We've been looking mostly at airbnb but I'm not sure if there are other sites/places you recommend looking. I've known some people who stayed at hostels but don't actually know anything about them.

Any other advice for the two of us who are scrambling a bit planning something like this is much appreciated! Trying to keep the trip in the $2-4k range (preferably closer to 2k) after flights (flights are in the $1600-2000 range).",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/uzt5ba/advice_for_inexperienced_traveler_finding_places/,2022-05-28 18:25:26,Vrbo

travel,"3 Month Stay in Italy - Itinerary, Budget, Suggestions","I'm in the midst of a career change- looking to leave an engineering job by the beginning of March and start a coding bootcamp based out of NYC (would be done remotely while I'm in Italy). I'm aware that there's a significant time difference between NYC and Italy but I don't drink so not interested in going to pubs or clubs or nightlife in general. Late afternoons and nights would be spent studying (M-F 9am-8pm, Sat 9am-4:30pm EST). I've always wanted to stay in Italy for an extended period of time and this seems like the perfect opportunity to do so while I'm still young. I've been 4 times - about a week each in Florence, Venice, and Turin, two days in Rome and recently a little over a week in Bologna. I have an intermediate-advanced level of Italian so I can move around fairly comfortably.

My budget for the entire trip would be about 10k-15k, flights included (but can be a little flexible). The big budget expenses like flight and accommodations. I plan to cook fairly regularly but will go out to restaurants semi-regularly and am willing to pay for fun experiences (skydiving, cooking classes, kayaking, etc). Train travel/flights within Italy also factor into the budget.

\-3.5k for rentals

\-2.5k for food

\-1.5k-1.75k for flight(s)/internal travel

I'm debating whether to (1) base myself in one city and make trips out to places I would want to go to or (2) jump around places. As of right now, I only plan to be in Puglia for about a week to 2 weeks and possibly Naples for a couple of days.

(1) The two cities I'm looking at as bases are Florence and Rome and I've been looking at accommodations through AirBnB, SabbaticalHomes, and Vrbo which sit around 800-1200/month, utilities included. Alternatively, I can split my time with Florence as a base for Northern Italy and another city as a base for Southern Italy. I chose Florence for accessibility and convenience reasons but really don't have a need to see the city again, I just really like the city.

(2) Jumping around places- I prefer slower travel to get a feel for the place so I'm not looking to go crazy with jumping around. With a more clearly defined itinerary, I can avoid having to paid rent in a base city while I'm in another place which will help with the budget. Puglia and Naples are the only places ""set"" in stone for now, but I may take some day trips out to cities in Toscana (will book short 1-2 night stays for this). At maximum, I'm thinking 4 major cities as hubs from which I can take short trips should I feel like doing so.

We've done research on all inclusive resorts and that didn't really jibe with us (were more about not being pampered and we don't really wanna do a DR style resort)

In a perfect world, what were looking for is some kind of beachfront (or less than 5 min walk) airbnb/vrbo that is also close to some kind of downtown eating/drinking part of town. We want to just hangout, relax, and be able to partake in some of the culture while also having the freedom to do some cool ""Island excursion"" type stuff. We don't want to be locked down in a resort. 

We plan on going in May and wouldn't want to spend more than $1200-$1300 each all in. So $2600 total would be our cap. 

The island that seemed perfect for this was Plalencia Belize, but it's so expensive/difficult to get to that part of the island (if someone has advice please let me know!). Another option was Curaçao, but the problem with that was the island is so big its hard to get anywhere (from what I read online) and that there isn't much to do! 

So is there an island for us? Or will we have to settle for something?

Im a Philly native and I pretty much havent gone anywhere other than Disney world, New Orleans and the Outer Banks. This trip is super important to me as I'm in the midst of a quarter life crisis and I'm trying to make the absolute best of this trip. We are going during my birth-week from Saturday to Sunday in June 2020.

I plan to rent a Jeep in LA and make my way North up the coast. Heres a few things I consider musts:

• Venice Beach
• Whisky A Go-Go
• LA (vague, I know. But I'll get into how I dont even know what I dont know)
• Malibu
• Santa Barbara (before I fell in love i was planning on going to the University so I feel like I need to at least glance at it)
• Yosemite (I really want to camp, but my boyfriend thinks this might be stressful to try to plan into our trip)
• Napa Valley, mainly for wineries.
• San Fran (I'm obsessed with the Jejune Institute and I want to see the landmarks from the project)

We're pretty big movie and music buffs. We thought about hiking to the Hollywood sign/see the stars but we don't wanna waste too much time on touristy things that aren't really worth it. What are must sees for movie and music lovers alike around L.A. that aren't major tourist traps?

We never really rent hotel rooms and we like the Vrbo/Homeaway type of places to stay. Not really into Air BnBs because as a Philly native, I dont trust strangers around my stuff lol. What are the best neighborhoods to stay at in these towns and where should we avoid?

We don't want to stay in Malibu, but id love to hit the beach or catch some views on our way up the coast. Where are the best views/beach locations?

Should we make the trek out to Yosemite? Obviously its an amazing place to visit, but is it worth it for us to drive 3 hours out of our route and try to hike/camp and then head to Napa the next day? Is there a closer park thats more low key for seeing Redwoods that can better fit into our time frame?

Best places to eat and drink wine in Napa? We plan on getting pretty drunk here because we're huge wine-o's. Where should we stay here?

For other lovers of the Jejune Institute, any recommendations or plan for us to see some of the sights? We definitely want to see the Golden Gate Bridge. We absolutely love any type of Asian cuisine so we definitely have to check out Chinatown. Favorite San Fran Chinatown restaurants? Any other suggestions for must sees while we're here?

Over the last 10 years we’ve spent time in Florida, US, Spanish and British Virgin Islands, The Bahamas and Colorado.

We prefer to get off the beaten path and away from all the people.  Also, tend to do VRBO’s over hotels or resorts.  We have additionally spent a bit of time chartering sailboats and living onboard.  My all time favorite place on the planet right now is Pavones, Costa Rica.  It’s beautiful, way off the beaten path and the surfing keeps us busy.  It’s pretty much my ideal vacation spot.

Should point out, we aren’t very good at just lying around by the beach or pool.  While I’m not totally against it for a day or so, day drinking gets old pretty quick for us.  Need activities to keep us busy.  Our favorites have been snorkeling, sailing, surfing & SUP, diving, rafting and horseback riding.  But we’re up for pretty much anything.  Love to see animals and amazing natural phenomena too.
Live in the Midwest, so wherever we go has to be somewhat accessible to us... don’t want to spend more than a day each way, getting there.

My family and I, consisting of me and my brother (early twenties) and our parents, are looking for somewhere beachy to spend a week over Christmas. 

The problems I am encountering, however, are the physical and monetary restrictions we have. My mother is having surgery on her foot and while she insists she’ll be back to ‘normal’ by then, we all know she won’t be able to hike around Chichén Itzá or strolling along streets for hours. My father, who’s footing the bill, is obviously wary of the price tag on touristy locations and hidden fees at hotels. We’re looking at hopefully spending around $5000 usd on the weeklong trip, with flexibility for great opportunities. 

I’ve been looking into all-inclusive resorts in the Yucatán or Oaxaca areas, where we have the ability to let the parents relax and drink by the pool while my brother and I explore the area or do excursions or what have you, but there are simply so many and I don’t know which are truly all inclusive. 

We’re not opposed to renting out an AirBnB or VRBO, however, the ability to be on the beach, drink in hand, is my parent’s one necessity from the trip. I just don’t know what to do or where to look, as there is SO many places. 

Honestly my biggest hurdle through all this is my tendency to turn towards adventure-like trips when I need to shift focus to a relaxation-priority trip.

travel,Thailand: We hope to travel in November - suggestions?,"My wife and I have two free roundtrip tickets anywhere the airline flies. So we can get as close as Hong Kong before paying for airfare. These are our considerations:

**Length** 1 to 1.5 weeks

**Budget** We've saved some money and plan to save throughout the year. Somewhere around $2,500 - $3,000. We like nice hotels, but we're also familiar w/ AirBnB & VRBO type rentals. Ideally if we can keep it cheap that's ideal but we tend to splurge w/ rare trips like this.

**Climate** From what we've read, early November is a prime time to visit because the temps are cooling and the holiday rates haven't fully kicked in yet. It's possible because of work we may only be approved for vacation mid-summer (July...).

**Interests** My wife's one big agenda is to ride an elephant as long as it's an ethical organization. SCUBA Certified.  Food - we'd like to get one or two dressy/classy restaurants when we want to go for that elegant experience but other than that we can eat anything. We also like adventurous activities that are still safe to participate (we did some paragliding in the islands and we feel lucky we walked away from it). Other than those: beaches, hiking, music, museums, historical sites, local shopping, and anything that embraces and supports the culture. 

**Safety** My wife is a flight attendant and doesn't worry about destination safety as much as myself. Therefore, I tend to be more uptight about traveling in foreign nations. So we want to travel somewhere safe in case we travel off the beaten path. We'd also like to avoid going somewhere where it is easy to get ripped off. 

**Lodging** We would love a place with a private plunge pool/ocean view. Ocean view is ideal but would certainly consider unique mountainous locations. We're not necessarily looking for someone to recommend a hotel as we plan to continue researching. But if someone knows a good region to start looking as a jump off point we would greatly appreciate it. Places recommended to us by friends or through research have included: Pai, Hua Hin, Phetchaburi, and Krabi. 

That's it for now, please let me know if you have questions and we'll be happy to clarify!

Are there similar areas with boardwalks and restaurants/bars, and nightlife right on the beach in Miami Beach or North Beach Miami? If so, does anyone have a range of streets they recommend to stay? 

If the above doesn't pan out, I liked Las Olas Beach area in Fort Lauderdale.  But, I wouldn't mind staying somewhere different this time around.  Does Hollywood have similar areas with a decent night life?

While I'm on topic, I'm looking to stay in a condo or even house, for a month.  Would like a kitchen and solid wifi, so the hotels might not work out.  I've checked vrbo and airbnb, are these the best options or are there any other recommended sites or actual places to stay that's recommended?

travel,"Anniversary weekend up in flames, any ideas?","First off, my heart goes out to everyone affected by the Northern California fires. I planned the perfect trip for my girlfriend and I to Sonoma Valley for our four-year anniversary. I booked flights to San Francisco and luckily found a perfect Airbnb in Santa Rosa. I had our whole itinerary planned and booked complete with reservations for dinner, a wine tour, and a hot air balloon ride. My girlfriend has no idea where we are going. I asked her to take October 20th off work but everything else is a total surprise.  

Unfortunately, due to the devastating wild fires I have decided it would no longer be wise or an appropriate time to visit the area. I’ve canceled our reservations but am now at a total loss for where I should take her and what we should do instead. I’m struggling to overcome my disappointment and find the motivation to plan a whole new trip. Any ideas would be very much appreciated!  

**Location** - I had a destination weekend in mind. We live in Seattle and I was therefore leaning towards someplace on the west coast but am open to anything. I considered simply staying in San Francisco for the weekend but the air quality has me concerned. A location that has easy access to Lyft or Uber would be ideal, as we would like to go out and not have to drive.  

**Length** - October 20th to 22nd. We’ve both already taken Friday the 20th off work and I would hate to have to tell her our surprise weekend is no longer in store.  

**Lodging** - I hope to find another cute Airbnb or Vrbo for us to stay in. My girlfriend loves interior design and a clean well-decorated location means the world to her. The rental could be either a house or condo.  

**Interests** - I hope to surprise her with an activity or two that are on par with wine tasting and a hot air balloon ride. We both like exploring new cities and eating great food. I would love for us to go out for at least one high quality meal. We both enjoy wine and beer so local breweries or wineries would be a plus.  

**Update 1:** Decided to keep our tickets to SFO for convenience. Still looking for a place to stay on the coast south of San Francisco. Thank you so much for everyone's suggestions! I have enough destinations for another ten anniversaries!

**Update 2:** Found a place in Monterey! Still looking for activities on par with the ones I had planned for Sonoma.",5,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/762c7i/anniversary_weekend_up_in_flames_any_ideas/,2017-10-13 04:01:21,Vrbo
travel,"Random question, non specific city to travel to near me for cheap?","I have a completely random question. I like traveling and I use sites like airbnb to find cheap full houses to rent from. But my question is... is there a way to find a ""cheap destination"" thats close to me for a 1-2 day trip. For example I live in the bay area and it's easy to go to airbnb and type in a chosen city and weed through prices and houses to rent. But what if I'm open to ""ANY"" destination around my area and just want to go for a cheap-ish type of stay. Is their a way to find any location around me without specifically putting in an actual city or location?

&#x200B;

I hope the question isn't too confusing, basically I want to find a cheap place I can spend 1-2 days at next week but don't have a particular city in mind. Since I'm in the bay area tons of cities/landmarks are within 3 hours or less of me. I just want to find a way that searches or can tell me prices without having to actually pick a city?

travel,"Not well traveled, but I have the opportunity to go to London with my spouse. I don't know where to start.","We live in Texas (our whole lives). 

We have been on a cruise (boooo, neither of us liked it). We went to Hawaii (this was amazing, but I literally researched Hawaii my whole life, so I knew what I wanted and everything). That's really it, we go camping locally a lot and stuff, but I've not been many places. Especially non-american. 

We have the opportunity to go by ourselves in May. After plane tickets we have about $1500-$2000 to spend. The length of stay would be around 7 nights. 

Our interests are all over the place. I'm a fan of cheap touristy stuff. I want to take a picture in front of everything. My husband likes science and history. We both enjoy food and outdoors. There is seriously nothing that would bore us. 

Questions:
1 Where should we stay? One place the whole week? Hop around different parts of the area every few nights? Could I rent a little condo like on homeaway or vrbo? Or would it be best to get a hotel?

2 Transportation? Do bus passes exist? What is the least costly way for us to get around?

3 Is there a *good* website about finding all the things to do in the area? I like to make itineraries for my trip with a price and time breakdown. I feel like I'm a bit overwhelmed when I search ""things to do in london"". I'd hate to regret not planning ahead better, as this will probably be the only time I'll ever get to go. 

4 How friendly of a place is it? Since I'm from the southern US, I'm used to everyone being friendly and helpful. But, from what others have told me, a lot of other places aren't like that and are rude and unhelpful.

travel,Accommodations for ~1 month anywhere (relatively safe) in the world.,"Looking to live for one month (give or take a few weeks) in a new location every month for a year. I have no particular location in mind. Because it’d be living at these locations for a month and I’d like to have amenities (like a kitchen, access to laundry…), and feel like I’m living in a “home away from home”. Given this, I’d prefer to not be at a hostel, camp site, etc. Explored extended stay hotels, Airbnb and Vrbo. While the apt rental prices are better than hotel, they are still pretty expensive and I’m looking for a way to keep costs limited.


Looked into month-to-month leasing but it’s extremely labor intensive randomly searching individual apt complexes in an area and trying to determine if they do month-to-months. I wish there were a centralized website for this …. Especially since I’m willing to let the price dictate where I travel.


Writing here to get an idea of resources people use to explore long-term stays … and also maybe have alternative ideas I may not have thought of. For example, is there time-share company that has a good diversity of locations for me to choose from? Are there ways/places to look to be a caretaker at a private home? I know there are some programs where you can be housed in exchange for services like farm work, but have no idea how to access resources that offer options like this.


Any guidance on how to keep costs of extended travel down would be much appreciated.

travel,Travel Voltage Converter Recommendations,"Hello r/travel!

I am at a bit of a loss at this point and am running out of time to figure this out, so to Reddit I come!

In about 3 weeks I am to take my very first big international trip (outside of Canada and US) to London, England. My husband and I will be taking a fair amount of electronics (phones, DSLR, laptop, Nintendo Switch, etc), as well as I will be bringing a hair dryer and hair straighter. 

In my hunt for a converter, I am finding it really hard to find one that will support a hair dryer/straighter. I had found one, only to find after reading some questions asked of people on Amazon, that it only supports specific brands of hair styling tools (to which mine are not those brands). It also only had 1 plug avaliable that would convert. The brand of the converter I found was a DOACE C11. 

My tools are fairly old so they don't have the dual voltage thing that new stuff has. Traveling without them really isn't an option as I have crazy hair at the best of times. Gotta be able to tame it lol.

I am also hoping that this one would not only work in the UK, but also Japan as we are planning to go there next year so I'd like to save myself from buying another one just for Japan :P

Any recommendations are appreciated! Basically looking for one that will support the styling tools as well as our newer electronics. And one with either multiple plugs or possibly USB connections.

We would definitely want to enjoy some boating and maybe water activities like kayaking (if doable). Probably looking for somewhere within about a 8-10 hour drive at max.

travel,Looking for an ideal getaway for a group of friends!,"Hey everyone! To cut straight to the chase, myself in a group of friends ranging between 5 to 8 people are looking for an ideal cabin for a weekend, or possibly a four week vacation next summer. We essentially got the idea watching Friday the 13th. We are all in our mid-20s, and looking to go drink, and just get into some damn fun away from work. The ideal location would be within a 2 to 8 Hour Drive from St. Louis Missouri. The closer the better, and we are looking for something large, secluded, and in the woods. We jokingly want to feel like we are being stalked by a serial killer. All jokes aside, we may want to do some outdoor activities such as airsoft. I apologize in advance if this isn’t the place for this question, but would love to either recommendations on a good place to stay (looking into airbnb), or the proper sub Reddit to ask this question. I have spent about 45 minutes on Airbnb in the lake of the Ozark area and have not found anything that really hits the spot. Money is not really an issue, as since there will be a few of us of us more than happy to split the cost. Thanks in advance everyone. 

Ps, things such as a lake, a hot tub, or pool tables are a plus. Also the more rooms the better. There are at least two couples going, so it goes without saying privacy would be ideal.

travel,Our trip to Puerto Rico,"This is a long read, I tried to keep it as short as possible. Happy to answer any questions I can. 

Puerto Rico 

 When our family first talked about going to Puerto Rico we really had no idea what to expect. Amanda had been a few times before we were married but this was a first for Dane and I. 

 We ( well mostly Amanda ) googled every fact she could find. Watched every YouTube, read blogs and talked to friends. 

 One thing became clear very quick. People had strong feelings about the island. Peoples feelings were either that the island is an amazing paradise, or a drug trafficking natural disaster having horror. 

 We even have friends that stopped just short of a full blown intervention to stop us from going. 

 Actually going was still just a conversation. There was no real plan, or dates set. 

 Then over dinner Amanda asked if we should go for fall break? Well, that was 2 weeks away so..... Yup, I’m in!

 The next day we had tickets and a place to stay booked. We didn’t get a car yet because that was my one job, and well, i turned to my computer to do it, there was a page open about Tarpon fishing, I read that. 

 I wonder if you can Tarpon fish from a kayak? Googling that lead to so many rabbit holes. 

Ok so ya I failed that task. But Amanda remembered to book the car the next day. ( my one job was just to remind her, i could never be counted on to actually rent the car)

Two weeks later, and some condoling friends and family we were on our way!

I had no expectations. We have been to Costa Rica, so I expected similar. But the stories of devastation and crime loomed in my head. 

 We got in after dark and got the rental car. Asking the guy at the car place where we could find some food was our first impression of the island, and her people. 
 
With a huge smile he started going into the closest restaurants, what the best food was at each, how to get there, and every other detail you could imagine. 

 This guy was great!

 The restaurant we went to was ok. To be honest it was a little to commercial for us. We wanted local-er, but it was 10:00 pm and we were downtown city. 
 
What the restaurant did have was Puerto Rican’s. Happy, fun and friendly people. I had never seen service as good. 

 It was like going to dinner with family. Every person in the building. The experience was incredible. 

 From there it was time to head to our apt. 

 Our family is boat people. If you know us you understand. The majority of our time is spent in a marina. So for this trip we rented an apartment at Puerto Del Rey. We were still unsure of what it was like there and decided not to VRBO this trip. ( I would highly recommend a vacation rental now )

 At the marina we pulled up to the entrance gates and were greeted by yet another friendly polite local. We got in after normal hours, so he tracked down our room key, and had another guard help with our luggage. (Only one bag each but he insisted) 

 Our first breakfast we just walked down to the restaurant at the marina. 

  So at this point I should talk about one other great decision we made before the trip. We did not plan or schedule any activities. Our plan was just to go with whatever came up. There was some stuff we all wanted to look into and explore, but no itinerary. 

 Dane’s entire mission was to make friends with an iguana to the point it would eat from his hand. 

 Well by the time breakfast was over our waitress had helped him to do just that! Even though she was afraid of them lol. 

 The food was great, the view and the people were the best in the world. This was pretty much the theme of the rest of the trip. 

 One brunch place we found was a roof top cafeteria. The owner explained every ingredient used. Then actually showed us her garden down below where it was grown. Our entire meal came from her yard. 

 She told us the story of hurricane Maria. About how her neighbors came to stop the leaks in her house and make sure she was safe. How she was alone and scared during the storm, but so thankful to her friends and neighbors. 

 Now, this was not the elderly local grandma you might be picturing right now. She was a retired realtor from the states. The neighbors who came to help, and did the work on her house, she had never even met them. People here just care. 

 At another restaurant the staff had memorized the entire menu. That menu was created by a chef who refused to cook with any ingredient not from the island. The food was the best we have ever had! 

 One waiter told us the story of his family selling everything they owned to move from New York and live on the island. How now he is able to enjoy boy-scouts and camping with his son and wife every weekend rather than working 60 hour weeks to rent a tiny NYC apartment. 

 The last mention of a restaurant is one we went to in EL Yunque , The only rainforest in America.  This locally owned business used their generators and food supplies to make sure all of the community surrounding them was well fed. For free. It is just what these amazing people do!

 For our family there was no choice. We knew we had to make this a part of our life. 

 So we went shopping. 

Driving through a community we saw a for sale by owner sign. The owner was pulling in. We stopped to talk and she invited us in. Told us her, and the homes life history and the next day it was done. 

 On a hand shake (and some paperwork) we bought the house. Now this part of the story is still not final. We will be a couple months before it is officially final. But to be honest, we were all in when we sat listening to the stories told by our new people. 

Thanks for reading

travel,Birthday Excursion to Mexico,"I am trying to plan a trip with some friends to celebrate my birthday in mid September.  I've always wanted to see the pyramids that dot the country, and thought that doing so on my 30th birthday would be perfect. My wife, several of my friends, and their significant others, will also be coming along as well. We and our friends currently live in either Oklahoma or Texas. We are currently trying to come to a consensus on whether to travel to a more touristy area such as Cancun, take a cruise, or stay in another location. Some quick facts:

**Length** 5-7 days. Tentatively, around Sept. 14-20th.

**Budget**  I would like to keep it under $3,500/couple, including flights, would be ideal. Less is always better. 

**Interests/Activities**

* Culture: We are all very interested in seeing, and spending a good amount of time around historic sites such as the pyramids. Like I said, I've wanted to see them for YEARS. Museums and other interesting places to see and learn about the culture are a big plus. 
* Outdoors/Adventure: We are pretty adventurous as a group. Fun activities like hikes to beach activities are definitely something that we want to take advantage of, if possible. 
* Food: Access to good food for a reasonable price. We all love Mexican food, and don't have reservations about eating at hole-in-the-walls, etc. A few good restaurants would be nice, but not crucial
* Nightlife: Collectively, we are not big clubbers, but do like the option to be somewhat nearby.

**Other Research/Questions**

* Weather: From everything that I have read, it seems that it will be the mid/end of the rainy season in September, making the weather somewhat hot and humid, which is not really a concern for me. If I am wrong, please let me know.
* Flight/Cruise: I have looked into some of the cruise options to Mexico, and while it does seem a bit more cost effective, a big part of this for me is to spend time being able to see/explore/experience the pyramids. From what I have been able to glean online, time spent at the pyramids would be very limited. Many of the cruise options seem the same. Are there any good cruises that I am overlooking? 
* Hotels vs. Condo/AirBnB: My wife has found some pretty interesting condos/houses on sites such as AirBnB and VRBO, which are attractive since we could share the cost between everyone going. Many of the hotels are all-inclusive. 
* Diez y Seis: The tentative travel dates include Mexico's Independence Day; would this affect our travel plans (ie. businesses/shops closed, etc.)?

I am aware that the current Travel Topic of the Week is on Mexico; however, I did not find answers to the questions that I had as of yet. I am open to other suggestions as well in regards to location, activities, etc. Thanks for your help!",3,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/8sercb/birthday_excursion_to_mexico/,2018-06-20 02:35:16,Vrbo
travel,Considering my very first trip to NYC and I know nothing about the city at all. How can I find a great place to stay?,"I am considering a trip with my Wife to see Billy Joel in mid November. He won't be playing forever, and this could be my last chance to see him live. I've been a HUGE fan all my life.

I like to take my Wife to different cities and have a meal at the ""best"" restaurant in town. We had dinner at City Zen in D.C., Cochon & Coquette in New Orleans, The Herb Farm in Seattle, and Menton in Boston. Now it's New York's turn.

No plans at present to leave the NYC area on this trip. Staying inside the city and not straying into NJ or even New Brighton (unless there is good reason to). We will essentially drop in and cab to the accommodation. After that, there is no plan except the concert. We will be wandering most of the time. I am heavily reliant on my iPhone for info and directions.

I do not know NYC at all. I know the map a little bit (thanks, Google), but my impressions are probably horribly inaccurate as they stem from episodes of Seinfeld, Friends, Louie, and pop culture references. 

Questions:

1) Do I need to stay near Madison Square Garden if I'm there to see the show but I want to do other things that are interesting and fun (but not touristy)?

2) AirBNB? VRBO? Regular hotel? What is nice, but not ""over the top"" in terms of price and convenience?

3) Where is a FANTASTIC, if not the BEST, place to have a VERY good dinner? (I need to keep the bill under $1000 for 2 people, and I need to be able to get a reservation). I don't wear suit, but I'm happy to wear a button up shirt and slacks, no tie. (We typically enjoy Mediterranean or we could go for good local cuisine if it's exceptional). 

4) Where do I go? What do I see? What parts of town will kill me and what parts are perfectly safe? (I really have no idea!)

5) I love pastrami and bagels, and I understand that the best of both are in NYC. Where do I go?

6) I assume I'll be cabbing everywhere, right? If not, what other options are there?

7) Is there great local coffee?

travel,Costa Rica Itinerary - Need's vetting and driving recommendations,"Hi all,

I’m planning a trip to Costa Rica with my wife. We’re interested in going to La Fortuna (Arenal) and Monteverde. In total we’d have 7 full days in CR. Plan was to split our time in half between La Fortuna and Monteverde. We plan to look at AirBNB/VRBO for places to stay.

Our plan is to rent a car and drive. In my research I see a lot of folks recommending getting a 4x4 and have read that the roads around Monteverde are not the greatest. This has led me to some questions.

Car/Driving related questions

* When people say rent a 4x4, are they talking about a RAV4/CRV All Wheel Drive or something like a 4Runner/Fortuner/Jeep Wrangler with high/low range proper 4WD?
* How is the drive between SJO to La Fortuna?
* How is the drive between La Fortuna to Monteverde (I’ve heard a large part of it is unpaved)?
* How is the drive between Monteverde to SJO?
* How easy is gas to find?

&#x200B;

Other Questions

* Should we be concerned safety wise? Any particular do's and don'ts?
* How easy is it to find supplies like water, snacks, food/groceries? Are there a lot of local small convenience stores?
* How easy is food to find? Do both towns have good restaurants or is it a lot of street food type places?

&#x200B;

Itinerary as I’ve planned it, planning to take the trip late august, early september. Anyone have experience with that time of the year? Weather, conditions etc?

**La Fortuna (3 Days)**

* Hike Arenal Volcano and Arenal 1968 trails *- Full Day*
* La Fortuna Waterfall *- Full Day*
* Hot Springs (Tabacon Thermal Resort [https://www.tabacon.com/one-day-pass/](https://www.tabacon.com/one-day-pass/)) *- Full Day*
* Red Frog Coffee Brewers - *Do with Volcano or Waterfall or both*
* Hanging Bridges ([https://www.arenal.net/hanging-bridges](https://www.arenal.net/hanging-bridges)) - *Need more info if its worth it.*
* Lake Area (can be done on 9/4 since we will drive around the whole lake)

**Monteverde (3 Days)**

* La Reserva Bosque Nuboso Santa Elena ([http://www.reservasantaelena.org/](http://www.reservasantaelena.org/)) - *Full Day*
* Monteverde Rain Forest Cloud Reserve hike ([https://cloudforestmonteverde.com/](https://cloudforestmonteverde.com/)) - *Full Day*

travel,Caribbean Honeymoon Recommendations,"I am planning a honeymoon to the Caribbean for the first week of December and the options are overwhelming.

The most convenient flights for us are:

-USVI

-BVI

-Sint Maarten/Anguilla

-Aruba

Our priorities are:

-Beautiful beaches (with swimmable water)

-Privacy (we don’t need to be the only people around, but we’d like to avoid super crowded resorts and beaches)

-good scenery, exploring, and opportunity for a couple excursions (snorkeling, hiking, maybe sailing, etc.)

My fiancé has only ever been to all-inclusives, but she’s willing to branch out. I’ve been looking at Villas on VRBO and there are a lot of options that seem wonderful. However, it is hard to tell if there are good beaches in walking distance. It would be nice if the beach had a bar/restaurant that would allow us to get a drink and head back to our spot on the beach.

While we’d spend a lot of the trip at the beach, we’d want to do a couple excursions. Definitely some snorkeling and possibly some hiking, depending on the island.

Our budget is pretty flexible, but we’d obviously like to be practical. Keeping lodging to <$3k would be nice (7 nights).

I know this is open ended, but we’re open to suggestions! Thanks!

Please let me know if more information would be helpful.",3,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/blti1v/caribbean_honeymoon_recommendations/,2019-05-07 17:27:13,Vrbo
travel,I would love to hear you all's input on my Italy itinerary (9 to 10 nights),"Hello, 

I wanted to post my rough itinerary to Italy and get r/travel's input. This trip is planned for May 2019. For background, my wife and I are Americans in our late 20s. We love art and history and of course,  food. I'm not too worried about day to day specifics yet but more of the framework of the trip. We like to wander and experience local stuff and make friends. Any info on cultural events or the like (soccer games, town holidays, etc) would be appreciated too! 

Day 1) Arrive in Rome amd have day to get the quick hits (my wife has been to Rome several times and feels confident that we can get this done in a day). Then take the train to Florence. 

Day 2-4) Florence. We plan on seeing what a lot of people see and we also plan on a day trip to a smaller town or village outside of Florence like Lucca or San Gimignano.

*this is where I can't decide when to leave Florence for Varenna in Lake Como. Would it be  better to leave Florence what would be a Saturday evening to Varenna or Sunday morning to Varenna?

Day 5-6) Varenna with ferry trip to Bellagio probably but most likely stick to Varenna for the majority. 

Day 7-10) Milan. Besides the obvious historical monuments and museums and stuff I'd really like to attend an AC Milan game. Is that worth it or should I try to attend a game elsewhere?

We would leave on the 10th day back home. We are debating whether or not to add another day. If so, what place would yall spend that extra day?

We plan on staying in hostels, homes (airbnb, vrbo, whatever) or perhaps hotels.  We are easy going and don't need a lot of fancy accommodations. What are you all's opinions on accommodations for each place? Is it not a good plan to use home rental services in Italy?

Thank you so much for you guy's input!",1,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/8g8xib/i_would_love_to_hear_you_alls_input_on_my_italy/,2018-05-01 14:39:15,Vrbo
travel,Spring Trip Ideas,"Hi, I’m writing to ask for ideas for a spring break trip with my family.

We usually take a week-long trip as a family in March. Me, my wife, and kids, 11 and 8. Usually we just want to relax and soak up some sun. We love the beach, and don’t typically take a lot of day trips or activities. In the past we’ve gone to Miami Beach, Sarasota, Florida, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Tulum, that sort of thing. 

We don’t love mega-resorts, and tend to look for smaller properties. Last year in the DR we rented a 2-bedroom condo right on the beach, near restaurants and shops, and it was perfect. 

This year, we have an Au Pair living with us for the year. She’s super flexible, and probably willing to rough it, but the rules are that she has to have a bedroom to herself with a door that locks. I think this rules out a resort, so I’ve been looking at VRBO, AirBnB, etc. 

The practical and economical thing is to rent a condo in Florida somewhere, but that feels a little tame and I’m tempted by some listings I see in Riviera Maya, Costa Rico, Jamaica and so forth. 
	
So… do y’all have some tips for a fun beach vacation? Priorities are: 

Direct flight from NYC
Easy journey from airport to accommodation	
Lots to do nearby (restaurants / shops)
3 bedrooms
Would love to be right on the beach, or within a short walk.

travel,"$3,500 Tropical Vacation for 2: Where and What do we do?","Hey Travel! 

My wife and I have $3,500 to spend on a vacation, and we want to do it sometime between October 2015 - February 2016, for 7-10 days.

We live in Arkansas, and would love to get some tropical life in, preferably out of the states.

She's been to Belize, and we'd like to go where neither of us has been. That being said, here are some things we're looking for:

**1) Safe location.** We'd love a place where we're not totally isolated and 100% stranded, like a random hut on an island that speaks a language that we don't speak.

**2) Not a resort.** Though we want a safe place, we would love our own little cottage or house, where we can make our own meals some of the time. We are okay with being around other tourists, but we don't want a giant building full of rich white people. We also still want to see the nature of where we are, and we don't like how resorts look... They can be so gaudy (or at least that's our opinion).

We've used AirBNB and VRBO before, and loved them.

**3) Sandy beaches, with warm water.** Not huge on rock beaches or lukewarm/cold water.

**4) Snorkeling.** I've been snorkeling before and absolutely loved it, and she really wants to do it.

**5) Exciting Wildlife.** I'm a big animal lover, and do lots of nature video work. Dolphins, sea-turtles, manatees, monkeys, parrots, iguanas, sea lions, otters, etc. I'm a big-time sucker for lots of animals.

**6) Group Adventuring Options.** We love hiking and adventuring. Whether that's taking a boat to an uncharted island, a helicopter or plane to a mountain hike or tour of an island. We love adventuring.

**7) Unique Culture.** This could be found in their unique foods, dancing, or building styles. But we do like dancing and having dancing lessons in another culture would be fun.

**8) English Speaking.** We don't speak any other languages, so we'd be out of luck if we were somewhere where they didn't speak English.

**9) Relatively untouched.** We did our honeymoon in the Smokey Mountains. There's total touristy areas, but then there's also areas that remain untouched. We loved that. We don't expect anything 100% untouched, but we also don't want to be smack dab in the middle of a bunch of tourist advertising.

**10) Just a good, fun time.** We make our own fun, and we're not hard to please. 

I'd say 1-4, 6, and 8 are the most important things. I don't need dolphins or dancing lessons to have a good time, but those are just some wishes.

We're hoping for <12 hours of traveling total, but if the perfect location takes longer, we'll do it.

We're open to Central America, South America, the Caribbean, or anywhere!

The $3,500 is for airfare, lodging, food, activities, souvenirs, and everything. 


We're open to any and all suggestions! Thanks so much for reading, and I look forward to hearing what amazing things you've done and suggestions you have!

travel,"Mid-May trip to Cancun/PDC. Solo, 32/M, American. Budget $1,000 for 3-4 days. Advice on timing for activities.","Hello. I'm planning this trip for either 2 nights/3 days, or 3 nights/4 days from Friday to Sunday or Monday.. I'm planning to stay in PDC, not sure yet if I'll VRBO or get a non-all-inclusive hotel. I'm planning to rent a car. Here's what I wanted to accomplish:

- Spend the first day seeing Cancun/PDC. 

- Cozumel Island Tour with scooters and maybe find an intro scuba class. (roughly how much time should I block off for this?)

- Day in Tulum, see some ruins, and go to Akumal for sea turtles. (should I block off the entire day for this?)

- ATV tour of Cenotes. (is a morning for this enough time, or is this a much shorter experience than I'm thinking?)

- Xenses Amusement Park worth the visit? I'm not sure if going solo will be as much fun.

Should I go for the full 4 days with this itinerary?

Plane tickets look to be around $300. I haven't committed to housing but I'll likely go from $100-$150 a night depending on where I decide to stay. I haven't looked up car rentals but don't expect it to exceed $100 for the duration. 

Budget has some flex but I'm looking to spend up to $1,000. Is that realistic? I'm not a big drinker and won't be spending a ton on alcohol. 

I haven't built out a map of good eats yet, but would love any suggestions!

Anything else obvious that I should make time for? I want to have some relax/beach time along with activities. Maybe I'm packing too much into 3-4 days?

travel,"One week in Yucatan - Review, Tips, Pointers","After reading a bunch of posts here and elsewhere about Yucatan and going on our trip, I wanted to give some feedback to help people's future trips.

**Saturday**

Flew JetBlue from New York to Cancun because we got a good deal. Flight was delayed a few hours, but we got some travel credits, which was much appreciated. The original plan was to pick up a rental car from Hertz at the airport, but due to the flight delay, they were closed when we arrived. However we reserved the car through AmEx, and they helped move the reservation to pickup the next day. So when we landed, we went straight to the hotel through a cab at the airport. We chose the official partner (maybe SuperShuttle? Forgot to document this). The ride seemed expensive for what it was, but was ultimately fine.

We wanted to stay somewhere easy to get to, efficient, clean, and downtown/not in the hotel district, and chose Suites Malecon Cancun. This was a BIG MISTAKE. When we arrived and went into our room, whoever was there previously had smoked in the bathroom and it smelled horribly. Tried to steam/air it out, but only succeeded a little bit. There were stains on the bedspread and lampshade. The air conditioner was difficult to figure out, and ultimately made the room pretty cold. But all this could have been forgiven if the room had sufficient soundproofing. My guess is that the hotel was built in a hurry, and they did a shoddy job. Even though we were on the 14th floor, with the windows closed, metal window gates closed and A/C running, we could still hear the bars across the street. Even worse, there was some kind of fun run event that started before dawn across the street that featured loudspeakers blasting music to get the runners motivated. We could also hear other guests in their rooms talking and when they dropped things on the floor. It was very frustrating not to get any sleep after the delayed flight.


**Sunday**

The next annoying hurdle was Hertz. Even though we reserved a car online, they said since we didn't pre-pay, they didn't have to honor the reservation for the car we wanted. All they had available was a Dodge Grand Caravan. It was much bigger than we needed, and ended up costing us more in gas than a regular car would have. But it drove nicely, and the A/C worked well.

The drive to Merida was mostly uneventful. Took the tollway most of the trip, which was fast and had no traffic. Got stopped on the Yucatan/Quintana Roo border by a federale. He let us go through without hassle (queue foreshadowing music). Stayed in Koox Art 64 Boutique Hotel in El Centro. Generally a nice place with very helpful employees and lovely pool. Room had good A/C, huge TV, cute patio, large closet, safe, comfortable/pillows, and ceiling fan. Downsides were that there was no bathroom door, not great soundproofing (birds, neighboring children), no fridge in room, and it seemed relatively easy for bugs to get in. The room was upstairs, and there was a shared kitchen and living room downstairs.

Checked out Merida en Domingo that day, which was really fun. Traditional dancing, tons of vendors and people around. Had a sopa de lima snack from one of the stands, which was kind of weak. Went for lunch to Manjar Blanco. Very tasty. Tried panuchos, papadzules, and relleno negro. Rest of the day was spent walking around, swimming and checking out thing around town.

For dinner, went to Tikin Xic on the north side of town. Food was good, cheap, and the staff was nice. Great botanas and ceviche. The namesake dish was good too. After, checked out the funk/blues jam at Dzalbay. It was decently fun.

I guess it's at this point that I'll also mention something that seems pretty obvious, and it's that Merida is HOT. Even in February, it was 90s during the day. And a lot of places don't have A/C, probably because most people are used to it.


**Monday**

Lots more walking around and city exploring. Had some breakfast tacos at Taqueria La Lupita. They were excellent. Amazing Cochinita and lechon. So much flavor and fantastic texture.

It's cool that Merida had kind of a heyday in the mid 1800s. Paseo de Montejo has a lot of beautiful, ornate old buildings that look like they should be an embassy or something. Checked out some of the large markets as well, at people's recommendations here. Had a hard time figuring out where the ""best"" places were. The hawkers were kind of aggressive and I wasn't ready for it. Ending up having some Poc Chuc, which was okay but left me wanting. Walked around some more and had some tepache and ice cream, both of which were fine but nothing special.

Walked around more, swam more to beat the heat and rested at the hotel. Had some fish tacos at El Fabuloso Pez. Nice presentation, though the place seemed pretty corporate/cookie cutter. Got a little bit sick from the food. Went to Golden Island Casino after, which was disappointing, as it was almost entirely video slots. 

Took an Uber back to Centro and went to Pipiripau for a drink and it was totally dead. Then went to La Negrita. Bands were playing, people dancing, super fun scene. Had some ceviche, which was uninspiring, but didn't matter. Negrita was great.


**Tuesday**

Day trip to Uxmal for ruins. Walked around a bunch. Lots of tourists around obviously, but it was cool. Didn't pay for a guide or tour or anything. Just wandered. Saw some lizards get into an intense fight. Left to go to Hacienda Mucuyche for lunch and the cenote. Lunch was fine, nothing special. Had some salbutes, chips, water and other snacks. The cenote was done as part of a tour group. Kind of felt Disney-ified, but was super beautiful. Wish we had longer to swim around. Went to cenote Kankirixche after, which was also pretty, but the opposite experience. Instead of a guided tour and guides and stuff, you just gave the guy $30MX for a little laminated card. Then you give the card to the guy by the cenote and he just lets you do your thing. Very different experiences, both fun.

Got stopped again by federales getting back into Yucatan. They seemed perplexed that I didn't speak Spanish and let me go. Had reservations at Nectar for dinner, but wife got super sick either from lunch or accidentally drinking cenote water or something. Had to cancel the reservation. People at the hotel suggested Uber Eats for delivery, and figured why not. Wanted to see what the burrito was like, and ordered one from La Taque. It came on a paper tray, wrapped in plastic, which was weird, but was very tasty. And huge! No rice either, just meat and cheese wrapped up and grilled a bit.


**Wednesday**

Woke up for a taco brunch. Walked to Taqueria Yucatan. Good tacos! Great tortillas! Nice service even though they didn't speak any English, and my Spanish is very limited. The chaya con huevos was excellent. Checked out of hotel and drove to Wayan'e for more tacos. Loved the variety and amazing flavors. I'd read about green chorizo but never eaten it before. Really delicious. Didn't love that they charged me for 6 tacos and only gave me 5, and that the prices on the receipt didn't match the menu. But the food was great, so I wasn't complaining.

Started the drive out of Merida to El Cuyo for some beach time. Stopped by Federales, because of course. I booked with Mattias through VRBO, emailed back and forth a few times to confirm details, including within a week of our scheduled arrival, and everything seemed like it was going to be setup for a nice stay.

Got into El Cuyo, located the Hacienda, knocked on the door, and another guest let us in. They told me I should message Mattias or his assistant Magally via WhatsApp for the keys. So I messaged Magally and she told me that there were no rooms available. I sent her a photo of my confirmation, but she was not apologetic and offered no alternatives. VRBO had only one other place in El Cuyo, Cabanas El Cuyo. It was super bare bones. Wood plank room, bad lighting, sub par bed & pillows, no A/C, bad water pressure, luke warm shower. If there were neighbors, I would have heard everything the did. But Reyes, the guy running it, was nice enough. And it was right on the beach, so the breeze was great and the view was incredible.

Unfortunately, Reyes also suggested getting dinner at Loncheria La Lupita. Got some tacos, gringas and salbutes. I say unfortunately, because maybe it wasn't the cleanest place, because I got really sick from the food. Had a rough night.


**Thursday**

Didn't sleep much that night. Decided that it would be nicer outside than inside and rolled around on a lounger for a few hours. Had some water. Ventured into town for some pancakes at Naia Cafe. Right on cue, more Federales show up. These ones were very interested in me and my passport. Took one of the other diner's passports and didn't seem to give it back. Pancakes were mediocre. Could have used some baking soda. Hung out more on the beach. Weather was mid 80s and beautiful. Maybe only two other people within sight on the beach. Totally chill.

Originally had an idea to get dinner in Tizimin, but after seeing the roads and lack of lighting, changed plans. Got dinner that night at Chile Gordo. It's run by a nice British woman and very cute. Food is central Mexican/Veracruz in style and good. Walked around El Cuyo some more. Kids were preparing for Carnival the next week. Watched them a bit. Star gazed. Had some night beach. Cooled off at night to upper 70s.


**Friday**

Packed up and left El Cuyo. Drove through Yucatan. Got stopped by Federales once again. This guy kept saying there was something wrong with license plates of the rental van. Wouldn't let us go. He said we had to go to Merida for some kind of inspection and similar nonsense. We said we could not do that. Eventually he asked for a bribe. Being that we had to catch a flight, ended up paying and then leaving. He said be careful.

Filled up the van, took it back to Hertz. Still waiting to see if they charge anything extra for damage that doesn't exist. Flight home was thankfully uneventful other than that the Direct TV/movies didn't work.


So that's about it! Tried to be concise, but got long winded. If you have any questions, I can try to help.",10,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/awndps/one_week_in_yucatan_review_tips_pointers/,2019-03-02 22:44:22,Vrbo
travel,Need help settling on a location for a trip to Central America or the Caribbean.,"Hello /r/travel!

Trying to settle on a location for a trip in May and could use some first-hand advice to help with the decision. For some background, I'm taking my parents (54 & 50 years old), and my sister (19 years old) out of the country for the first time. I (25 years old) am a moderately experienced traveler. I've done three solo trips in western and eastern Europe, and the US. 

We are looking to go for 7-9 days from May 18th through the 26th. Our focus has been narrowed down to Central America or Caribbean. Thinking along the lines of Mexico, Belize, Honduras, Barbados, maybe Cuba, etc. Like most here, my preference is to avoid resorts and big tourist areas. I got my family on board to rent our own place through vrbo or Air b&b to save on some cash and make the trip more personal to us. 

In terms of budget we are looking to spend less than $450 on flights per person. This seems reasonable through checking some google flights and kayak. We can fly out of Philadelphia or Baltimore. If there is a big savings we can fly out of JFK. From what I've seen the cheapest flights tend to be to Cozumel and Havana ($275-$300). Midrange are various islands in the Caribbean ($300-$400), and pushing our budget is Belize, Honduras, and other Central America ($400+). For our accommodations we are looking to rent a place hopefully under $125/night. 

This non-negotiable preferences we have for the trip are the following:

- Warm weather

- Beautiful beaches

- Outside of the US (preferably no US or British Virgin Islands)

Interests we have that may help

- Hiking/Jungle treks

- History (I'm thinking Ancient Ruins, Castles, etc.)

- Snorkeling/Scuba

- Kayaking

- Possibly surfing

-  A little bit of nightlife (We don't want a huge party scene like Cancun, but some bars or good restaurants would be welcome)

Concerns of my family

- Safety (I've assured them that if we are smart and do our research we will be fine, but I don't think my parents will be relaxed if they always feel the need to be on guard if their worry is warranted or not)

- Language ( I can communicate with some basic French, and my Spanish is pretty shit, but I could get by. Rest of the family speaks only english)


With this criteria in mind I've narrowed down some our options to the following:

- Caye Caulker, Belize

- Cozumel, Mexico (It's touristy but there seems to be loads to do. Tulum is also an option)

- Havana, Cuba

- South or West coast of Barbados

- Roatan, Honduras

- Turks & Caicos


There just seems to be a wealth of conflicting information on the internet regarding the Caribbean and Central America so I'm feeling a bit perplexed. With all this in mind can anyone point in the right direction if these are some good places to take the family? If there is a place you've been that I haven't mentioned that you absolutely loved I'm open to anything.

We're driving from WI to FL (one overnight along the way).  We're staying in FL for 9 nights across 2 different spots (AirBNB & VRBO).

Just curious if anyone has advice on this sort of trip.  I don't know what could happen that would ruin the trip other than car troubles or someone getting sick so I'm not sure if we need the Trip Insurance or if it'd just be a waste, but I also don't really know what it might cover that normal Health Insurance and Credit Card stuff wouldn't cover.

We'd also be interested in sharing one larger house.  As a group we have done the VRBO thing to rent larger vacations houses.  I didn't know if there were any resorts that have such accommodations for groups to share one space.  The one all-inclusive I did for my Honeymoon 8 years ago was more ""hotel"" style.  2 people, 1 king bed per room.  Also that was through my parents Time-share company, so my dad pretty much hooked us up.  They gave us the options in mexico, we picked one, gave him a check, he made the reservation though their company.

travel,Need ideas for a specific family trip I have in mind,"Hi all! My first time posting here, really hoping you can help!

I'm planning a first vacation for my family and have some specific needs I am trying to fulfill:

We live in Western NY, here is what we're hoping for:

\- Less than a 7 hour drive OR an easy flight (or two connecting) getting us close to the destination

\- A house we can rent on AirBnB, VRBO, etc..

\- On the Ocean or within a block or two

\- Somewhere that has houses where they commonly have their own private pool as well for when we get tired of the ocean/beach and want to chill. Most of what I've been able to find is houses that have a shared common pool in a community or something.

So far the place I've found that fits these needs most commonly is the Outer Banks, just not thrilled to drive 2 hours after flying into Virginia.

travel,Rome to Naples to Ravello,"Hey All! 

We are hoping to get a little advice on Italy! We will be on our honeymoon and was wondering if you guys thought this itinerary is doable. 

Land in Rome for 2 nights. VRBO. Eat and explore the touristy stuff. 

Rail to Naples. 

Rent a small car in Naples and drive to Ravello. 

Is that too much in one day? 

Should we stop in Sorrento for a few days before Ravello? 

We will most likely keep the car for exploring the coast. 

We will be in Italy for a total of 16 nights so we are a bit flexible. We are not big tourist types but do feel we should do a bit of that while there. I'm in it for the meat and cheese!! We prefer the small town feel. We are in our early 30's. The town of Amalfi looks nice and quiet.

travel,Advice on our trip to Porto & Santiago de Compostela,"My wife and I will be in Porto the second week of July so that I can attend a conference. We're going to rent a car for two days and drive to Santiago de Compostela. We've already booked our hotels/VRBO, so the larger itinerary is fixed.

I would appreciate any advice on things to do in and around Porto as well as around Santiago de Compostela and Galicia since we'll have a car during that time. 

**Itinerary:**

Day One: Arrive in Porto in the morning. Relax.

Day Two: Rent car & drive to Santiago de Compostela.

Day Three: Santiago de Compostela. 

Day Four: Drive back to Porto.

Day Five to Seven: Porto (conference)

**Background & Interests**

We're both in our thirties and have traveled in Europe before. We've always traveled by train previously, and renting a car and exploring more remote and less visited villages has been on my bucket list. Visiting Spain has been on hers. We're not big on nightlife but love to drink and eat, especially seafood (I'm pescetarian). We're definitely planning on visiting some beaches in Galicia and would be interested in small day hikes if there were areas around Galicia or Porto worth visiting for that. General interests are architecture, history, museums, outdoors, and we're not afraid of being out of our comfort zone.

**Things we're currently considering**

Around Santiago de Compostela: Visiting Cambados, Combarro, Carnota, Playa de Barra, Paxarinas

Around Porto: We're staying very close to the São Bento metro stop. We've researched the basics: Cafe Majestic, Ponte de D. Luis, Sao Francisco Church, Livraria Lello & Irmao (wife's a Librarian). Possible daytrips: Braga, Guimaraes, Duoro Valley in general. I'll be at the conference through the early afternoon, so any day trips will have to be after lunch. Also, my wife is planning on wandering around and visiting unique shops while I'm at my conference, so any suggestions on shops or good areas in Porto would be appreciated -  as well as any restaurant suggestions. We'll probably plan on one fancy night out. 

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!",6,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/4nwe08/advice_on_our_trip_to_porto_santiago_de_compostela/,2016-06-13 16:21:15,Vrbo
travel,"Planning a Spring trip. Toronto, or Portland, OR?","So I’m getting the itch to get out and visit an unfamiliar city solo, and I’ve narrowed my choices down to Portland, OR and Toronto. But I’m having trouble making up my mind, so I figured I would trust the wisdom of strangers on the Internet. I’m looking to spend between five and seven days on this trip, and looking to travel before June.

My budget is in the range of $500 — $750 for airfare and lodging. I’m leaning towards Airbnb / VRBO over a hotel, as I’ve used these services in the past and have not had a bad experience yet. Once I’m at my destination, I don’t worry too much about how much I spend on food, drink, entertainment, and local transport. I’m not looking to rent a car - one of the reasons these two cities caught my attention is the fact that I’ve heard they’re pedestrian friendly.

As far as my interests, I’m quite passionate about art, beer, coffee, and taking plenty of photos. Toronto has a slight advantage in this category that they’re holding the Toronto Comic Arts Festival (TCAF) on May 14th - 15th. However, eating at Voodoo Donuts in Portland is on my bucket list.

I’m not too concerned about safety because I’m under the impression that either would be a pretty safe trip.

Wanted to get something in Torridon for nights 4/5 but Achnasheen was the closest I could find though I did find this home which perhaps is a better location? Plan was to hike Beinn Alligin one day, and explore more the other day while in Torridon.

I decided to just check into pricing and see what I could find, and was surprised to find that it doesn't seem as expensive as I had anticipated. If you stay outside of big cities, it seems you can find lodging for 100USD or cheaper on VRBO. Flights are not terrible via budget airlines like Norwegian or WOW.

TripAdvisor's system suddenly stopped importing my reservation calendar from Airbnb, which resulted in double booking from TripAdvisor as the calendar shows the entire month of July open, even though it is booked. More importantly, there is no way to reach their live tech support either by phone or thought website--it's an endless loop. On top of that, I cannot create a support ticket as a host, but their system wants to charge me the host $150 if I choose to cancel this double booked reservation, even tough it is clearly due to their technical issues with calendars.

Lastly, there is not way to switch off instant booking on TripAdvisor anymore, which means the hosts will always be responsible for $150?

travel,How can my wife and I find places to stay for a month at a time?,"I love Airbnb and Couchsurfing. They're great for short stays. But I think they're not appropriate for longer stays, up to 30 days. 

I've heard of ""exchange"" programs where students can go and live with a family for a few months at a time. Is there anything similar for travellers who want to spend a bit of time getting to know a place?

I wouldn't mind renting a fully-furnished apartment for a month, but I don't know if it would be possible. But I also think it would be nicer to stay with a family in their guest room, maybe for two weeks at a time.

I want to do some extended travelling (say 6 months through various countries), so don't want to spend all that time in hostels. Hostels would have been great if I was single, but we need a bit of privacy and someplace we can call our temporary home. I would love to travel slowly while I do some remote work (web development), and my wife can do translation work online, too. We just want to get to know the cities and local cultures, and maybe fall in love with some place and decide to move there more permanently.

I'm going to be living in Shymkent, Kazakhstan for the next 2 months. Then we're going to spend a month in Izmir, Turkey with my relatives. After that, I would love to travel through Greece, Italy, Germany, France, England, Ireland, and Scotland.

* 3 nights https://huusgstaad.com/en/   
* 2 nights ideally somewhere more remote, but will fall back to Zermatt Alpenhof (already booked) if can't find it.   

Maybe this is just the way this area is, but it seems like most of this style resort/experience requires a 5+ night stay, I contacted these properties featured in Guardian and one more that I found to see if I could gap fill a few nights, and they said they would let me know in May.

Our day to day is mainly adventure touring alternating with just general relaxing/reading.  We lean to the nicer properties and fund it through /r/churning and do some MS so price is not (much) of a concern.

We are booking our apartments via Airbnb, VRBO or FlipKey (currently have several options in each city).  Beyond lodging, I'll be honest, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed since this is my first time visiting Portugal and the more I research, the more I question my choices.  Looking for expert advice.

Arrival Friday April 8th - Train to Porto, check into our apartment rental, explore with a nice walk, dinner, bed early to overcome jet lag.

PORTO April 9 - April 12: During this time we plan to take a 1 day  tour to Douro Valley for wine tasting. Additionally, we are alotting 2 full days to spend in Porto taking walking tours, site seeing, dining, port caves etc. This leaves us one additional full day and we are considering a) Braga b) Aveira c) Coimbra d) remaining in Porto if 2 days isn't enough or something we haven't considered. This is where I'd love some expert advice.

Train to Lisbon April 13th (morning): Upon arrival head to next apartment and hopefully leave bags or check-in then explore the area and enjoy dinner (possibly Fado Dinner on this night?).

LISBON April 14 -16: During this time period we plan to take a day trip to Sintra, spend another day exploring Lisbon on a guided walking tour, and finally we are considering a) another full day in Lisbon if needed b) a day trip to Cascais OR c) a day trip to Nazare d) another option we haven't considered? Would love advice once again.

April 17 Sunday: Return Home.

Please advise if this seems manageable and logical also if we need more time in Lisbon vs. Porto, we haven't booked our apartments yet and I'm trying to figure out how much time we should allot to each of these vibrant cities.

2. What areas should we stay in Paris? Should we do hotel or rent an apartment (airbnb/vrbo)? What is a reasonable price per night? 


3. Any areas we should venture off to around those 2 cities, that we should maybe book a hotel in? We love wine, cheese, country, and beautiful scenery.

4. Any recommended day trips?

5. Should we purchase the London and Paris City Pass?

travel,I think I'm done with Airbnb,"I have been a user of Airbnb since 2014.
Despite traveling as a couple, most of the times, we liked to use it to have a ""taste"" of living as a local. 

Hong Kong, Paris, Copenaghen. Great experiences, back when people used to put their own homes/flats up for rent while they were abroad.

During covid we didn't travel and having a baby put a pause on our travelling.

This year we started travelling back in Asia (with our kid) and boy how shitty the whole Airbnb experience has become.

All of our visited places so far (2 in Philippines and 2 in Bangkok) have been so awful.

All places are just sub-rented places, they put a few things in, and they put it up on Airbnb. Dirty as hell, no amenities. Like we are 3 people but you find only 2 forks, 1 mug, 1 glass, etc. One of the places in Bangkok had mold. Another one had mushrooms [Pic 1](https://i.imgur.com/1GVlN1Z.jpg) [Pic 2](https://i.imgur.com/6H5YlND.jpg) growing from the kitchen wooden side panel... 

Rules over rules. I understand some travellers are assholes too, but come on.

It seems the Hosts have lost their common sense. 

Just now, I post this after cancelling my airbnb stay in Makati next week (we are 4 people) because of their rules and requests, and preferred to book 2 hotel rooms (which guess what, they came even cheaper than this airbnb place we got).

travel,Have you ditched Airbnb and gone back to using hotels?,"Remember when Airbnb was new? Such a good idea. Such great value. 

Several years on, of course we all know the drawbacks now - both for visitors and for cities themselves. 

What increasingly shocks are the prices: often more expensive than hotels, plus you have to clean and tidy up after yourself at the end of your visit.

travel,Airbnb host can cancel any time and it's your problem - be careful,"I'm a very well traveled guy, also a resort manager, been in different situations. However, I've just found out that Airbnb reservation can be canceled by a host just like that, two days before arrival. ""Here's your refund, off you go"". Mind you, this is Memorial weekend - everything is booked, prices are through the roof by now.

If we cancel a booking from Expedia or any other OTA (say, due to a rare overbooking situation, an issue with a room or something), the OTA looks for an alternative and we have to cover the guest's relocation cost to a comparable (or better) resort. Not the case with Airbnb - you get zero support, you're on your own.

So imagine: you have a flight overseas with your family and friends, and boom - the host cancels :) I'm definitely going to be more careful when booking Airbnb in the future - now that I know this is their policy.

What's also interesting is that Airbnb actually charges the host a hefty penalty for the cancellation, they just keep the money while you're left to overpay for your stay now :)))",2314,495,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1cz9ekv/airbnb_host_can_cancel_any_time_and_its_your/,2024-05-24 01:37:21,Airbnb
travel,Finally done with Airbnb after a decade of amazing experiences,"I booked an Airbnb for my girlfriend and I for a month, four days in advance. I accidentally put in 1 guest instead of 2 as 99% of the time there is no difference in charge. As I go to add a guest after I booked, I find that an additional guest is $2000 more a month. Mind you, this is to literally share a double bed. The initial price was $3000, so paying $5000 for a couple seems insane. Within 24hrs of booking I communicate this with the host, but they seem firm on it. Trying to be honest with the host, I ask if there's any way I can get a full refund as I can't afford $5,000 for the month. Turns out they had the strict cancellation policy enabled and because its a last minute booking, there's no refunds. I beg the host and Airbnb support to please refund me as there has been no lost time for the host's listing as I just booked it hours ago. The host says no to any refund. Not a penny. I can't afford $5,000, and my girlfriend needs a place to stay, so I cancelled the listing and am now out $3,000. I feel like I just went through a 48 hour fever dream. I know all of the hosts here are going to say ""too bad"", but that ""too bad"" attitude is what is driving more and more people away from the platform. Obviously guests can be extremely frustrating, but moments like this are within the bounds of acceptability and should be remedied. Airbnb hosts charge a premium because you expect at least an absolute bare minimum of hospitality, like being able to immediately cancel quickly after a mistake. Unfortunately, this is the last time I will be using the platform after being an active user for a decade. I have stellar reviews, and have loved every host I've stayed with.

travel,$1k+ AirBnb “Marijuana Smoke Wall Swab Test” Scam (Upheld),"I have been a digital nomad for over a decade so have used AirBnb 8 or 10 times over the years, normally for pretty lengthy stays. Last year the completely ruined a Europe trip for me with 3 of the 4 hosts screwing me over (all 3 still on the site fwiw.)

This recent scam is such a joke I thought it needed to be shared here. To be honest they asked for so much money at first I wasn’t even worried about it as it was so obvious. Silly me.

While traveling to one of the islands in Thailand I booked a room right on the beach. I messaged the host first to ask a few questions, she instantly sends me a warning about no smoking in the room and I say no problem and book because I am not a smoker. The host sends me about a dozen other warning messages of things that aren’t allowed. No problems with any, but it did seem odd to be nailed with so many potential violations months in advance.

I get to the place, it is a tiny (under 100 sq foot) apartment like you often find in Asia. As I look around I notice a lot of odd stuff, like there are 3 smoke detectors, the one that all the units have and then 2 they added. One is in the bathroom, the other is on the balcony. There are nearly a dozen no smoking signs, you can see half a dozen no matter where you stand in the place.

Why do we need 3 smoke detectors in the tiniest apartment I have ever seen? Who puts a smoke detector on a sea facing balcony where the constant sea breeze blows away any smoke instantly?

I also notice I smell smoke when sitting in my room, I go look down and the guy below me is sitting on his balcony smoking. Odd for a building that has so many no smoking signs, but I barely smell it because of the obvious sea breeze.

On my second day I get a notice that if I smoke in the room again I will be evicted. I tell them I did not smoke, they send me some official building notice, and I start taking daily photos of the guy smoking below me in case they actually try to evict me.

This host is a pain in the ass to deal with throughout, they didn’t have everything the room needed but I eventually just quit asking them to bring it because I can tell they are nuts and I don’t want to deal with crazy people. I will spare you those details.

So my time ends, I check out, but I don’t leave a review because I can feel something coming and don’t want to look petty when I need to defend myself. And what a surprise, they claim I smoked in the unit, it took 7 days to clean (this tiny ass place), and it cost them well over a thousand dollars to clean it.

I know AirBnb and their wonderful hosts have done their best to make absurd cleaning fees the norm, but for those that are unaware you can hire a live in maid for 3 to 4 months for that amount of money in Thailand. The place didn’t smell like smoke at all, the constant sea breeze made sure of that. And if it somehow did (it didn’t), it was clearly from the guy who smoked 10 times a day below me.

I explain all of this to AirBnb, I upload the 20 photos of the guy smoking on different dates, and I assume this will be rejected in a day or two. In my mind they asked for such a ridiculous amount of money that they overplayed their hand and it could never go through.

Well, I was kind of right. After I said I wouldn’t pay they talked it over again and said OK you only owe 2/3's. I (obviously) tell them that the scammers won’t be getting a penny from me.

At this time my card on file gets frozen because it was scammed somewhere else. The bank shuts the card down, so there is no payment method. But I have to pay for my next place on AirBnb and the deadline is coming.

For 3 weeks I try to use chat support, I try to call in through wifi via the website, I try the 1-800 numbers. Every time I am told I cannot call anyone in claims, they have to call me. I go out and buy a sim card and update my phone number, I start a chat with front line support confirming they have my current phone number. No phone call ever comes.

They close the case saying I owe nearly a grand. I tell them I will never add a payment method until this is lifted. And this is where it sits, I had to find a new place off AirBnb last minute and my next host got screwed because they can’t get anything resolved in a timely manner.

All along it was very clear they had no idea what was going on and had no intention of finding out. And it is no surprise they side with the property owner at the end.

Based on what? Well, they have the word of the property owner. They have the word of the cleaning staff (so they say.) And they have a ‘marijuana smoke smell wall swab test.’

Yes, they claim the hosts used some swab that showed proof of marijuana smoke in the room. I try to point out a few obvious things here. The first being WTF are you talking about? The second being, even if somehow this is legit (it ain’t), it doesn’t prove when it was smoked, where it was smoked, who smoked it, or that I had anything to do with it.

My 20 photos of the guy right below me smoking on different dates mean nothing. My history of having stayed in AirBnb’s for probably close to a year with no one ever claiming I left a room smelling like smoke or mentioning smoke at all are meaningless. The property owner says it is so so it is so. Oh ya, and the ‘marijuana smoke smell wall swab test.’

 AirBnb has turned into the modern Craigslist. It is a cesspool that has attracted more scammers than anywhere. It has been the biggest causer of stress in my life over the past 2 years since I started using it more frequently. None of the shitty hosts from the past who AirBnb has been told have screwed me over (and they can often see their lies right there in the chat) have been removed from the site. Only my reviews exposing them have.

My advice, don’t use any kind of payment method you want to keep long term on AirBnb. Be ready to close that account when a scam comes. At least the banks and credit card companies have had to deal with this crap so often they know it is coming and will usually have your back.

Take pictures and videos of everything when you check in. And if something doesn't smell right mention it to AirBnb ahead of time. If you wait til after the fact the property owner is the only opinion they care about.",1146,179,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gyhu9b/1k_airbnb_marijuana_smoke_wall_swab_test_scam/,2024-11-24 03:37:47,Airbnb
travel,Threatening from the Airbnb host for my negative review,"I stayed at Italy airbnb, and then wrote a negative review because we felt so stressed with his house rules as below.
- 1 hour early check-in : 15 euro extra
- use of 2 bedrooms for 2 ppl : 30 euro extra
- If you don't text the host when you check out : 50 euro penalty
- If you keep windows open when you check out: 50 euro penalty for each window
- If you keep lights on when you check out :50 euro penalty
- If you keep refrigerator door open when you check out : 200 euro penalty
- If you keep doors open when you check out : 200 euro penalty.... etc, etc.

Of course I respected and followed all house rules, which I would have done that even without any requests, and didn't have any conflict with the host. But we were emotionally so stressed deep in our mind. Because he sent an extreme long list of ""penalty and penalty and penalty"" so many times. We felt like we were in an army camp, not in a vacation.

And then the host pushed me to write a 5 star review like 3 times, so I wrote an honest review mentioning his penalty rules with 2 stars.

What happened next is, bunch of threatening messages from the host saying that 
""I will remove you from Airbnb community."" 
""My lawyer will contact you soon."" 
""You will also need a good lawyer."" 

I reported it to Airbnb customer center, but their response was just saying that well noticed and let them know if the host do something else. Also today, they erased my review saying that it was biased, upon the request from him. I guess that the host has been doing this for a long time and that was how he had a high rating.

How should I deal with this? Should I just stay still without any penalty on the host?

--------


I found today that the other negative review I saw yesterday was gone as well. (That review was saying that the host yelled at her.)
And I also heard from Airbnb that they erased my review because the host insisted that we had a conflict with noise and my review was for a retaliation. (which never happend at all, of course. He had rated me as 5 star, mentioning that I respected his house rules.)

Now the place's rating is 4.89 and he's still a superhost 😂

travel,Airbnb Warning,"Have used AirBnb for years, always opting for Airbnb over hotels. Seldom ever had any issues, but if I did support was quick and fair! Have probably stayed at close to 100 airbnbs! 

Posting a warning as support has gone significantly downhill, and Airbnb is not here to support you! If you take anything away from this: IF you use AirBnb AT ALL please only book FULLY REFUNDABLE stays from here on out. Please learn from my experience. 

Backstory (facts only to keep this short):
- Went to check-in (lockbox property, self check in), cabinet was LOCKED by the host.
- Unable to access property. 
- NEVER accessed property at any time. 
- Contacted host, no response. 
- AirBnb contacted host, no response. 
- AirBnb advised booking alternate accommodation, promised refund. 
- Host messages in the morning and say “this is not possible”. 
- I share photo evidence with host and Airbnb support (sent this at initial check-in attempt for time stamping via AirBnb App). 
- Host claims he has 5 start reviews all over, this is not possible. This is the only defense offered by the host. 
- AirBnb sides with host, no refund. 
- I make my argument to over FIVE different support people (all who are not talking with each other, all are very confused, each one says “wait you never accessed the property??”.) 
- One support person says, on the call, this host is HOSTILE and for your safety do not stay here! Stay in alternative accommodation! 
- We did book and stay in last minute (expensive) alternative accommodation for our entire stay. 
- Spent literal hours on the phone with Airbnb support during our vacation time. 
- As of today the final outcome is HALF of a refund, and I still have random support people calling me despite the case being closed. 

We were left stranded in the streets of a foreign city at 2am. We had PHOTO EVIDENCE. We had the initial support person who told us to book elsewhere. We had a support person on a recorded call TELL US NOT TO STAY AT THE PROPERTY due to the hostile host and for our safety. What else do you need for a FULL REFUND? 

Honestly the worst experience I’ve ever had with Airbnb. Their business model has changed significantly!!! Please be very careful!! Support stated we could have had a full refund IF the host had a policy of full refunds… so if you are going to use AirBnb, only look at properties with full refunds available.

travel,Why I will never use Airbnb anymore and you shouldn't too.,"I won't write long and just be brief about the whole Airbnb experience over the last 1-2 years. I enjoyed using Airbnb for more than 7 years, and now it has come to a point that I will never use it. In the beginning, Airbnb was more organic and personal experience where you could actually enjoy staying in the hosts' place. 

&#x200B;

1) However, now the airbnb is filled with hosts that are just in it for the business and doesn't deliver the adequate service or experience that it used to be. Most of the places aren't well equipped or are vacant, and most of the places are just vacant housing that has not been rented out yet. 

2) And whenever face this kind of issue, the host doesn't take any responsibility. And when you reach out to Airbnb about this issue, their attitude before was ""let me see how I can help you"" to now ""too bad. we can't do anything about it."" or ""we will try to help you out, and see the solution"" and no answer.

3) Prices are way overpriced compared to the price index of the countries I have visited. For example, when I visited Ukraine, Peru, Colombia, and Spain, the daily rent prices were about 5-6x rate of the monthly rent price rate. Which I think it way too overpriced.

&#x200B;

Personally, I have been using Airbnb while I traveled in the past 1.5 years, traveling to about 6 countries: Ukraine, Portugal, United States, Spain, Colombia, and Peru. I had multiple experiences where I checked into the listing that looked a lot different from the photo and doesn't have even a basic amenities, like hot shower, wifi, electronics. I had an experience where I checked into the listing that the host said it's a ""bit"" noisy, but the noise pollution was too extreme to the point that I felt like I was sleeping on a highway street, because the wall has an open air. I messaged host about this, and he ignored my messages. I contacted Airbnb support, and was on the phone line for hours trying to deliver my struggle of insomnia due to noise pollution and that I couldn't sleep for 2 days, and had to check out early from the listing. I think I lost about $400\~ already from the listings that didn't have amenities it described, or even fails to deliver the basic needs of what it can be actually called an ""housing service""

Anyways, the Airbnb support really doesn't care or help the customer, at least based on my experience. I don't know what your experience is. But Airbnb is now filled with hosts that deliver the services or amenity with really poor quality listing, mostly the properties that has not been rented out, for extremely high price.

If you guys could give me alternatives to Airbnb I would appreciate it. I'm sick of this money grabbing host and tech company that doesn't care about customer.

Edit: some people keep saying do the diligence of reading reviews and research, and I do research listings 3-4 hours before I make a booking, and all the bad experiences happened in listings with over 4 stars. And I left 1 star reviews and it would never show up on the listing after few weeks. So there is really a loophole where host controls the review somehow that I do not know about (report to Airbnb for removal, etc)",2228,743,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/rl8wuy/why_i_will_never_use_airbnb_anymore_and_you/,2021-12-21 07:09:50,Airbnb

Tonight she calls me because all of the Airbnb she booked a while ago cancelled on her on the same day. 
First two bookings just got cancelled by the hosts in Turin and Milan. Now the Firenze one has been emailing her asking my mom to cancel. Host is saying he doesn’t want to lose is superhost status if he cancels himself (lol).

Told my mom to never cancel and to call Airbnb directly first thing in the morning.

I googled and there’s nothing in the news regarding new laws in Europe or Italy that could trigger such a sudden uptick in cancellations.

Is it just bad luck or something is happening?

My mother has a strong profile on Airbnb with a lot of good reviews. It’s not her first rodeo on the platform and she is overwhelmingly nice to people. I doubt hosts saw red flags in her, causing them wanting to cancel.

So,  anyone else ?

Without going into detail about our stay, let's just say it was less than perfect and some of the things we disliked have obviously been present for months/years, yet no reviewer bothered to mention some of this glaring issues. So imagine my reaction to this message from our host that arrived shortly after Airbnb asked me to provide a review of the property.

It basically begs us to shield the deficiencies from future guests, while reserving our negative commentary to direct messages with the host. What's especially galling is that we are asked to ignore things out of the control of the host, i.e. leave those things out of our rating. But if the issue is neighborhood noise, poor lighting/poor upkeep in common spaces (in a condo complex), someone should speak up and give others a heads up, don't you think?

Being our guests and reviews are so important to us, this allows us the opportunity to contact the homeowners to resolve whatever it may be to our fullest potential for all our future guests. We can't fix something if we don't know, so we ask that you privately make us aware. **We would rather no review at all then a review that will hurt our business.**

Please consider, there may be factors completely out of our control, and **we ask that you be kind to us directly regarding anything we cannot solely rectify ourselves**. \[*So if there are homeless people camped out on the steps leading up to our apartment, don't mention that detail because this was out of our control!*\]

travel,A rant about Airbnb rants,"I'm tired of reading them. You had a bad Airbnb experience. Bummer. It happens. Please stop posting about it. Unless it's an epic story of double-booking with a furry group or finding a dead body in a closet, it's already been told. I just read a post where the main complaint was the unit didn't have any windows. Did you not look at the photos?! The risks of Airbnb are well-known. The service is highly decentralized. Each place has it's own owner. There isn't a front desk agent ready to make things right. 

Airbnb, compared to a chain hotel, is risky. With a hotel, especially from a reputable chain, you know exactly what you are going to get. A soulless room with artwork that often sits at the bottom of the uncanny valley. A liminal space with no past or future. But it will usually be clean, quiet, and most importantly, if something goes wrong there is someone on site who can assist you. Airbnb doesn't have that. 

Airbnb has a much higher ceiling and lower floor than hotels. I've probably stayed in 30 Airbnbs (or Vrbos/vacation share, etc.) in my life. The top five are some of the best places I've ever stayed. The bottom five are some of the worst. The same, but not as drastic, could be said for independently owned hotels vs. chain hotels (I actually booked a hotel room in Italy once that didn't have any windows, something I didn't realize till right before check-in). An independent hotel will leave you in the lurch far more often than a big chain, but local hotels have a charm and character that no international brand can replicate, despite their attempts with ""autograph"" or ""signature"" collections. 

Airbnbs are often a better value. The gap has narrowed in the last five years, but still, compare the price of a hotel suite to a two-bedroom apartment in a popular neighborhood. Airbnb will almost always be cheaper. Airbnb also takes research. It's a skill, not unlike online dating, to determine what things will look like in real life, and more importantly, what's missing. 

If you want a safe trip with paint-by-numbers lodging, book a hotel. If you want less certainty but higher potential, book an Airbnb. It's that simple. But please stop complaining that something went wrong and Airbnb didn't immediately offer you an immediate solution. That's what hotels are for.

travel,Hold off on your airbnb host review if it's unflattering,"I have been an airbnb user/guest since 2010 and guest reviews are important to my choosing a place and I spend easily a few hours plowing through reviews to get a real picture. My experiences with airbnb over the years have been overwhelmingly positive that only my recent experience with a host in Istanbul reminded me why airbnb could become nightmarish.

Basically it's one of those listings with glamour shots of the place, the so-called studio was much smaller than claimed, so I asked to shorten my stay from 3 nights to 1 night, which the host was nice enough to agree. I gave an honest but unflattering review of the place (nothing nasty though, 3 stars out of 5 in overall, which is my honest assessment)The listing had 8 or 9 reviews with a score of 4.91 prior to my review and the rating score changed to 4.75 after my review). But within a few minutes of my review submission, I received a damaged property reimbursement request in the amount of \~2900 Lira (\~$160) for a supposedly broken toilet seat cover. I declined the request immediately as we did no such damage and didn't see the damage when we were there. I consider myself lucky for the host didn't hate me enough to cause real damage to his own property to scam me, he sent pictures showing toilet cover half-loosened (like someone unscrewed half of seat cover). Airbnb is reviewing and i told my side of the story and haven't heard back.  My boyfriend wish I didn't bother to review or at least not submit it so soon, which I agree as It's just unnecessary stress when we are still travelling.

We settled for $15 and went on our way.  At the airport we were charged a $10 fee for being tourists which was cash only. Our Airbnb expected us to provide a $300 deposit after we already paid and arrived. We rented a vehicle through budget and after returning it, they wanted us to pay $100 for a “scratch”. 

Nicaragua is a beautiful country, but they have a long way to go to attract more tourists. I felt more hospitality in Cuba which has less infrastructure and accommodations. The food was amazing and the people are friendly, but the government is corrupt and very incompetent.

travel,Got robbed 5 mins after arriving at our air bnb..,"

Hey everyone, I’m absolutely devastated and just need to share what happened. My friend and I were super excited about our trip to Palermo, Italy—one of our much-anticipated stops. We got to our Airbnb, and our host was super nice, showed us around, and everything seemed perfect.

But when the airbnb hosts asked for our passport I went to car to grab it and I saw our fully filled back compartment completly empty. We’re now looking at a 9-hour drive to Rome to get to the embassy and try to sort this mess out.

One of our theories is that someone was following us around for about 10 minutes before we got to the Airbnb. They must have seen how full our back compartment was. The moment we parked, they smashed the window to pieces and grabbed our bag. The doors were locked, but that didn’t stop them.

I have no idea what to do. The stuff in that bag… it’s just so hard to even imagine it’s all gone. I’m at a complete loss for words right now.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? What did you do? Any advice on how to handle this would be so appreciated. We’re just trying to figure out our next steps.

travel,Is it just me or has AirB’nB lost its charm?,"I feel like I’m cheating on a lover making this post. 

I used to LOVE AirB’nB. In fact, I haven’t stayed in hotels since 2016, always choosing AirB’n’Bs instead. I always found them simply better quality — more space and utilities for less money. However, now…sadly I think some precious part of the AirB’nB magic is gone. It’s like it sold its soul. 

The last place I stayed in (November, 2022) had a pretty high cleaning fee AND I was left with a list of chores to do before I left. Actually, I’m neat and tidy so I clean up anyway but what got me most was the little laminated signs hung up everywhere. They all said “If you use it, YOU CLEAN IT”. The last part was in all caps, bolded and underlined. It was like being stuck in a passive aggressive employee break room. Yucky.

And the worst thing is, I felt compelled to keep this feedback private for fear of retaliation from the host. 

AirB’nB have either failed to see this trend coming, or they think its negligible from a business point of view. I guess the gradual swing away from AirB’nB isn’t hurting their balance sheet enough…yet. 

It reminds me a little of the way eBay went. Once upon a time eBay had charm and was all about peer-to-peer commerce. Then all the mass-produced items flooded the site and it’s just a poor substitute for Amazon.

travel,Airbnb Customer Service is the Worst,"I should have listened to everyone who says Airbnb is the worst, but I have successfully stayed in Airbnb rentals all over the world. They haven't all been perfect, but that's life. I used to roll my eyes at all the shit posting about Airbnb. But now I am finally starting to understand the issues others have had with them.

I had a 4 night stay booked months in advance. Pics looked good, reviews were good, I had exchanged messages with the host and he was friendly and responsive.

We arrived at the apartment and it was dirty with many things broken, including air conditioning that did not work. To make matters worse, two entire walls of the living room were windows and the blinds could not be closed (confirmed with the host that they were broken), so the entire apartment was essentially a greenhouse reaching temps over 30C.

I took photos and video upon check-in. I contacted the host who committed to fixing some of the issues, including the AC.

On this trip, we had a full agenda with activities booked each day. I admit I wanted to make this place work because we didn't have a lot of time to find another place and move. Of course, in retrospect, we should have just left and gone to the nearest hotel upon check-in.

By the second day, the AC was not fixed. I contact Airbnb and provided the pics I had taken. It took them over 24 hours to get back to me, and they agreed that the place was not as described and agreed to give me a pro-rated refund if we left immediately. At that point, it was late on the third evening of the stay. We were not going to leave late at night, and then there was only one night left, so we decided to stay. Airbnb said they would process a 30% refund for the entire stay due to the inconvenience.

After checkout, the host claimed that I had broken many of the things that were broken upon check-in. He also claimed that we flooded the bathroom, causing damage. The pics he provided in his claim did not even show this damage. I disputed the claim and Airbnb upheld it and told me that I would be charged over $1000 for this, starting with a $500 charge on July 25.

For the next 2 weeks, I spoke to at least 5 different ""supervisors"" at Airbnb customer service. I had to explain the situation to each one. They claimed they reviewed my case but always had facts wrong. One of them even thought I was the host and started bad-mouthing the ""guest"" to me. I was embarrassed for them.

This came to a head two days ago when I received a reminder that my first $500 payment would be charged soon. I finally talked to a supervisor who told me that the payment would not be processed because I had refused it. I had him send me this in writing through the Airbnb app.

And guess what? Today is July 25 the $500 was charged. I contacted them immediately and got a boilerplate response telling me that I could dispute the damage claim in the Resolution Center. Which of course I have already done.

I'm now working with my bank to have the charge reversed but what the hell? I literally have back-to-back screenshots of them telling me I won't be charged and then charging me.

travel,"Despite six months of planning, my passport, wallet, and $2,000 were stolen just 24 hours before my flight to Gabon—but I miraculously made it with one hour to spare. Here are some pictures from Gabon.","Additional context:

I planned this trip for 6 months, but 24 hours before my flight, everything went wrong.

My passport, credit cards, and $2,000 in cash were stolen by the cleaning lady at my Airbnb — less than 24 hours before my international flight to Gabon.

Losing the money sucked, but what REALLY sucked was losing my passport, along with the Gabonese visa I needed to enter the country 😵

With less than 12 hours before takeoff, while waiting for the police to take a report, I found myself digging through nearby trash cans, hoping against hope to find it.

I was about to give up when something caught my eye. 

Could it be? 

I untied a trash bag and saw it — my wallet, buried in a pile of garbage.

My hands shook as I opened it. 

The passport and cards were still there.

The money? Gone, obviously. 

The cleaning lady had discarded my AirTag and the wallet with my passport and just kept the money.

My brother rushed through traffic and got me to the airport with just 1 hour until my flight.

I thought I was safe, but the airline refused to check my bags since I was the last passenger to arrive.

After explaining the madness of the last 24 hours, I convinced an employee to help.

He agreed to check my (overweight, panic-packed) luggage but warned me it probably wouldn’t arrive on time.

I sprinted through security, making it onto the plane as the very last passenger ✈️

I couldn’t believe I had made it.

The flight was 24 hours long — so I had plenty of time to reflect on the chaos.

Then, when I arrived in Gabon, my luggage was delayed for an entire week because it was stuck in Istanbul.

**Moral of the story**: _Even when everything seems to fall apart, trust that resilience and a bit of luck can carry you through. Travel isn’t just about the destination—it’s about embracing the unexpected twists that make the journey unforgettable_ ❤️👊🏽😎🔮

travel,"Just a reminder to be careful, our recent experience in Dublin","Note: I’m not writing this to deter anyone from travelling, just  reminder to not let your guard down while on vacation. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed Dublin and would go back in a heartbeat. 

Wife and I just got back home from a trip to Ireland. I can’t say enough about how wonderful the country was and how hospitable everyone was. We spent the last day and a half of our trip in Dublin. Going into it we had heard about some of the crimes targetting tourists and in general, and knew to be careful. We are also used to higher crime cities, living near and working in one at home. That being said, I was kind of surprised by the sheer boldness of some people in Dublin. 

1. Multiple beggars getting really pushy, borderline harrassing us for money

2. A dude literally followed us down the street and lunged at my wife for her purse, I was able to pull her out of the way before he could touch her, and he was quite drunk and fell over instead

3. Two young dudes saw us leaving our airbnb with our luggage and kind of pushed past us into the main entrance to the locked apartment building before I could get the door closed. I confronted them and they got aggressive, pretending to live there. Had to call the owner who lives there and we got them out.

Like I said before, not trying to scare anyone off, but I wanted to just get some of this off my chest, was particularly shook by the guys probably trying to rob my host. Also just remember that tourists do get targetted and to keep a little extra precaution on the streets.

Edit: Just want to make it clear. This post was less about Dublin in particular, and more just a reminder to be more cautious as a tourist of people that may target foreigners/outsiders.

travel,Airbnb Kicked Me Out of My Hotel on Christmas Eve and Stole My Money!,"   Last night, I booked a room through Airbnb at Poblado Park Hostel. The check-in process was smooth, and I had stayed at this hostel twice before, receiving excellent reviews. I left my luggage in the room and spent the day with my girlfriend.

   Later in the evening, while we were in bed, I received a notification at 7pm stating that my ID was invalid. I had mistakenly shown my old expired ID. The new hotel receptionist requested my passport, which I didn't have, but I provided a photo of my valid visa.

   Despite having a valid 5-year visa, the receptionist insisted on a physical version, even though immigration procedures have transitioned to a fully digital format. The situation escalated when the receptionist informed the Airbnb support that I did not possess a valid ID, portraying it as if I were staying in the country illegally.

   Stressing I'd like to speak with Airbnb customer support, both the receptionist and Airbnb refused. After persistent requests, I managed to obtain the Airbnb phone number. However, as I made the call, the receptionist called the police, falsely claiming that I was at the hotel with a fraudulent ID, insinuating that I was in the country illegally.

   Prior to this incident, I had already booked another hotel through Airbnb. Subsequently, Airbnb canceled my account and confiscated my funds. Despite their promise to call me back on five occasions, I never received a call, and all support tickets were allegedly closed. Only after posting about the issue on Twitter did Airbnb become responsive. They unblocked my account and offered a meager $31 refund. 

   I had reservations for two hotels, both of which Airbnb refused to refund, even though they initiated the cancellation and blocked my account all while my current ID is uploaded to their database.

   This experience, instigated by both the hotel listed on Airbnb and Airbnb itself, has destoyed my Christmas and disrupted my vacation. While I believe their actions may be legally questionable, I choose not to pursue that avenue at this time.

   I've vowed that if Airbnb fails to rectify this situation, I will take further steps to raise awareness within the travel community. And so, here I am!

travel,Never book an airbnb if you are travelling to a city for a big event,"My husband and I wanted to watch F1 race live since last 3 years but because of covid we couldn’t make any plan. This year we decided to watch the granprix at Imola. We both follow vegetarian diet so we decided to book an airbnb so that we can cook some meal if we dont get vegetarian options in the city. We decided to stay in Bologna as the hotels and airbnbs in Imola were booked. 

We live in India. Whenever we do domestic travel we dont use airbnb for accommodation because we have better hotels than airbnbs. This is why my airbnb profile had no reviews till now. So we booked this beautiful and expensive airbnb in Bologna. The host accepted our invitation, asked us about what we do, where we live etc. She said she was excited to meet us as she lived in India for a few years and it would be so much fun to have common topics to talk about.

Now 4 days before our trip (we were going to start with Paris) she whatsapped me saying that I should find the accommodation somewhere else. She gave me 4-5 options and told me that I should book the stay there and she would refund me the entire amt. I panicked like anything because it was too late to book new accommodation. We bought our race tickets too. At this time I had to my literally beg her to let her stay in her house. She said she should have never accepted my invite as I didnt have any reviews on my profile. She first told me that I can use her microwave but during this conversation she told me that I am not allowed to use it. She started making fuss about everything. Can you imagine I had promised her that we will just stay in the house and do nothing else?At this point I seriously lost any interest in staying in that house but I had no other options. 

The reason why she was doing this was because she might have got to know about the race and because of which she might have wanted to rent out her property at a higher rate. We couldnt attend the race because of the floods in northern italy. I am glad I didnt get to meet a horrible person like her.

travel,Booking.com is a scammer,"I booked an apartment through this app for my stay in Los Angeles from August 16 to August 19. To my utter disbelief, when my family and I arrived at the location listed by [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), we were completely ignored. Not a single response from the property. I reached out through text, call, and email—absolute silence.

I had traveled all the way from San Francisco, exhausted and expecting a smooth stay, only to be left stranded with no place to go. Imagine the frustration of standing there, with my family in tow, in a city we didn’t know, and receiving no help whatsoever from the property.

It took ages to finally connect with Booking.com’s customer service, and after waiting in desperation, a representative told me that my only option was to cancel and find another place to stay. I was furious. At that point, I had no trust left in this app, so I refused to book anything further through them. The representative filed a complaint for me, informing me I would have to wait 14 business days for any sort of refund.

Well, here I am, nearly **two months** later, and I’m still waiting. I’ve followed up multiple times, only to be told that the refund is delayed because they can’t reach the property. **Really?** [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) has tried to contact this unresponsive property, I’ve tried, yet this nightmare of a place continues to ghost us all.

At this point, it’s clear to me: this property is either a scam or simply doesn’t exist. And what’s worse—Booking.com has proven to be powerless in resolving this issue or protecting its customers. Instead of taking responsibility, they keep sending the same robotic emails, claiming they still need more time to get a response from the property. It’s been **two months**—how long does it take?

I will **never** book through this app again. If you’re looking for low-cost accommodations, do yourself a favor and go with Airbnb. If you want a reliable hotel, try Hotels.com. But whatever you do, steer clear of Booking.com unless you enjoy being abandoned in a strange city and chasing a refund that may never come.",779,337,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fru0rh/bookingcom_is_a_scammer/,2024-09-29 02:10:03,Airbnb
travel,How to politely tell travel companions (all three of us are 26F) that I need time alone?,"I am traveling with a work friend and her friend in Europe and we are here for two weeks in very safe cities. If I leave to go sit for a bit in the evening alone the ring leader girl gets pissed. Today we are waiting at the train station with plenty of time and I said I’d like to go look at other food options and she says very matter of factly “I’m not splitting up anymore I’m done”. Which feels very controlling for me being an adult and us being in a safe area, also she is with another person and she also has my location. I need time alone or I get overwhelmed, not to do anything adventurous without them but even just to sit at a cafe alone in peace. They’re starting to get on my nerves being very loud Americans and rude, but I’m trying my best to find peace and keep the peace/not argue. One of the girls I’m with is very opinionated and demanding though, so I don’t know what the best approach is to both keep the peace and say that I need time alone?

Edit: Thank you all for your knowledgeable advice and sharing your experiences. I spoke to her and approached the situation calmly and it did not go very well. I stated a lot of the dialogue here- “I am introverted naturally and need time alone to recover. I paid for this trip as well and I want to enjoy myself fully” she responded by shouting that she had made the plan with the other girl originally and I just asked to tag along (this is not entirely true as her and I made the plans before her third friend agreed). She said that I was disrespecting her feelings and it I chose to leave her it would ruin her trip as she would spend the whole time worrying about me. She stated that she would never make plans with me again and we would not be friends, she said that I would be r*ped and drugged for going out alone. She also said that she had told me that she “didn’t want to separate.” This is true, and I will concede on that. But I didn’t realize how dire it was- she doesn’t want me to leave her eyesight whatsoever, even to get a bottle of water at a station on my own. She has the itinerary for the remaining days which does include a bus ride, ferry, trip to a smaller island, etc. she has the only keys provided to the Airbnb and I truly believe that she would not allow me back in or inform me on the other Airbnb information if we didn’t resolve things. I told her that I acknowledge her feelings and I understand and would need time for several moments to myself alone without her and would not drink alcohol (to avoid being roofied) and would not stray farther than 4-500 feet from the building. She was still angry but seemed happy that I was willing to bend to her will. Then I left and had a mimosa anyway for an hour. I sent her excessive information (pictures of my location, when I intend to be back, who I was speaking to, etc) today and she seemed content. I think the best way to handle this realistically to avoid an explosion is by doing that for a day or two and then taking the hour I indicate to her to myself for the rest of the 11 day period and going wherever I would like and doing what I want to do. I believe she needs the illusion of control more than the actual control. It is passive aggressive and deceitful but I’m afraid of missing my flight to America. It is a lot, but I think she will eventually realize how weird her request is. My parents didn’t ask for this much even when I was younger so it’s new to me. Again, thank you all for your input. I figured you would appreciate an update on the situation and of course I do appreciate any further advice or input!

Edit: I told them that I would be sleeping in as I was hungover and she went crazy. She told me that she would no longer be consulting me for travel for the remaining days. We have a week left. she’s giving me the silent treatment. We were trying to catch a ferry out and she Venmo requested me for the ticket last night. I paid her, and when we got to the gate this morning she refused to respond to me when I asked her for the ticket info (there’s an additional pay at the gate charge for the bag), she paid for her and the other girl and left with my ticket, forcing me to buy the ticket again. When I brought it up to her she said “that’s not my problem you knew I bought the ticket last night” She’s choosing to make this awkward, i already stated that I didn’t want to argue and she ignored me.

travel,How much I spent traveling to 43 Countries in 571 Days,"My girlfriend and I are from the USA and have traveled for **571 days**. Both of us have kept track of every $ spent! My hope in sharing this info is to show that you can travel to some amazing places on a budget! 

The two of us worked for a few years after graduating from university and saved as much money as we could. We paid for everything ourselves (except the 10 days of accommodation my girlfriend's parents paid for). 

This is just one person's spend and we split everything we can (accommodation, taxi, groceries, etc). I'd love to answer any questions about the budget or destinations. If you have any questions, feel free to ask or DM me.

All numbers are in USD$.

**IN TOTAL I SPENT $24,866.42 or $43.55 per day. $6.05 over my planned budget of $37.50 per day.** 

THIS INCLUDES ACCOMMODATION AND FLIGHTS!!!

Some details about the categories:

Accommodation - In Europe: Airbnb/Booking.com is our primary accommodation provider, but we stay in hostels \~30% of the time. 

In Asia: we did not use Airbnb, primarily Agoda/Booking.com/Couchsurfing/Hostels/Guesthouses

Activities - This can be museums, renting motorbikes, group tours, etc.

Coffee - This is just coffee from cafes. 90% of the time I drink coffee at the accommodation.

Food - Food/Water/Etc bought from Supermarkets/Convenience Stores/etc basically any food that wasn't ordered from a restaurant/bakery.

Health - Travel Health Insurance, Dentist/Doctor Visits, Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Soap, Shampoo, etc.

Misc - This includes paying for bathrooms (ugh), Fees/Citations, and anything that doesn't fit in the other categories.

Mobile Phone - I don't have a travel phone plan from the States. These are just SIM Cards. I do not buy a SIM card in each country. Moldova had the cheapest SIM at $1.19 for 100 GB of data.

Souvenir - I try to buy a magnet in each country (I have forgotten to buy it for 5 of the nations)

Transportation(local) - Taxis/Uber/Local Bus/Trams/Marshrutkas, etc.

Travel - Anything that takes us from one city or country to another. Ex. Bus from Slovakia to Croatia, Flight from Rhodes to Cyprus. 

Our round-trip flights from the USA to Europe and the USA to Asia were paid with airline miles :)

travel,"Reported issues in Airbnb host’s home, was waiting for support’s resolution, host repeatedly demanded me to leave the premises immediately. Traumatic.","From the moment I walked in the smell to ME was unusual and unpleasant. The bathroom amenities were missing and were not up to par compared to other recent airbnbs I stayed in. Missing required soaps, unknown substance in drain area, etc. It was truly a disappointing arrival and to find out the bathroom wasn’t fully clean. I immediately reached out to Airbnb because I knew I couldn’t stay another night. They reached out to the host and nothing was resolved yet. In the morning I uncovered BLACK MOLD, and figured this was my opportunity to seize a refund and get out of here. Keep in mind that I haven’t seen or spoke to the host since my arrival- I didn’t reach out to them about the issue because I figured they could become defensive and it was somewhat ‘minimal’ problems, except the black mold problem. When they finally confronted me about the issues, they asked me about the smell and I said that it was very strong and figured it was food, to which they said yes it was because it’s a ‘family home’. (Honestly this can be up for debate but if I was a host, I would be cautious about the food aroma that I allow to linger in my home, especially when there are guests! Not everyone can handle strong odor) Then they tell me that the black mold I see is NOT mold, and to look at the other walls, there was no mold present so it’s not mold (dumb argument really). They claimed the blackness on the wall, “not mold”, is due to humidity, disregarding the fact that humidity creates black mold… Anyways, this conversation occur because they had to enter the room to send support photos. After this happened, they tell me that I need leave immediately, even messaging me that my presence is making them uncomfortable EVEN after I told them that i too feel the same but am waiting here for Airbnb to confirm when this has been resolved. Support warned me that if I checked out before they come to a resolution that I risk losing the refund. So im sitting there waiting for support while the host is repeatedly telling me to leave. Honestly was nervous they would call law enforcement on me. I still had to wait minutes after for Airbnb to get back to me. In the end, I got the refund and got the f out of there but the experience was traumatic- im scared to use Airbnb in the future, when I honestly felt this way before (usually hit or miss). My last few Airbnb stays were actually good (different countries though) but this reminded me of the horror, especially when the host LIVES THERE!

travel,Make her pay? My friend bailed on a trip last min.,"What would you guys do in this situation:

I planned a trip to Washington for 5 people and now just 2 weeks before the trip my very best friend who was coming, bailed. When I originally planned the trip, I made sure to get an Airbnb and rental car to accommodate 5 people and we all agreed to split it 5 ways. Now that we’re so close to the trip, none of it is refundable. She hasn’t given me a penny since I booked everything and I have a feeling it’s because she knew she’d bail all along and now she’s just flat out avoiding the topic anytime we talk about it. 

Would y’all still make her pay her portion of the trip? (I know she has the money, she’s just very frugal.) I feel wrong making everyone else pick up her “tab” because it’s not their fault but I also don’t want to pick it all up myself either.

travel,I just got back to the States from traveling around Europe for 6 weeks with my wife and 1.5yo son. Here is what I learned.,"
Edit: I actually had screwed up some formulas in my spreadsheet. The true cost of our trip was somewhere between 18-20k, as I'm too lazy to split all our credit card bills into travel/non-travel.

At first I was considering just posting a reel of pictures from my trip and collecting some modest comment karma, but instead I'd like to share my experience in a way that might benefit others who might be thinking of extended trips to Europe with a child of a similar age. Old enough to walk and enjoy things, young enough to be free on all modes of transport.

Our itinerary was Stockholm - Berlin - Munich - Riva, Italy - Genoa - Corsica - Rome.

1) The cost.

Our six weeks of travel cost about $18-20k My original early budget of $10,000 was completely delusional for the kind of trip we were looking to have. 12k of that was on accommodations and travel, and the rest on food, activities, and other things (travel insurance, car rental, etc..) You can definitely do it for less, but then you will be staying farther from city centers, cooking more at home, seeing fewer sights, and generally will be concerned more with budgeting. Personally, this approach was antithetical to the kind of trip we wanted to take. In our minds we were on a trip of a lifetime, and penny pinching seemed like it would just ruin our fun. I believe we made the right choice, though obviously we had to ensure that this was financially viable for us.

2) The work.

Roughly speaking, I took about 3 of those weeks off and worked for the other 3 weeks. Some were half days, some were a few hours off in the middle of a day, some were several days off at a time, all depending on circumstances. Being able to do this required a lot of prep communication with my colleagues on ensuring continuity and progress on our projects, but my job is extremely accommodating in this regard. My advice for those in remote jobs who are unsure if this is possible at their workplace is first closely research company policy, then find others who've worked remotely from Europe while employed at your company, and then bring it up with management. In my opinion, working in Europe on American (eastern, time zones more west might require a formal schedule adjustment on your part) time is perfect when traveling with a child. . They're up early, so you can go out and do stuff, go to playgrounds, museums, sights. Then your spouse can take over childcare for the first half of the workday (or you can take the first half of the day off) and for the second half of the workday the baby is sleeping and you can't go anywhere anyway, might as well work. At first I was concerned that work was going to be a huge bummer, but aside from a couple of days when I would have rather continued exploring Roman ruins or drinking beer in Munich, it was actually good to have a productive outlet rather than just have an extremely long vacation.

3) The childcare

If you are an average American family with a child, you likely get some occasional or regular help with your child or children from others, like your parents or a nanny, or daycare. When traveling, you will not have those people around (unless of course the grands or your nanny are going to travel with you). Having to take care of your child 24/7 without any help while on vacation is taxing and can feel like ""why the fuck am I doing this in the first place??"". I definitely had those thoughts. However, there are some important positives to this fact and ways to manage the weight.
The biggest benefit is the bonding experience. At home, my wife and I were both working, and trading off healthcare duties based on schedules and nanny availability. We were tired, unfocused, irritable. Often, we did not feel like our son was getting the best of us. On this vacation we were laser focused on him out of necessity. We were both present for all his little milestones and firsts, discoveries, foreign words he learned. His needs and presence were a blessing and opportunity to bond in a way that in my opinion would not have been possible in our particular situation.

3a) Outside childcare

This is apparently controversial, but mommy and daddy need a break sometimes. During this trip we employed the services of babysitters we found through reputable agencies, babysitters we found on Facebook (with a paper trail and references!!!), and of drop in day cares. The services available were dependent on location, and we had to get creative. Some hotels partner with babysitting agencies, some airbnbs have babysitting recommendations as an amenity, some cities have easy access to on-demand babysitting (Berlin) but drop-in daycare doesn't seem to exist as a concept (also Berlin). In Rome, we sent out emails to all kindergartens within reasonable distance of our Airbnb asking if we can drop our child off there. One said yes, and we used their services, but finding a babysitter seemed like a complicated process that we were ultimately not comfortable with. The going rate for a sitter from an agency in Stockholm is 60$ an hour. So we used facebook and found a fantastic sitter for 20$ an hour.
Do lots of research, send lots of emails, and ask lots of questions. As with anything related to parenting,  some people are going to judge you and claim that you're insane for ""letting strangers watch your child"". Well, a lot of strangers watched our child while on this trip and they all did a great job. Decide what you and your partner are comfortable with, set ground rules, and enjoy a much needed break while a (hopefully) qualified professional watches your child.",914,996,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/16x9xki/i_just_got_back_to_the_states_from_traveling/,2023-10-01 19:13:57,Airbnb

travel,Final hours of my 16 months around the world trip,"**TLDR:** Made redundant at the end of 2022, didn't want to find another job. Packed up and travelled the world.

**update** done for now, flight soon, thanks for the questions. 

**update 2** ok really done now, boarding.

I am currently sitting at the airport, patiently waiting for my final flight home after a long 16 months around the world. I have 5 hours to kill before I board. So if you have any questions, Ill be happy to answer as much as I can, to the best of my knowledge, to help anyone out. **Edit:** I don't want to discuss Total cost, but more than happy to discuss specifics.

In 2022, the company I was working for was coming to a close. It was at this time I was made redundant, and didn't really know what I was going to do. I have no kids, and nothing else tying me down. That coupled with the fact that we were cooped up after some of the most longest and strictest lockdowns it was time to get out and see the world.

The objective of the travels was essentially to explore and ""live"", as you will see most of the places we stayed were capital Cities. We ended up doing ALOT of day trips from the major capitals either by train or tour company. Most of the time it was much cheaper just to do a full day tour than to actually hire a car for the day.

Most of the places we stayed were booked through either [booking.com](http://booking.com) or Airbnb (booking.com was a much cheaper option most of the time)

travel,2 weeks in Uganda,"My husband and I spent a few months traveling Africa earlier in the year, with Uganda being the 8th country that we visited. We rented an SUV and spent our time bouncing around the western part of the country. We absolutely loved it! The people were so friendly and funny. The wildlife and scenery were so diverse, really enjoyed all of the different monkeys! Never felt unsafe. Ugandans know how to cook, consistently the best food we had of all the African countries we visited. Felt like we just scratched the surface, would love to go back one day.

Itinerary:
- 2 nights on Lake Victoria with the goal to see a Shoebill. They are WAY bigger than I expected, almost human sized. The creepy factor was strong! Incredible.
- 4 nights in/around Murchison Falls National Park, where we self-drove safari, did a boat trip to see the falls, and took a guided chimp tracking tour at Budongo. More on this below.
- 2 nights at Lake Nkuruba Nature Reserve with a visit to Bidogi Wetlands to see a variety if monkeys. Four different kinds of monkeys live at the reserve, real cool to be able to stay in such close proximity to them. 
- 2 nights at Queen Elizabeth National Park, where we self-drove safari. Was our least favorite park in Africa. We stayed at Songbird Camp which I can't recommend enough though! Animals wander freely through the property, were able to eat dinner while watching elephants 50 ft away, incredible! Owned by the friendliest Ugandan couple. 
- 2 nights at Lake Bunyonyi, stayed at an Airbnb that required boating into. Great to relax and paddleboard.
- Final day we drove across the border to Rwanda. We ended up leaving the car in Kigali, awesome set up made possible by Roadtrip Africa.

Murchison ended up being one of our favorite spots for safari, the landscape diversity made it stand out - had the savannahs landscapes typical for safari, but also dense rainforest (lots of monkeys!), plus the Nile river so could see lots of hippos & crocs. The falls themselves were absolutely incredible, a huge highlight was viewing them from above. We stayed at budget lodging in the park in a small, barebones cabin. Woke up in the middle of the night to a hippo right outside our window, sounded like a lawn mower when eating very loud, so memorable! Warthogs all over, was just a really cool experience. 
We opted to do Budongi vs Kibali for chimp tracking as it was significantly cheaper. Involved a lot of bushwhacking in the rainforest, it was an awesome experience and we saw a lot of chimps! I ended up getting swarmed by fire ants (I didnt pack high socks, stupid mistake. Literal ants in my pants, ouchies) and felt like I got electrocuted by some plant that left a big welt, def a full value experience! I do reccomend it though, just being able to hear chimps call to each other was in itself worth the money. ",1907,59,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gvwyc2,2024-11-20 18:50:37,Airbnb

travel,Issues with an AirBNB and looking for opinions on how to proceed. ,"Staying in an Airbnb that is in a great location, is a beautiful space, and on paper was great, but we’ve had a few issues and I don’t know what grounds I have to ask for reimbursement


1. Hot tub was on listing, but upon checkin and firing it up it was clearly NOT maintained. It had green water, stank terribly like rotten eggs, stank up the whole house, and the owner advised us not to use (uh.. duh). We were excited to use this outdoor space while our baby was asleep and we were stuck at tbs property.

travel,"What was the tourist trap of the year for you, this year?","I will start. For me, it was this medieval tavern like restaurant called III Draakon, in Tallin.  

There was no menu, just an old lady at the counter dressed in a costume. I sat at the table and she yelled at me saying I had to come to the counter. Then she won't say what they had and if I tried to ask she shut me off, making fun in front of everyone, in loud voice. I walked out feeling awful. I went knowing there will be some act, but this made me feel like she was genuinely being rude (or racist).

Later learned from people in hostel who persisted through the rudeness that they had to give what the lady asked for lazy watery soup and beer, and that the food isn't good but just overly priced.

travel,Gas Leak in Airbnb… Reimbursement Request ,"We showed up last night at 3 AM at our Airbnb (flight delays - thanks worldwide IT outage). This is in Benton Harbor Michigan, [USA].
Upon arrival, the place absolutely REEKED, but we didn’t know exactly what caused it. It wasn’t necessarily a gas smell, more a rotten smell like something had died. 2 of the 4 in our party were so tired they just braved the smell and tried to go to bed, but the other two couldn’t stand it and drove around for hours trying to find a hotel for the night to get out of the stench, but nothing was available at that hour. Once they got back, they found the gas was left on the stove and turned it off. We reported it the next morning at 7 AM and the owner sent a ‘gas team’ to check out the property, who determined there was no leak, just a stove left on the- either by previous tenant or the cleaning crew.

Thankfully the smell slowly subsided, but even close to 48 hours into the trip, there still is a slight bit of the awful stench lingering.

Now we are negotiating with our owner on price/reimbursement… it’s a 3 night stay for $2,000 and the owner has offered us $500 off our total stay. What should we do…?? We somewhat feel like the risk of this house blowing up if we decided to light a candle is playing in our favor. Ideally we would get all of the stay comped considering we could’ve f%%^ng died… but we would agree to pay essentially the operating costs of the place for the weekend (maybe $300?).

Keycard is picked up from a lockbox in the lobby then coming to the unit/place there is a digital lock, provided with their code from the email. This property is too smart enough to not activate the code or something and I kept on trying for 40mins, I kept on writing them everything and send pics and videos that their code is not working only then magically the code worked after sending the proofs. 
Part 2: entering the room there is a lock box to get the key to enter the room. Again it is not working! Sent pics i kept on trying only to find out that the box is broken, needed to manually open the box even after pushing the lever.

Now here is why i feel weird. I was communicating with the property owner and i think the caretaker. 

Caretaker replied late to help on getting inside the room, then the owner replied “ The room is now opened” I haven’t sent them update regarding that I got in.

travel,Cruises suck! Never again.,"Just to give some context, Ive mostly solo traveled. I started in Europe at 19, then did the typical SEA backpack trip in my 20s and then I met my amazing GF who never really traveled much except on a few cruises.  Together we’ve traveled Europe and Mexico, from hostels, to Airbnb’s, to all-inclusive. Ive done it all. 

She however has kids and insisted this was the easiest and most affordable way to travel with them. We did a cruise in 2018 and now, here I am, 2:30am reluctantly cruising off the coast of Nassau. 

Last month she and I were sailing the San Blas Islands from Panama to Colombia. It was incredible.  Yeah we got a little sea sick, it was slow going, cramped and we got heat rash but it was an absolute adventure. The other passengers were so fun, the captain, his wife and the crew were amazing to travel with. We both agreed that it was a trip of a lifetime.

Now I’m on a boat, emitting plumes of black toxic fumes in the air and who know what I’m the ocean, with 3000 other people, who seem to have nothing more interesting going on in their lives other than talking about the last cruise they were on. The two swimming pools were so hazy from the crowds of people drinking and probably pissing in it that our kids didn’t even want to swim in it.

“But,” the cruisers tell you, “you just picked the wrong cruise line!” 

No, no I didn’t. Sure the food is better on Princess cruises, but the food isn’t the problem.  It’s the waste, it’s the awful working conditions, it’s the sheer amount of pollution cruise lines produce, the people, omg the people, with their matching cruise themed shirts… it’s tacky.  Cruising is a culture I want no part of and I’m so ashamed I’m participating in it.   Trying Disney or Holland America won’t change that.

And for the record, I totally get the difference between vacationing and traveling. Not every vacation needs to be some exotic adventure to some jungle village, but this isn’t exactly relaxing either. There is nothing a cruise offers that is better than an all inclusive resort or a nice rental on the beach. Cruising is not cheaper either that’s for damn sure. And if you tell me you cruise so you can see multiple destinations in one trip I’ll tell you you’re a fool. Going zip lining or swimming with dolphins for 3 hours isn’t seeing anything. You’re on a floating Reno NV grade casino.

For those that only cruise I beg you to step outside your comfort zone for just once and consider a less wasteful way of traveling.  I can’t take back my actions, I’m as guilty as the rest of them but I’ll say this… after two cruises I’ll never go again. Apologies for any typos, it’s late and I’m on my phone.

travel,Is anyone else over Airbnb?,"I feel like the majority of my Airbnb experiences in the last couple years have been negative. My conclusion is that as prices have creeped up, hosts simply aren’t reliable or professional enough to maintain a decent value proposition at that price range. I’ve heard this from a few other people and one of them only does boutique hotels now as an alternative.

I suppose since you don’t know me you could assume that I am a crazy person which would be one explanation, but for the sake of this conversation try to stick with me and believe I am a considerate person. Some recent negative encounters at Airbnb’s costing well north of $500/night, some over $1k/night:

- Host asks us to fill up a bucket in the shower with our used water and carry it down to a washing machine since we are in water crisis. She had an indoor pool on the property (for herself, not the guest house where we stayed).

- After a location is advertised as having a hot tub, reading in the check-in instructions that gas is expensive and we’ll need to pay $40 cash and wait several hours for tub to heat up. Again, this was at an upscale listing costing nearly $1000/night.

- No sheets in a unit that advertised their Crate and Barrel pullout couch in the listing. When she responded to our question about sheets the next morning, she said they were ‘in the closet’. None of us were able to find any sheets in the multiple closets on the property, and I had a feeling any further communication would result in her simply not believing us.

- This one is going to strain your trust that I am not a crazy person. A host left review that they would not host me again because my text that said ‘checked out’ (after he asked me to let him know when we checked out) was deemed too curt.

I have also not left a review for any of these places since it is too mentally exhausting to continue thinking about the negative experiences and dealing with the inevitable host rebuttal. I don’t know about you but I find the Airbnb review section to be one of the more fraught places online that id rather avoid, especially since there is no incentive for me to engage further after checkout.",83,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/o5feo8/is_anyone_else_over_airbnb/,2021-06-22 05:32:52,Airbnb

travel,Is a 30% refund fair for misleading Airbnb listing due to construction noise?,"I rented an Airbnb (entire apartment)(Europe) for three nights. The flat was listed as calm and with a quiet backyard. Since I wanted a peaceful stay, I booked the Airbnb.

The apartment was not calm, and the backyard was not quiet. From 7 am until around 3 pm, there was ongoing construction work in the backyard, including the use of a chainsaw starting at 7 am. It was so loud that it was hard to sleep and rest, even with earplugs and the windows closed. This affected my stay, and I wouldn’t have booked the apartment if I had known about the noise.

I contacted the host, and he admitted that he knew about the construction work but did not mention it to me beforehand. He thought it would be fine as the guests staying there the couple of weeks before didn’t complain.

I asked for a refund, and Airbnb is now offering me a 30% refund. The cleaning fee and administration fee are not included in the refund basis. I am somewhat okay with the partial refund, even though it’s not much.

Is this normal practice? This seems like false advertising, and the host should have mentioned the construction work in the listing since he knew about it.

travel,Airbnb offers no protection at all to the guests,"I’m so annoyed by this interaction that I’m just here to vent. My trip in Turkey got extended because my flight to Istanbul got delayed due to bad weather. Where I had plans to fly out out Istanbul in the evening, my flight got pushed to next day. 

On finding out, I booked a place through airbnb. Post booking, I was informed  the next available flight lands around 11PM. The problem I ran into was the host had mentioned as 12 as the last check in time. Once I informed the host, he said it won’t be a problem but I’d need to pay a charge, which turns out to be more than 60% of the amount paid for booking. This was supposed to a place to catch some sleep so I had kept a low budget and on learning the host’s demand, I asked him to reconsider and charge a fair 10-20%. At this time, he stopped responding for next few hours so I had no idea where things stand.

To avoid getting stranded late at night, I booked another place on bnb and asked the first host to cancel my booking. He didn’t respond until late at night. Meanwhile, I reached out to airbnb with my case. They didn’t respond until the next day where they said the rule was 12:00AM. I reverted saying that I was happy to pay a fair additional fee for checking in 30 mins late to which they have not responded to in the last 3 days.

travel,What’s with This (Attempted?) Airbnb Scam?,"Hello r/travel! Hoping y’all can help me make sense of a puzzling Airbnb interaction I’ve had happen twice in the past month. I am holding two Airbnb reservations for an upcoming Europe trip—one in Slovakia, one in Lithuania, if location matters—both Superhosts, both well rated with a lot of reviews and relatively recent stays, and both currently still within the window for free cancellation. Not immediately after booking, but seemingly a random amount of time later, each Airbnb sent me a message on the Airbnb messaging platform trying to lure me into clicking a third-party off-site URL. The Lithuania Airbnb’s message was a pretty obvious scam (“oh we need to reverify your payment, transfer a deposit here and we’ll transfer it right back”—yeah no), while the Slovakia Airbnb’s was a more generic “go to this link to finish your registration and confirm reservation.” I obviously did not click on either link.  

Where it gets weird, however, is that in both cases, before I could report the scam message to Airbnb (I’m in the US, so both of these interactions occurred 7/8 hours ahead on Euro time, i.e. overnight when I was asleep) I got a follow up message on the Airbnb messaging platform from each host, telling me to disregard the scam messages with the bad links and reaffirming that my booking is still confirmed. The Slovakia host said something to the effect of “we asked Airbnb to delete that previous message, but they said they can’t.” So I ask you, what’s going on here?? Is it that common for Airbnb hosts to get hacked and have fraudulent third parties try to insert themselves into the middle of a transaction? Are the hosts trying a very halfhearted scam to get at the most gullible travelers and then back pedaling when they don’t get an immediate taker (seems like a poor risk for getting your Airbnb shut down)? Any other conceivable explanation? 

More importantly, can I trust the follow up messages from the hosts that these are still legit reservations? Should I cancel while I’m still in the free cancellation window? I would prefer not to, since now we’re getting closer to the trip and I suspect the selection of replacement Airbnbs will be smaller, plus who’s to say I won’t just happen to encounter the same weird scam from another Airbnb?

travel,"Cost Breakdown of 148 Days of Travel in Europe for $5,439.26","Hi! My girlfriend and I are from the USA and have been traveling for the past 148 days. Both of us have kept track of every $ spent! My hope in sharing this info is to show that you can travel to some amazing places on a tight budget! We each have a daily budget of $37.50 or $75 combined. This is just one person's spend and we split basically everything.

I'd love to answer any questions about the budget/destinations/travel planning/etc. Any questions you may have feel free to ask or DM me.

All numbers are in USD$.

Some detail about the categories:

Accommodation - Airbnb/Booking.com is our primary accommodation provider but we do stay in hostels \~30% of the time.

Activities - Museums, Walking Tours, Castles, Bobsled Runs (Sigulda, Latvia is awesome btw), National Parks, etc.

Coffee - This is just coffee from cafes. 90% of the time I drink horrible instant coffee at the accommodation.

Food - Food/Water/Etc bought from Supermarkets/Convenience Stores/etc basically any food that wasn't ordered from a restaurant/bakery.

Health - Travel Health Insurance, Toothpaste, Mouthwash, Soap, Shampoo, etc.

Misc - This includes paying for bathrooms (ugh), Fees/Citations.

Mobile Phone - I don't have a travel phone plan from the States. These are just SIM Cards. I do not buy a SIM card in each country. Moldova had the cheapest SIM at $1.19 for 100gb of data.

Souvenir - I try to buy a magnet in each country (I have forgotten to buy it for at least half of the countries).

Transportation(local) - Taxis/Uber/Local Bus/Trams/Marshrutkas

Travel - This is anything that takes from one city or country to another. Ex. Bus from Slovakia to Croatia, Train from Mostar to Sarajevo in Bosnia & Herzegovina.

travel,"Easy to fly to, less crowded beachfront hotel or Airbnb with hiking ","We've had two great trips so far and are looking for the next one. Our priorities are: less crowded, beautiful beaches, easy to fly and hiking. We always rent a car and drive wherever the island takes us. We've already been to:

1. Seychelles: Not crowded at all, one beach more beautiful than the other, beautiful hiking trails, friendly people, diving and snorkeling. We stayed at the [DoubleTree by Hilton Seychelles](https://maps.app.goo.gl/otPSHwQp87Mqmi6u6). Just look at [this image](https://cf.bstatic.com/xdata/images/hotel/max1024x768/483748635.jpg?k=b2d26c80ca1dc4fe6add677b78d2aacc4e51296e9ea7bc44472be11622881b4e&o=&hp=1), what more could you want! [The other hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/czc4Gojhdb7PWMUE6) on Praslin was nice, but too expensive.
2. Mauritius: Nice beaches, but no comparison to Seychelles, Lots of hiking, snorking and waterfalls. We stayed at the [Paradis Beachcomber Golf Resort & Spa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZJiqpqmM7Q1jKchu9). Just look [at this image](https://cdn.beachcomber-hotels.com/v9/sites/default/files/styles/silder_desktop/public/paradis/paradis-beachcomber-golf-resort-spa-mauritius-slider-d.jpg?itok=QDKYzAvS).

Both hotels didn't cost too much and both places were relatively easy to get to by plane. Now I've looked at the Caribbean, Thailand, and Indonesia. But so far I haven't managed to find a worthy successor. Others are more difficult to travel to or the beaches seem to be overcrowded. The closet so far is Gaudeloupe or St. Lucia because of the Pitons. The final boss will be Japan with Okinawa one day, if we can handle the flight: [Hyatt Regency Seragaki Island](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EwfHojdZBJWCc45K6)

travel,Booking.com SCAM….. Please be careful ,"My friend has her accomodation on Airbnb the advert has been copied and put on Booking.com. she contacted them over 3 months ago to tell them it is fake. They didn’t believe her. 

Her place is just accommodation for 2 people. I have actually stayed there, it’s gorgeous.

These criminals are charging massive amounts of money and advertising 2 apartments.

Read below what she has tried to do to get [booking.com](http://booking.com) to take it down.  


Almost three months on and I still haven't been able to get [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) to remove the fake Cottage on Dhurringile listing on their site.

I'm being treated like the criminal by them, and the scammer has all the rights!

Sadly, we had three families turn up last weekend, all with fake bookings!

I'm at my wits end! 

I approached the ABC and met with one of their journalists yesterday, who couldn't believe how [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) have handled this situation.

I was also able to put them in touch with one of the families who had a fake booking.

I'm hoping the ABC might be able to put a rocket up someone's arse, but frankly after my dealings with this company, I doubt it.

My advice,  if you make a booking with a booking platform, make sure you get something from the property owner and steer clear of Booking.com!

Also, someone who picked up that it was a scam, has now given the listing a BAD review with a 1 star rating...hopefully this might deter someone else from making a booking!

I seriously don't need this stress atm!

Do you know any alternatives for Airbnb in Europe?

Airbnb is too expensive (most of the flats are bought only for renting on the platform). Hotels are not an option for me, because I often work while travelling and I need a desk/table. I'm also hesitant to contact flat owners outside of a platform to avoid scams. I know there's sous location in France (sublease), but I don't know if this is a common practice elsewhere

travel,TIL AirBnB can make it difficult to redeem travel credits.,"I have $50 in AirBnB travel credit that I earned through referrals that I wanted to use on an upcoming $98 reservation in Palawan, Philippines. When I was checking out, I noticed that the credit didn't apply so I reached out to @AirBnBHelp on twitter. 

At first they said that was odd and could apply the discount retroactively. I said I would think about it first and then tried to take them up on their offer a few days later. Then, the representative told me that my reservation needed to have a minimum of $200 and thus, did not apply as a qualified reservation. 

**WHAT?!?!**

I did some digging and found the [general T&C](https://www.airbnb.com/referrals/terms_and_conditions?offer_name=default_20_20) with the following language:

> Travel Credits will automatically appear as a coupon on the checkout page, and must be used on a Qualifying Reservation within one year from the date they are issued.
> ....A Qualifying Reservation must have a total value (excluding guest fees or taxes) of at least $75 (or its local currency equivalent* if we support it).

What gives? My reservation was $88 before taxes and fees. I reached out to them again and they point me to this [page:](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/84/how-do-referrals-and-travel-credits-work)

>A qualifying reservation typically has a total value of $75 USD or more, excluding guest fees and any taxes. **These amounts may vary during promotional periods.**

The current promotional period (till May 6, 2016) has a reservation minimum of $200 for a qualified stay. After that, it could go back down to $75 or way up even.

**F U AirBnB**. That fact that you don't make these minimums clear in black and white irks the ish out of me. You can have your stinking credits back.

My full rant can be found [here](http://www.whereintheworldisnico.com/assemblage/2015/12/1/til-airbnb-redeeming-referral-credit-gotcha) if you care to read.

travel,We came back to our Airbnb in Colombia to find the door opened. The host ensured us that no-one had entered and that we had not closed the door properly. The next day the cleaner entered the room without knocking. What should we do?,"So we are staying in an Airbnb room that has an electronic lock and keypad. The door is quite difficult to close - it doesn't lock immediately, you have to hold it closed by pulling the handle for almost 10 seconds before you hear the lock engaging and the key pad lights up. If the door doesn't lock, it noticeably swings open so it is pretty clear if it isn't closed properly. I can be pretty careless at times, but my partner is very vigilant when it comes to everything, ESPECIALLY travelling. We exercised even more caution because the Airbnb is located in a bit of a sketch location.

We left the accomodation yesterday at around 3 pm and came back around 6:30 pm to see that our Airbnb door war open. We rushed in and checked all our belongings and luckily nothing had been moved or taken. We were shocked and confused, however, at why the door was left open as we were certain we closed it properly and remembered both pushing against the door before leaving, ensuring it was closed. We messaged the host straight away informing him of what happened. He checked the security footage and ensured us that no one entered our room. He said that no one entered and that the door was badly locked. He sent us screenshots of the security footage showing the door closed after we left, and then a subsequent screenshot of the door ajar 20 or so minutes after saying ""4:45 pm the door opens on it's own with the wind because it was badly closed"". This confused us further, because it was an electronic lock that held the door closed, so it was either completely closed or the door would swing open. It made no sense that the ""wind"" could swing it open. He never sent us the video but we didn't want to be a pain and nothing was taken or disturbed in our room, so we decided to thank the host and leave it. However, that night we felt unsettled and struggled to sleep.

Check out was today at 11 am. I was still in bed when I hear the beeping of our door keypad. I was shocked and confused when I saw the door starting to open and someone entered. It was a small room so the door opens straight into the bedroom. I started shouting as both my partner and I were NOT decent. The person immediately retreated but obviously struggled to close the door (it is very tricky to close), to the point where I had to get up and lock the door from the inside. Again we messaged the host explaining the situation and he said it was the cleaner who thought we had checked out, and apologised.

After the second incident, we have become extremely suspicious of his explanation of the first incident. We are convinced someone came in yesterday as well (probably the same cleaner who doesn't know how to close the door properly) but the host didn't want to admit that someone had entered our room and lied, blaming us. We now feel exposed, unsafe and lied to.

We don't want to be a pain, and we understand that mistakes happen. Nor do we want to get the cleaner in too much trouble. But we can't help feel hard done by. What do you think we should do?

travel,Beware of AirBnb Experiences,"I wanted to put out a warning about AirBnb customer service with regards to their ‘AirBnb Experiences’. There are lots of great experience out there, but just beware that if the experience goes bad, AirBnb will side with the host. Here is my story. 

I did a AirBnb Experience that was a tour in Montreal. I planned it for my boyfriend’s birthday. It had 4.9 stars with a lot of positive reviews. The guy who usually gave the tour was out of town. The guy who gave the tour was stoned, got us lost 7 or 8 times, didn’t know anything, missed key parts of the tour and told us very very incorrect ‘facts’ (like you can see New York from Montreal). 

I was sure AirBnb would stand by me when I asked for a refund. After a month of back and forth with AirBnb they said they could only do so if the host agreed. So I got $60 back on a $330 payment (there were 6 of us). The rationale was that was what the host agreed to because the guy who gave the tour said ‘we looked like we were having a good time’. Brutal. I have since cancelled my AirBnb account based on that experience.

travel,Beware of fake booking.com listings (I was scammed in London) ,"I booked a say in an apartmenr through booking.com, it was nonrefundable but it was a decent price for Mayfair, London (2000£ for 4 nights) and looked very nice. I was booking quite last minute so I booked it without much thought as I have only had positive experiences with booking apartments. 

The day before my check in I received a message that I have to PayPal the host 1500£ as a safety deposit to receive the address - this seemed very sketchy. Then I found the photos listed again but this time as a different apartment and different location - I knew I was being scammed!

I called the customer support and that was the worst experience ever because after speaking to 3 different people and a manager, I was told to pay the PayPal fee outside of booking as they believe it is real and as I agreed to the property policy by booking with this host! I informed them about the duplicate listings and if they can guarantee the paypal money if I don’t receive the address, they said they can’t guarantee that! Booking told me that if I don’t PayPal the money to the host I won’t even get a refund form booking. 

So I paid the fee and hoped to receive the address, guess what, I didn’t get anything despite repeatedly reaching out to the host. 

I called my local booking support not their international one (never call the international support they are incompetent), my local support said these scams happen every day now and they called the host. The customer support guy said the scammer was screaming at them and was hysterical and rude for being exposed. I received my PayPal and booking money but stayed in the center of London without a place to stay.

I love staying at apartments but with booking and airbnb scams happening every day, I have to recommend everyone to stay in hotels until booking.com manages to put better anti-scam policies into place. I was lucky my local support helped me, the international support basically just kept repeating - “no worries mam we think the listing is real, we can’t help you” 

Another scam I found is a villa in st tropez, which after reverse image searching on google is a famous villa in Corsica! This was 2000€ per night and after filling out multiple reports it is still online.

travel,Does anyone do video/pic walk-throughs and/or check for bed bugs upon arrival to a hotel room or Airbnb?,"I watched an Airbnb ""horror stories"" documentary recently and got a bit paranoid. Does anyone document the state of the hotel/airbnb upon arrival and departure to avoid the scam of the owner charging you extra cleaning fees or damage? Is that a common scam?


I've read what a nightmare bedbugs are to get rid of if you get them, and how often hotels/airbnbs get bedbugs, does anyone check for bedbugs right when they arrive? Would just a magnifying glass suffice or are there easier ways of checking? 


I've never done either and never had an issue, but I'm starting to do some extensive traveling starting next year so the risks/chances are higher than it's been in the past.

travel,Airbnb host is asking money after the trip,"So me and my friend accidentally took the keys with us when we checked out and we only noticed we had them when we arrived in the next destination(which was around 1.5 hours away). We messaged the host about it and asked her if she knew a way we could send them back to her and she suggested us to mail them. She was pressuring us a lot because she had no other copies. The next day( Monday) we spent 10 euros to mail the keys to her through the fastest service(1 day), so they have probably arrived on Tuesday, but thing is the host says she wasn't home when the courier came as she is working 8-4. She says she can only go on Saturday to pick them up because post office is closed when she finishes work. I suggested her to find someone to pick them up for her. She says noone she knows can do that as they are also working, she says she has had to give guests after us a refund for not having keys and she will do the same for those coming on Friday, as it is a huge incovenience. She says copying them costs more than 200 euros as they are special keys(which sounds bizarre). Now she has sent me a refund request of 50 euros. I honestly think that our business is done once we mailed her the keys and it is her responsibility to get them. Also, she is supposed to have an extra copy just in case anyway. Idk if I should deactivate the account(or empty the card I booked with), I'm afraid airbnb might charge me  unfairly.

Edit: I meant to say she claims to have given her guests a discount for the inconvenience, she hasn't actually cancelled any of her bookings.",0,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/vzsvcu/airbnb_host_is_asking_money_after_the_trip/,2022-07-15 16:29:12,Airbnb
travel,AirBnB listings from third party sites?,"So me and some friends are looking to book a holiday to the Balkans for the summer on quite a limited budget. We've been looking on airbnb and have found a good looking place that suits our budget. The thing is that it's listed by a third party site called Novasol, and they've only recently posted the listing so it has no reviews yet. The host profile has several reviews for other locations and a good star rating (\~4.5/5) but has recently posted a lot of new listings and we're not sure what to think of it. The flat is also really quite cheap, and I've reverse image searched it and the pictures don't belong to anyone else but it makes me slightly unsure about the place

travel,The day I was almost murdered senselessly in Vietnam,"**\[STORY UPDATED\]** \- **4/7. UPDATE IS AT THE VERY BOTTOM** (if you already read the story)**.**

\-----------------------------------

I still haven't told my family this story, as it would give them even more anxiety about my safety on my travels. I haven't posted about it publicly online either, as I don't run a blog on my site or use social media actively. So I guess this Reddit post is the first time, since that happened in early 2019.

I was traveling in South East Asia, and was in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). Since I typically spend at least a month at each destination, I stay almost exclusively at Airbnb apartments. This time, however, I decided to go to Ho Chi Minh from a neighboring country at the last minute. So I didn't have time to find a good apartment.

Before I secured one I wanted, I stayed at a small hotel for some days. The hotel had 2 to 3 rooms on each floor. When you walk up the stairs, there's one on the far left, and one on the far right.

The first few days, I stayed on the 4th floor - on the right. The manager, who was a really cool guy asked if I wanted to move to the 5th floor, as that room is better. I did, and this time around, my room was on the left. <- This is where it inadvertently got tricky.

After a long night out one day, I returned around 5 am. The manager was at the lobby, and we said hello briefly, and I headed up the stairs (no elevator). I got to the 5th floor, but instead of going left to my new room, I went right, because I was used to going right, to my old room. I had some drinks earlier that night, but nothing to impair my senses. I wasn't intoxicated at all.

I got to the door, took out my keys and tried to stick it in. It wouldn't go in at all. I thought, ""hmm, that's weird."" I looked at the key to make sure it wasn't broken, or perhaps something stuck on it. I tried it again - same result. It was a narrow key, and not the kind you can see into the room through a key hole.

I rubbed a finger on the key hole to see if there was something blocking it or stuck in it. I bent over and moved my head close to the key hole to inspect it, and try one last time before going down to check with the manager. In trying to insert the key again, there was a deafening.. BOOM!! And a stiff wood crack on the door, about 1-2 inches from my left ear. It was followed by a strong smell of lead. (**EDIT**: *To clarify, I'm talking about the smell of gun powder or similar substance here, as lead is odorless. Also, the gun was certainly home made, or it would have penetrated a wood door*).

In that instant, everything fell into place, and I had one of those classic ""my life flashed before me"" moments. Shit! I just accidentally tried to open someone else's door, and their first and only reaction was to shoot at the door.

It was so surreal, that all I did was turn around, walk across to my actual room and open it. I took this picture, as I was about to close the door. That vertical crack is where the bullet tried to exit.

https://preview.redd.it/cas5oiofhlr61.jpg?width=2368&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4e6f2f1a64d47c435a50cc5f86bca6233d3abd9

&#x200B;

I climbed into my bed and went to sleep, in a slightly bewildered ""what the hell just happened?"" state.

I woke up around noon and went down to the lobby. I saw the manager there, and he went ""hey man, what happened this morning?"" I told him I went to the wrong door, tried my key and I think someone shot at the door, so I realized it wasn't my room.

He told me all kinds of authorities were at the hotel that morning, because the people in that room called them. They told the cops that someone came to their door and was trying to break it down, and was kicking the door and whatnot. Obviously, that was a lie and just them trying to justify their extremely irresponsible and potentially fatal overreaction.

He told me he knew what had happened, so he told the cops not to come bother me in my room, because he was there when I returned. He said he had figured that I went to the wrong door, before going to my room. And all that talk about someone kicking and trying to break their door was just ridiculous. There are cameras at the hotel, so it was easy to verify that, even if he didn't figure it out on his own.

He said the people (who were foreigners) yelled a lot, cursed loudly at him, and made him refund all their payments. He said the bullet severely shattered the door on the inside. Somehow, it didn't make the clean exit it attempted to. That bullet exit path would have been right through my head, and effectively the end of me.

I'm guessing it was a very small hand gun. One easily concealable in a country like Vietnam, where it's very illegal to own firearms. The wood on the door was also pretty solid. If it was a hollow wood door, this would've been a very different story, or no story at all. As I'd be resting six feet under right now, with a hole in my skull.

I don't know how or why the authorities didn't detain them for being in possession of a firearm. I'm guessing they found a way to pass off the bullet damage as something else, or hid it from them. And since the manager would rather avoid the trouble with the authorities for his hotel, he let them slide. Can't blame him there.

Till this day, I can't figure how one would be as insecure in a foreign country as to react like that. A normal person would first yell ""WHO IS THERE?"" to alert the person that there's someone in there. And if the situation gets out of hand, with impending threat to their safety, they can react to defend themselves.

Accidentally going to a wrong door is a common enough occurrence in hotels, that someone should at least consider that possibility first. My attempts to open the wrong door with my key were as quiet as that can be done. I wasn't drunk or anything, and I'm generally a calm person. So it's not like I was being rowdy about trying to open the door.

Their first and only reaction was to pull out a gun and fire it at the door, with potential intent to kill. I don't know if these people were on the run from someone out to get them, and felt the need to be John Wick wherever they went. However, it was completely uncalled for, and an irresponsible overreaction, especially in a foreign country.

They told the authorities the person was trying to break down their door to rob them. So, imagine if that bullet had killed me, and that's the story they were sticking with. The headlines you guys would've seen on TV and online would have read:

**""American Man Killed in Vietnam, Trying To Rob Fine Tourists in a Hotel""**

And my family would've had to live with the shame and uncertainty of not knowing if their son and brother truly went and became a robber in Asia.

Either way, I'm happy it didn't get to that, and I'm still here to tell this story today. Stay safe on your travels. Has anyone experienced something like this on the road?

**EDIT**: To add this rough video made a day or two after, when I was checking out from the hotel. I have removed the audio, as it was only a quick video ramble to one of my buddies, explaining what had happened with the shooting incident. It doesn't really offer additional context to the story, just additional visuals of the scene.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT 2 (4/7):** For the sake of a few people in the comments who have their doubts about this story.I might have had doubts about it too, if I wasn't the one who experienced it. That said..

I'm not sure if the mods care enough to verify this story, but for the mods: Feel free to send me a message.  I'll give you the hotel details, contact, date it happened, and the manager's name. You can contact them and attempt to verify it. Hell, I'll be happy to be on a conference call with you, to make sure he is willing to discuss it at all. It's a family run hotel, so he should still be there.

There is no way the manager would have been on my side after the fact, if I had indeed caused a ""ruckus"" which made their actions remotely justifiable. Remember, there were cameras in the hotel.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT 3 (4/7) - (STORY UPDATE):**  I was responding to someone in the comments here, looked up something and stumbled on an old reddit post of someone else. That reddit post and the account behind it may or may not be linked to this story.

The person in the comments here was doubting the plausibility of someone in Vietnam putting together a home made gun, smuggling one in or concealing it. So I did a quick search which returned this reddit post:   


[https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/8wrcuu/where\_can\_i\_find\_a\_place\_which\_sell\_guns\_airsoft/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/8wrcuu/where_can_i_find_a_place_which_sell_guns_airsoft/)

What stuck out most: That post is from the same time I was there 2 years ago. The poster said they arrived HCM (Saigon) that day and are staying at a **hotel on the** **SAME STREET** as mine. What are the odds?

That sent me down a mini rabbit hole into his reddit posts, and I'm not saying this is the person in question, but their interests and identical location at the time fit the profile perfectly. Look at his posts from the same period 2 years ago, asking how to smuggle weapons into Vietnam:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9z7r3a/how\_can\_you\_smuggle\_weapons\_to\_vietnam/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/9z7r3a/how_can_you_smuggle_weapons_to_vietnam/)

Look at at some of his posts about the home made guns and weapons he has put together.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/somethingimade/comments/8q1hlv/i\_made\_a\_semiauto\_rubberband\_rifle\_and\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/somethingimade/comments/8q1hlv/i_made_a_semiauto_rubberband_rifle_and_a/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/homemade\_weapons/comments/86arfz/although\_this\_subreddit\_is\_dead\_i\_would\_like\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/homemade_weapons/comments/86arfz/although_this_subreddit_is_dead_i_would_like_to/)

  
If you scroll through that person's profile, you will also see the really disturbing posts they've made (which I won't link to here). Many of those posts suggests a mentally unstable person, into very shady stuff, who also likes to make home made guns and weapons. This is the kind of person I imagine would fire a home made gun at a hotel door, without uttering a warning.

So even if this isn't the person (and it likely isn't), just be aware that people like this are out there, and won't hesitate to put their home made guns and weapons to work. The same way the person on the other side of that door did.

I have no real personal interest in finding the person behind that door, or reporting them to authorities. I just wanted to tell this story exactly as it happened, and nothing more.",2263,214,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/mli9dn/the_day_i_was_almost_murdered_senselessly_in/,2021-04-06 18:26:46,Airbnb

travel,11 days in France: An in-depth review,"American here (31M, Los Angeles). I visited France for 11 days last October on a solo trip. This was my first visit to France and I wanted to share my experience.

I stayed at Airbnbs in the following cities, traveling by train and bus:

**Paris, Pt. 1** (3 nights) – I started and ended the trip here, so I’m breaking it into two parts. This city more than lives up to the hype. Every corner has unique charms, yet the Haussmannian architecture brings a unified magic to it all. I stayed in the 18th Arrondissement. Loved the vibrant and quirky Montmartre neighborhood. Walking up the steps to Sacré-Cœur jet-lagged through the rain is a memory I’ll never forget.

* **Highlights:** Eiffel Tower (it really is special), Sacré-Cœur, Panthéon, Rodin Museum, Luxembourg Garden
* **Day Trip: Chartres –** Chartres Cathedral is stunning. I kept grinning at the exterior and my jaw dropped at the massive ceilings and blue stained-glass windows. The surrounding city is cute and makes the cathedral feel even more massive.

**Rouen** (1 night) – Visited for the cathedral and Joan of Arc history, but was blown away by the well-preserved/restored medieval architecture throughout the city. Delightful place to just stroll and admire your surroundings.

* **Highlights:** Rouen Cathedral (spectacular), Saint-Maclou Church, Saint-Ouen Abbey, Joan of Arc Church
* **Day Trip: Caen** – Stopped through on a train layover to Bayeux, so I only had a couple hours here. Really interesting city. Felt heavily shaped by WWII bombings with later-period architecture than other Normandy cities. William the Conqueror’s Castle was neat to explore.

**Bayeux** (2 nights) – Warm and charming. The Battle of Normandy Museum is outstanding. The War Cemetery and Journalists’ Memorial were really emotionally compelling too. I walked away with a much deeper appreciation of WWII history.

* **Highlights:** Bayeux Cathedral, Battle of Normandy Museum, Bayeux Tapestry Museum
* **Day Trip: Mont-St-Michel** (via [Bayeux Shuttle](https://www.bayeuxshuttle.com/)) – Surreal. Looks like it fell out of God’s snow globe. The surrounding landscape adds to the dreaminess. One of the first sights I booked for the trip. So glad I saw it.

**Tours** (2 nights) – Very pleasant, friendly student population. Great blend of modern and historical buildings. Had some of my best meals of the trip here (L’Appart Côte Terre, La Dentelle, Hansel et Gretel).

* **Highlights:** Tours Cathedral, Charlemagne’s Tower, St. Martin’s Basilica
* **Day Trip: Loire Valley Châteaux** (via [Touraine Evasion](https://www.tourevasion.com/en/loire-valley-chateaux-excursions/))
   * **Amboise** – Lots of interesting details in the roof, walls, and landscaping. Excellent views of the Loire River and surrounding town.
   * **Chenonceau** – The pinnacle of beauty. So much to love between the castle interior, exterior, gardens, setting, and history. One of my favorite parts of the trip.
   * **Cheverny** – Elegant and stately. Outstandingly preserved interiors, with whimsical seasonal decorations (acorns, stuffed squirrels, etc.).
   * **Chambord** – Huge and impressive. Got lost amid the many rooms and symmetrical designs. Would love to return once roof restorations are complete.

**Paris, Pt. 2** (3 nights) – Stayed in the 11th Arrondissement. Didn’t get to explore it as much as the 18th (which I preferred), but it seemed like a younger, newer vibe. The Place de La Bastille and nearby Marais district were cool.

* **Highlights:** Louvre, Sainte-Chappelle, Catacombs, Notre-Dame Cathedral (look forward to seeing inside post-repairs)
* **Day Trip: Versailles** – Worth seeing the palace for the opulence, but a bit much. Crowds frustrating. Enjoyed the calmer Trianon Estate, Marie Antoinette’s hamlet, and palace gardens at sunset.

**Food & Drink Thoughts:**

* French bakeries are top-notch. Almond croissant and pain suisse were my favorites.
* Loved the galettes and the variety of toppings. My favorite was at Moulin de la Galette in Bayeux – elemental and Camembert cheeses with Andouille sausage and baked apples.
* The restaurant at Chenonceau serves an excellent roast duck.
* Amazing desserts. Favorites were the pistachio macaron glacé, crème brûlée, and panna cotta (I know this is Italian, but the one I had at L’Appart Côte Terre in Tours was *so* good).
* Chinon red and Cassis wines in the Loire Valley were great!
* Café culture is very charming and relaxing. Loved people-watching and writing in my travel journal while sipping coffee or finishing a meal.

**General Thoughts:**

* The French are kind and helpful. Negative stereotypes about them being “rude” are completely unfounded. 98% of interactions I had were positive, and the rest I would attribute to customer service fatigue and not take personally.
* Despite not speaking French in 13 years (I studied it in high school), I tried to use it whenever possible. People seemed appreciative, even if I didn’t get words right or had to switch to English.
* Autumn is a wonderful time to visit France. The fall foliage is especially pretty in Paris and Normandy. Weather was mostly sunny or partly cloudy, only one rainy day. Temperatures were low 60s to mid 70s (°F) during the day, and pleasantly cool at night. The French claimed it was unusually warm for October though.
* Smoking is much more common than in the US and took some getting used to.
* French train system is fantastic. Strikes can be stressful though, especially if your pre-purchased ticket type isn’t transferrable between cancellations (only happened once).
* Paris Metro is very convenient, but walking any given street of Paris is a feast for the senses.
* Seeing and hearing other people excited about the Eiffel Tower in various languages made the experience even cooler.
* *The Coronation of Napoleon* and *Winged Victory* were my favorite works at the Louvre. The crowds around *Mona Lisa* are kind of nuts, but she’s deservedly famous. The quieter upper galleries were a welcome break, lots of great works there too.
* Going to the Panthéon on a quiet Sunday morning and standing feet from the remains of people who changed the world is a powerful experience.
* France is a gorgeous, incredible country. I’m so grateful I got to see it. Can’t wait to return and explore its many other beautiful regions (Dordogne, Provence, Grand Est, etc.). If any French people are reading this, thank you for making an American feel welcome!

**Budget:**

* Total: $3000
   * Flight: $900 (LAX to CGD, round-trip)
   * Airbnbs: $1250 (Paris more expensive than smaller cities)
   * Train/Bus Tickets Between Cities: $130 (bought in advance)
   * Daily Expenses: $720 (food, sight/tour admissions, Metro fares, etc.)

travel,Roadtrip in Zimbabwe ,"My husband and I spent a few months traveling in Africa, with Zimbabwe being our fifth country on the trip. We spent 14 days in late May/early June, and fell deeply in love with the country and it's people. We rented a car and spent 10 days driving here: 
- 1 night in Harare 
- 3 nights in Eastern Highlands 
- 3 nights in Gonarezhou National Park
- 2 nights by Great Zimbabwe Ruins 
Then took an overnight Greyhound bus cross-country from Harare to Victoria Falls, and capped it off with 2 nights at the falls. Wish we'd allocated more time to Zim, it's an awesome place.  

Ended up being our second favorite country after Namibia (out of 10 total). Its obvious that Zimbabwe had hit a failed state status, but seems to be making progress on rising out of that. Tons of construction to repave or build new roads, zero police bribing (something that was prevalent), and they even have KFC which feels promising! Based on what I'd read online from older forums we were expecting far worse conditions and were genuinely surprised at the current state of things. Money was the primary logistical nightmare for us - they use USD which can be pulled at every ATM...if your bank let's you. Chase was not a fan so ended up being a huge headache. We were only able to use credit cards in a few spots in Harare and Vic Falls.

We rented a car from a small family business in Harare, total fucking beater but we drove on some seriously shitty 4x4 roads out in the highlands and it did its job. It was great to have in Gonarezhou where we did self drive safari, just kept to the main roads and had an awesome time. The majority of the roads in Zim are in good condition, but when they're not they are terrible (like an hour driving on washboard, slowly losing my sanity). 

Safety was a non-issue, we never felt unsafe at any point on our trip. 

Used a mix of Airbnb, direct bookings, and booking.com for hotels. Scanning Google Maps in specific locations turned out to be a good idea for finding hotels that aren't on the bigger websites, found a couple of gems that way. If going to Vic Falls I would stay on the Zim side vs Zambia. 

Our esims sucked ass, if going get a physical sim card in Harare. ",1077,32,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gf07i8,2024-10-29 17:26:47,Airbnb
travel,Should I choose Airbnb (with free parking) or a hotel (with included breakfast) for my one-week tourist visit to Istanbul?," 

I am planning to visit Istanbul with my wife. I speak Turkish and have been to Istanbul many times before when I was single (didn't care where I stayed or ate). Now, we want to rent a car to travel and see the sights. Additionally, we want to have a nice Turkish breakfast in the mornings.

The issue is that most hotels are located in the city center and either have no parking or charge for parking nearby. However, they do offer nice breakfasts.

On the other hand, if we choose Airbnb, it might be a bit on the periphery of the city, with ample free parking space. However, breakfast is not included, and we would need to get it at nearby restaurants. Are there any good and affordable restaurants that offer a quality breakfast buffet similar to hotel breakfast?

I understand that in either option, I will have to pay extra (either for parking or for breakfast), but I don't know which is wiser. I am really confused and don't know which option to choose.

travel,Perspectives of an AirBnB host - Something everyone should consider before deciding to stay at an AirBnB,"\*Please note that this is just based on my experience in the recent months. I just needed to put ""pen to paper"" as a cathartic release. I love 99% of my guests and am a superhost who normally receive 4/5 star reviews. My advise on the bottom of the page, is just that, advise. You can take it or not. As a host we have no ""recourse"" if we get a bad reviews simply because someone didn't bother to read our listing in its entirety. While hosting is only a supplemental income for me (I live in a very high cost of living area), for some it is their lively hood. If they are great hosts and have put everything out there up-front before you book, they deserve the courtesy of an accurate review.

I have been renting a room in my home for almost 5 years now. When I first started to host on AirBnB it was a great way to meet new people, provide affordable accommodations and bring in a little extra money. Every little bit helps. I don't charge anywhere near a hotel, due to more competition in my area with other hosts, my rates are very competitive. Over the past year or so I have started to question whether the additional income is really worth the headaches. Keep in mind that my perspective is from someone renting a room in the same home with which I live. It’s a different experience than those who rent entire properties.

One of the things that has started to surface in the past year or two, is how entitled some people feel when staying in another persons home. Mind you, this does not apply to everyone. There are some fantastic guests out there, they outnumber the bad ones. Yet it’s those bad eggs that sour your experience. This is the case for hosts as well as guests. It goes both ways.

In my experience, some guests seem to be of the mind that your house is a hotel and they can check in at any time of night. I have to be up early for work, so I ask that guests check in by 8 or at least check with me if a later arrival is ok. I am usually accommodating if asked. As a guest it would never occur to me to rent a room in someones home and then show up at 11pm at night with no communication beforehand. A hotel, yes, a private residence, no. Especially when your listing states your check-in hours end at a specific time? Please read the “fine print,” it’s not even fine print. It’s right there for everyone to see.

Some think because you have given them access to a room and bathroom in your home, that they are entitled to use everything. For example, the kitchen. If a host does not list the an area as an amenity, then no, you are not entitled to access that area. Do not make an assumption that it is just ok to do what you please. Most hosts, at least I hope most hosts, are accommodating if asked. I really have no issues with giving guests access to places not listed as an amenity, I just want to be asked.

We seem to have migrated into the age of entitlement, Where common courtesy and respect are a thing of the past (and yes, I know there have always been people like this out there). AirBnB is supposed to be a service that benefits both parties, but that only happens if both parties have mutual respect for one another. A host is trying to supplement their income and a guest is trying to save a little money. As hosts, we do everything we can to make sure our guests have a good experience in our home. We clean, we provide amenities, we open our homes up to complete strangers. Becoming a host is not a decision that is taken lightly, at least when it comes to letting someone into the home you live in.

As a guest please try to appreciate that you are receiving lower cost accommodations that in-turn give you more spending freedom during your travels. If you aren't receiving a much lower rate than a hotel, I don't know what to tell you. I personally search multiple sites for accommodations when traveling and pick the one that works best for me. You, as a guest, make the choice to stay at a particular location, that is your right. You make the choice to stay at someone’s home rather than a hotel. It is the hosts responsibility to ensure you have a safe, clean and pleasant place to stay. It is the guests responsibility not to take advantage of the hosts hospitality, and follow the guidelines that they have set forth. Guidelines, that you as a guest, should have read before booking. When you book to stay at a particular home, you are agreeing to the terms set out by the host.

We understand that sometimes crap happens that is outside of your control. In general, I am a pretty easy going person. It actually takes a lot to rile me up. However, when a guest gives a lower than stellar review, over things that are very clearly laid out in the listing, that is going to get me riled up. Yes, there are some hosts out there who may try to be deceptive in their descriptions, but most of us strive to provide the most accurate listing we can. It is important to us, that you can be confident in your expectations. Please, before leaving your host a review, make sure you have read and re-read the listing description, so that your review is fair and accurate.

So for those of you who are looking to utilize services like AirBnB during your travels, keep the following in mind…

1: Read the listing from top to bottom and everything in-between

2: Follow the rules of the house, be courteous to your host(s). Don’t show up to someones home at 11pm at night. If you plan to have a late arrival like that, check with the host before booking or stay at a 24hr hotel.

3: Let your host know if something doesn’t meet your expectations, give them a chance to make it right

4: Most importantly, please be fair and accurate in your review. Read and re-read the listing so that you do not give a negative review for something that you would have already been aware of had you bothered to read the listing to start with.",5,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/d9ktru/perspectives_of_an_airbnb_host_something_everyone/,2019-09-26 15:02:19,Airbnb

I wanted to know your experience and suggestions.

travel,"Hostels, hotels, and Airbnbs.","I’m turning 40 before the euro trip and its a first time trip.  It’s me and another single guy, and perhaps a third, at least for a week.  Flexible plan is Barcelona, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Prague.    


What are your opinions on hostels? It seems like the price is similar to a hotel or more than an Airbnb if getting a private room.  Many have meals and group events that single guys like us would probably appreciate.

I have the feeling that they’d take less on off season the night of stay, but could be totally off there.  Prices are high like 150-250 a night for a private room at least in Barcelona, which is the first stop, 3 months in advance.

The age restriction is 18-45 at most Hostels.  We are are single and young at heart, but would probably prefer a private sleeping area.

The airbnbs seem like the best deal, but the socializing and food of the hostels are appealing.     


Any advice for rooming for single guys who are both young and old.

travel,Italy with a 5 & 10 yo,"Traveling from US with two kids, a husband and two bags .  Florence , Bologna, Venice, Naples, & Rome for 16 days in December with two months of planning . 

the things I thought would be issues were not at all. The flights were easy ( the FA allowed us to use the blow up foot stools and we slept ) . The kids were never bored and loved the food . The minimal luggage could have been even further reduced as we wore the same things and used the washers at the airbnbs . Not a single drop of rain. Time change wasn’t a problem . No issues with pick pockets or ever feeling unsafe . 

The things we didn’t consider : restaurants closing midday until after 7/8 pm. Getting incredibly sick  and navigating the medication regulation, lack of air circulation in the airbnbs and no remotes to cool the rooms, the mosquitos that would come in through open windows, and the 5 yo becoming trapped in a bathroom for an hour in Florence due to the lock failing . The shock from waiters when we’d ask for butter noodles for the 5 yo .  Just a natural learning curve with traveling and nothing was really an issue . We very quickly realized these were simply normal for the country ( apart from the trapped child ) 

July of 2009 Italy was a vastly different place. The crowds at Vatican, Colosseum, Pompei , Venice were non existent then. I have so many photos of the same places and it’s a small amount of people around. We just showed up to the Vatican and walked around without any previous bookings . Same for the other locations . This time we were shoulder to shoulder at times in a crowd that barely moved and dodging selfie arms suddenly appearing every 3 feet . 

As a side note myself and the two kids are vegetarian and had zero problems finding great food . Bologna felt more meat heavy at the restaurants we chose.",1244,82,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1936ugs,2024-01-10 12:09:34,Airbnb

travel,AirBnB host charged me instead of providing a refund,"Currently in Italy. 

Our Airbnb apartment is lovely. It's well-appointed and spacious. It has signs of age (i.e. radiator won't turn off in one bedroom, wifi is inconsistent and only works on phones, not computers. We must take trash down the street to the local church and it's unclear where to leave it, etc). These things are not a huge deal TBH even though no/inconsistent wifi is tough.

The host has requested we communicate via What's app, which I've heard is a not allowed. 

The problem lies in that we canceled one night and the host offered to refund the fees for one night (out of 7). Instead of providing a refund, they charged us $50 vs. refunding us $289 ($289 = one nightly rate, no fees).  

If it comes to worst-case scenario, can we just charge back the extra night on our credit card? t have not yet heard back. Previously he was very responsive. Is there anything we should do between now and then?

travel,"Use AirBnB at your own risk, or how I lost 3000EUR","I booked a 1 month trip in Spain (an amazing country with great people 99.9% of the time, nothing to do with AirBnb being indifferent) and I really didn't took the cheapest offering, I actually paid through the nose because I thought I was getting something with more than decent comfort as we had to stay  about 1 month.

When we got to the place, it wasn't as described, it wasn't that clean, heating was missing even though listing said it did, it was noisy at night and with windows closed cold and noise came in easily, we had to use up all the blankets to barely make it through the night, but the place being on a noisy street and cheap windows meant we could here everyone on the street passing by, which was quite often into the night.

We had enough after a few days the cold in the night got unbearable, and because my wife is pregnant , we couldn't afford risking her health, so I took proof of the cold and noise problems, looked for an alternative accommodation, **this time on Booking**, and then we informed AirBnb we had to leave the listing as it a health risk (we waked up coughing from the cold, and my wife is pregnant) and because the listing wasn't as described (which was cozy, quiet, etc).

In several years of using AirBnb we've been down this road of being scammed just once, a few years ago, in the US, and they were very helpful.

We would soon realise AirBnb has changed a lot since then.

**I called AirBnb, told them the situation we were through, and the person on the other line kept going on like a robot about their cancellation policy (meaning no refund) while I was telling her the listing posed a health risk for my pregnant wife and isn't as described and I can prove it, so I told her it can't possibly be a standard situation as it was a scam and  not only allowed it to happen but didn't seem to care and investigate and make the listing more accurate.**

She told me in a cold and indifferent tone that I need to confront the owner (which didn't speak English) and ask him to refund me and then open a case with AirBnB, which I did. This was about a week into my 1 month stay, and we weren't at the property anymore as we paid for another place because we were desperate to get some decent sleep. So at this point we paid for 2 accommodations, as AirBnB didn't refund us even if we told them we left the place and the owner has the keys (of course when confronted he didn't care and didn't agree to a refund when the place was clean and empty for another 3-4 weeks and I'm sure **he even rented it out without AirBnb knowing to double his jackpot)**

With the AirBnb issue opened and proof sent, someone was assigned about after a few days (!). Everything in the conversation with the support person being assigned was standard canned response once every few days like ""Please allow us to verify the proof"" ""Please allow us to contact the host"" like if I was stopping this somehow.

**And now at the ""investigation end"" they came back with ""sorry, no refund, owner didn't agree"". But nothing about how I've proven (by photos and videos) that the listing is nothing like the pictures and description (no heating) and they didn't even reimburse me for the several weeks we didn't stay.**

**TLDR: if you get scammed on AirBnB**, even if you have proof of how it's described inaccurately by the owner, AirBnb not only takes weeks to ""investigate"" while you would have to live somewhere else, but at the end **they side with the owner** and you don't see a dime back for the period you aren't staying in the s\*\*thole you ended up unknowingly renting.

**Best part is because AirBnB cancelled the reservation on my behalf (again with no refund), I can't leave a review so other people will be scammed in the future by this guy, and AirBnb won't lift a finger.**",3,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ukxrr4/use_airbnb_at_your_own_risk_or_how_i_lost_3000eur/,2022-05-08 09:02:43,Airbnb

I called the booking services after booking through their website to inform them my flight would arrive at 10:30 PM local time and I could check in as late as 1 AM. They happily put down a note saying late check in to avoid any random fees. Furthermore, without me asking, they asked if I had any room specifications. They said they could happily book me to a room on a higher level away from elevators. They then recommended some good spots in Vegas and told me they can make special reservations in MGM hotel restaurants. They were very nice, kind and accommodating, a big surprise to me after going with AirBnb for a couple of years.

My flight then got cancelled. Stupid Air Canada couldn’t find the staff to fly the plane. I quickly called Luxor to let them know. They immediately removed one nights stay from my booking without even me asking. They said I wouldn’t be charged for the room and they can waive the early check in fee as well. I have never seen or heard such an accommodating and helpful establishment, anywhere. When I arrived at the check in, they did as they said. No charge for the missed night and mo early check in fees.

That left four of us who cheap by frugal by nature who generally do things like: splitting meals, limiting booze, deserts or fancy appetizers.  The four frugal people were forced to spend more than our fair share when the dinner bills were split ten ways equally.

travel,Do you have any part of the world that you have traveled to where things never seem to work out?,"For context, I'm now I'm on my 4th trip to Mexico that has either been cut short or ended terribly. I think it would make all of us to feel better to build solidarity by sharing our unfortunate stories. :)

1. First ever trip to Mexico: Traveled (or tried to) to Ensenada, Cabo, and Vallarta via cruse ship for a long weekend. Second day of the trip I came down with a severe illness which resulted in fever, lethargy, endless vomiting and diarrhea. Completely missed the ALL PORTS and felt like I was going to die. Ended up being on the ship for the duration of the journey and did not leave at all except to be checked out by the ship doctor.
2. Decided to give Mexico another try and did a short trip to Tijuana and Rosarito. The airbnb I had booked was located in an area with literal ROCKS poorly mixed in with cement which resulted in my tire bursting. Was an extreme pain to deal with trying to work things out with Mexican car insurance and getting the tire fixed. If that wasn't enough, I AGAIN succumbed to illness. Fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Pretty sure I had some really bad food poisoning. I was incapacitated the whole trip and barely felt better enough to head back when it was time to go home.
3. You thought I would have learned by now, right? WRONG. Decided that 3rd time would be the charm and planned a trip to Mexico City. I had heard SO MANY good things about the city and this was going to be my first solo trip ever! Well, the universe had other plans for me. I was able to have one full day of fun (Pyramids, nice dinner experience, jazz bar) BUT THEN, second night (WHAT IS UP WITH THE SECOND DAY), I AGAIN, come down with fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Except I was alone this time. Finally got my ass to a hospital where I was admitted overnight for fluids and medication. Last day I wake up feeling good enough to get on my flight home and WHAT HAPPENS? Volcanic eruption, grounding ALL FLIGHTS. I shit you not. I was trapped at the airport all night waiting for some kind of relief but ended up stuck in the airport overnight as all nearby hotels had been booked due to the eruption. Luckily I had purchased travel insurance so all my nonrefundables were reimbursed but I was so bummed I missed out on the rest of my itinerary. I had so much planned :(.
4. Last but not least, traveled to Tulum for a bachelor party. I think you know where this is going. Nope not this time! Wasn't ill at all, finally! But the universe wasn't going to let me off that easy. We had decided on a popular beach club and things were going great until a fucking shooting sent everyone running. It awful. The most terrified I have ever been in my life. I won't go further but we cut our trip short and got on the next flights home to finish off a short celebration for the groom. I won't lie, I'm still pretty fucked up from the experience and I think I have now finally accepted that the Universe does not want me in Mexico.

It's so unfortunate that I have had all this bad luck. Mexico is much easier to travel to for a fun time but I am clearly not meant for that experience lol. Looks like I'll be sticking to Asia where I have much better luck!!!

travel,"Airbnb in 2022 - making ""host"" happy is the top priority","Just chatted with a few Airbnb support - apparently a host could break into their own home while the guests are there or disrupt them in any sort of ways during their stays, and there is nothing Airbnb could do, the host will keep all the money, and the guests just have to deal with it. Welcome to Airbnb 2022.

&#x200B;

Here is my story:

TLDR(sorta) - someone banged repeatedly on our door around 12am asking for host. Host did not reply till 6pm the next day, so we booked a new Airbnb and he refused to refund for those days we left. AirBnb said nothing could be done.

&#x200B;

While we were sleeping, at around 12am a stranger was banging on the front door and turning the doorknob repeatedly for 15-30mins shouting the host's name speaking the local language(we are foreigners so we couldn't understand). We thought it was a debt collector. To remind you again it was 12am, we are in a foreign country sleeping and someone was banging on the door. We felt very uneasy and frightened of course. So we tried to get in touch with the host during that time saying there is someone outside calling for you but received no response. Then I tried to get in touch with him again the whole next day, but still nothing. Because of how uneasy we felt at the place and we didn't want to wait for don't know how long to get a response from the host as all the Airbnb at that time were already over $400/night except one, we decided the best course of action before the sun goes down in a foreign city was to move to another Airbnb, which we did thankfully. Then the host responded at 6pm saying it was a neighbor mistakenly asking for his girlfriend to open the door which we don't believe as the guy was clearly calling the host's name. So basically we paid for 2 Airbnb during the same period, and asked the host for a refund for the days we moved to another Airbnb but he refused. I contacted Airbnb, they said they have contacted the host and said nothing could be done. I am definitely hoping Airbnb could refund me but the last resort is to do a Chargeback. Want to hear you guys opinion on this matter if I am being reasonable or not.

Thank you!

For 3 people or private room a hostel is no longer the cheapest option (sometimes more expensive). 

I wonder what the recommendations are for a group of three in the cities we are hitting (Paris, London, Amsterdam). My thoughts:

Hostel: Usually cheaper, not exactly the case in a group though. Easy to make friends with others who are also traveling in the city. I know it is a popular option for other young travelers.

Hotel: Many amenities and we have our own space. Many services like holding bags or cleaning rooms/laundry. Convenience

AirBnb: Get a taste of living in a community and culture but can be a bit more expensive in the best areas.

travel,Alternatives to AirBnb and Vrbo?,"I had a couple of bad experiences with Airbnb between 2019 and 2020 where I lost not only a lot of money but a huge amount of time trying to address the issues and just tearing my hair out with their terrible ""customer service"", and I decided I was done with them. I did also have some good experiences but the gamble and the time/money lost on the bad ones didn't make it worth it. However, I did still have a small credit that sat in my account and so this year, as I was planning some travel, I booked a place thinking ""Eh, what the hell, it looks nice"". Still haven't gone to that place yet, still crossing my fingers. 

Then this week I needed to vacate my apartment for a few days and thought it would be a nice opportunity to go for a retreat of sorts. I booked a place that seemed nice, and now that I'm here I'm realizing it's not at all a good fit and very overpriced for what it is. The ""bad fit"" aspect is partially my fault - I should have been more diligent with the research as I thought I'd be within walking distance of hiking trails and I'm not, so I'm just stuck sitting and working in the garden when I had planned on hiking. But the garden is also not quiet, lots of neighbors working, dogs barking etc, which of course the host can do nothing about, but I feel like someone could have mentioned this in the reviews. 

And that brings me to what makes Airbnb suck: the overpricing, the misrepresentation, and how difficult it is to leave an honest review. Now that I'm here, seeing how the room is, what features are available, how incredibly uncomfortable the mattress is (she probably bought this thing in the 60s), I'm realizing that for the same price it would have been far more worth it to get a nice hotel room. But the truth is that I don't want to say these things in a review because the host is a very sweet, welcoming older lady. And this is probably why reviews are so completely unreliable, and this is very much part of the business model. You're paying more than hotel prices (in my case) but you feel like a guest and have to be as gracious and diplomatic as one, and Airbnb understands the psychology of this.

I've never used Vrbo before but read on here that they have issues as well. I'm now looking to just use booking and rely on hotels/hostels etc, and did a recent trip where that worked out great. However, how would you go about finding places that are more out in nature, where there aren't necessarily hotels?",5,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/sntuhz/alternatives_to_airbnb_and_vrbo/,2022-02-08 20:22:35,Airbnb

I booked a place for stay few months in advance. No free cancellation. Host cancelled my reservation \~16h before arrival. Airbnb offered me a coupon but everything was much, much more expensive than I originally planned. No profit :/

So I've been planning my USA trip for 6 months. The plan was complicated (we're traveling with 3 kids and my parents - 7 people), so I've booked everything in advance. I searched for places that could be cancelled as late as possible so that I could change something later on. Half of the places were booked via [Booking.com](https://Booking.com), half with Airbnb.

I've been to Philadelfia before and wanted to visit it again but I knew good neighborhood is very important in Philly. I decided to pay up front (no cancellation policy) and have a good flat in a good place. I chose:

3 days before our arrival the host contacted me and said he needs to relocate us to a different place because of the plumbing. Well - not ideal, but things happen so I agreed (the new place was in similar standard).

I contacted them 1 day before arrival. I was visiting other cities too before Philadelfia and had plans after it so I really wanted it to work because everything else was already booked (trains, apartments etc.). 

Unfortunetely after few hours they replied that they need to cancel and I should get a refund from Airbnb. Yeah, sure - everything was 2.5x more expensive now in Philadelfia so great deal :(

The support did offer me a coupon for next stay but I'd still have to pay more than I paid originally. I think they shoud cover the difference. Especially that I couldn't cancel the place myself. Why they can cancel without consequences but I can't?

travel,"Is ""booking directly with the hotel"" a very US or European thing to do or prefer?","EDIT : Not sure why the question is getting downvoted. I am asking this question purely to understand more about how our travel choices are different and if there is a cultural angle to it.

Asking this question as an Indian who is used to booking via some 3rd party and rarely directly. I travel quite a bit internationally for leisure trips and have always used [Bookin.com](http://Bookin.com), Airbnb, Agoda etc for finding and booking all accommodations on my trips. The only exceptions being when either I needed to reach out to hotel directly for some info and book with them directly coz I am on call anyway or it is a very last minute booking (let's say trying to book a room at 7pm for the night or next 2) and calling a hotel will get me a better deal coz they have spare inventory but the online or their own website's prices don't update as dynamically, so calling got me 15-20% cheaper deals. Most of my friends have very similar experiences. Flights I have always found cheaper rates with aggregators than direct airlines, even my credit card points can be used with these aggregators (example HDFC with cleartrip, goibibo etc.) unlike that in US, where I understand the banks tie-up with airlines or hotels directly.

What surprised me a lot on this sub is the no. of posts and people supporting direct booking with hotels and flights - even if the prices are may be higher by \~5-10%. I understand from the threads that you all have had few bad experiences with Expedia or [booking.com](http://booking.com) for refunds or reschedules or unexpected changes, but don't the platforms also give a lot of protection in terms of cancellation policies, reducing payment issues, getting your money back if the hotel cancels etc? These things are fairly important for me, especially if it's not a hotel chain, to consider directly booking with the hotel well in advance and paying them upfront. Do you folks not worry about these standard policies or do the hotels offer such policies anyway? I would love to book directly with hotels to put more money in their pockets but have never been able to get around these questions. Do you folks in general believe in dealing directly with business owners than with middle men, like prefer buying from a company website over Amazon etc. or this is a very specific travel related perspective because of the policies/ customer care of [booking.com](http://booking.com) or others?",79,256,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1dpoaa3/is_booking_directly_with_the_hotel_a_very_us_or/,2024-06-27 10:46:12,Airbnb

travel,We won a hefty Airbnb gift card. Where should we go?,"I apologize in advance for being this fortunate - I've never won anything in my life. My spouse and I love to travel, and we won a substantial Airbnb gift card in a raffle, so we're trying to figure out what to do with it. It's not enough to rent us a villa for six months, but it's enough to cover housing more or less anywhere for ten days.

Our guidelines:

-No place where the beach is the primary thing you do once you get there. (This is my spouse's guideline, not mine. Other than this, they're a great travel partner!). We aren't overly outdoorsy but enjoy nice scenery.

-Good food is a high priority. We're adventurous eaters.

-I enjoy and look forward to long drives.

-Travel time needs to be less than 20 hours from NY or Boston. 

-Bonus points for birdwatching opportunities.

-We have enough saved to cover airfare and vehicle rental if needed, but ideally, we would like to go someplace where we can use the gift card to soak up an expense that would otherwise be insurmountable. Places you don't visit because lodging is expensive will be particularly good.

-Places we don't want to go for various reasons, mostly having gone recently: Paris, London, Russia (that ship has well and truly sailed now hasn't it), Hungary, Copenhagen, Pakistan, India, continental U.S.

-Have been considering: Driving from Tromsø to Trondheim and seeing the fjords; driving through the Chilean Andes from Santiago to Punta Arenas; seeing Buenos Aires and flying south to Patagonia; New Zealand (stretches travel time to its limit and flights are really pricey, but may be doable?); Hong Kong; Austrian Alps; Anchorage, AK; driving from Vancouver to Calgary.

travel,Host cancels one day before check-in. ,"We booked an apartment via booking 2 months before our travel. One day before check-in the owner sends a message they can not accomodate us due to prolonging of other guests. Tells us we can cancel the reservation for free. We tell them we do not want to cancel and they should be the one cancelling. I send a message to booking support, but only bot responds someone will contact us within 24 hours. Can't wait that long, so I call booking support. Answering machine tells to enter reservation number. After entering it just keeps repeating and asking for reservation number. Tried several times. After googling found out reservation number is probably too long and the machine glitches out. Can't reach booking support via phone. I tell once again the host we do not want to cancel and if there is anything we can do to keep our reservation. It's not been canceled by host and booking shows if we cancel there is a cancellation fee. Sure host says we can cancel for free but we don't want that. Hosts ignores. We search for new accomodation and book one for the next days. After staying in the new apartment 36 hours later, during the night, 1 am I have received a call from booking singapore. Was sleeping, didn't hear the call. I'd imagine they know where I am due to the reservations (Bulgaria) so it's a weird call time. Late afternoon I get a message from booking they have canceled the reservation and they wish I've found a new place to stay. After that I've sent them messages if I could leave a review for the accomodation and if there are any compensation etc. but they don't respond anything anymore.

So all in all, booking accomodations from smaller hosts via booking is a bit risky and will avoid it in the future. There is basically no penalty for the host for cancelling reservations as they want. There is no way knowing if that is a common thing the host does. At least in airbnb there is an automated review saying the host canceled the reservation. Booking support is absolutely horrible and had not known it is that bad. After reading all reviews from the accomodation there is one saying the host changed their accomodation to another apartment, so it leaves me wondering if cancelling reservations is common for this property since booking doesn't punish in any way. 

Some days later I make an invoice for the property for the late cancellation and time spent looking for the new apartment. I don't expect to be paid but it's for a reminder they have done wrong. Send jt to booking and the host. Don't get any response anymore from anyone, no wonder though.

Wanted to share our experience. What makes it even worse is that we were hiking on mountains the day before check-in and did not really have time to look for a new place to stay. For us, we definitely will prefer airbnb from now on. Thanks for reading. ",261,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fck3gz/host_cancels_one_day_before_checkin/,2024-09-09 07:54:51,Airbnb
travel,Airbnb hosts in Italy,"Has anyone been able to understand why Airbnb hosts in Italy insist on having pictures of your travel documents?

I feel like sending digital copies of personal documents to some random person’s hotmail account is not in any way a good security practice. Hosts in Italy usually claim that they need to register the guest with the local police. In that case why can’t I just send the data in my travel documents? Passports contain way more information then is needed ( such as signatures, actual photos of the person, address etc)

Reached out to Airbnb support and they consistently refused to give me a clear answer. My tinfoil hat theory is that Airbnb knows this practice is not exactly kosher but does not want to lose the business these hosts are generating.

travel,Caution: AirBnb hosts can be contagious with flu/colds and no requirement to inform guests,"I just had a VERY expensive lesson in Washington DC.  A $330 weekend stay at a AirBnb share (one room in a 2 br condo) turned into a disaster.  I guess, stupid me, there is \*no\* requirement that hosts notify you that their home is an incubus of viral contagion.  I arrived Friday (10 January) and heard a few coughs from the hostess.  When I returned from dinner, and went to my room, the coughing became almost non-stop until she fell asleep at about midnight, yes I could hear it through the wall.  I can't express how annoying this was, especially since I ended up catching the virus and spent all day Sunday in bed (at a hotel).

&#x200B;

The hosts were completely, utterly unapologetic, saying it is ""cold and flu season"".  They could have cared less that they ruined my weekend vacation and forced me to incur another $300 in hotel costs.   So tough sh\*t, get lost was their attitude.  Airbnb did nothing except refund their service fee, $45.

&#x200B;

So, as stupid as this sound.... call your host before you arrive and ensure they are healthy because you want to enjoy your vacation or event.  You would think a sick ""host"" would have the decency to call a guest and give the guest the option to stay or not, but no.  That is not how it works.  So, if you are on an expensive vacation, I suggest you call ahead or avoid AirBnb shares altogether.

For Florence I already booked an airbnb that is right next the the Piazza Duomo, with a terrace right next to and overlooking the Cathedral dome!

Where would you reccomend to stay for Rome? Rome is much larger than Florence, so I'm not sure where I should look for airbnbs. I am staying 3 nights in Rome.

Same for the Amalfi Coast, I am struggling to decide. I was thinking of possibly taking the Ferry from Naples to Capri and staying one night there. And then maybe take a Ferry to one of the towns on the Amalfi Coast and stay there for the rest 3 nights. It would be neat to stay in one of the AC towns like Amalfi/Positano/Ravello.

As we boarded the train, we were told the train was cancelled due to a strike from the train workers. Our AirBNB host helped us get a bus to Salerno, and arrange a private driver. We actually booked the wrong bus stop (20 minutes out of Salerno) and with all this together, instead of arriving 4 hours before our hosts stops check in, we are now going to arrive over an hour after they stop checkin and normal communication. 

We feel eternally grateful as we are riding to Amalfi in the car, and I feel VERY bad we made the driver go 20 minutes further than needed and the host is staying to get us checked in. Is it ok to tip the AirBNB host when we meet?  If so how much?  We feel guilty and want to show our deepest appreciation for them waiting for the late Americans.

travel,How We Got Through My Dad's Coma in Rome,"Hello all, 

Just a little less than one month ago while on vacation in Rome, Italy, my dad suffered a kidney failure.  He was admitted into the intensive care unit at the Ospedale Isola Tiberina on 8/19/24.  I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1expku0/my_dad_is_in_the_icu_at_ospedale_isola_tiberina/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rome/comments/1exnoq3/my_dad_is_in_the_icu_at_ospedale_isola_tiberina/) on r/rome and r/travel

When the incident happened, I was at a loss because I had no idea how I could provide support to my mom while she was away in Rome and I was in Los Angeles.  My passport was not updated.  

I posted to Reddit in a panic mainly looking to how my mom could be supported during that time.  My mom would effectively be alone within 3 days, she did not speak Italian, she did not know how to get around except via Taxi which was around $20 a ride, her hotel, a Best Western was $170 a night, she needed her own meds.    
  
Long story short, my mom got through with it from my sister and I communicating with their travel insurance company, help with connections her sister had in Rome, my brother-in-law, and me being able to make a trip to Rome.  My dad was able to improve from being in a coma for about one week to walking through LAX on 9/12/24 (with assistance) 

As we were experiencing this situation, my mom, sister, and I would talk about different things from Reddit that she could try.    
  
This post is essentially about what worked and what might've been helpful to know at the time.  


* **Buying the insurance when buying their plane tickets for ITA airways was the single most important thing they did.**  We ended up emailing FALCK or whoever Generali Global Assistance. The company helped contact my dad's medical insurance, Kaiser, who helped fund his hospital stay and helped make arrangements.  This did take lots and lots of follow-up, emails, and coordination with my sister and me**.**    
* **Make sure to leave usernames and passwords somewhere people can access.**   My dad is better and once he woke up he tried using his phone but essentially locked himself out of his iPhone.  He can't remember his apple username, password.  As I type this out, I still need to help him figure this out.  However, my sister and I were able to help pay bills on their mortgage, electricity, gas, cable, etc, and put to rest any concerns my mom and dad had while being away.  At least my dad was organized enough with his bills that we could assist.  
* **My mother got the majority of help navigating Rome from one of her sister's connections in Rome.**  This individual was able to help my mother use the Roma Atac and pointed her towards neighborhoods from which they would be able to affordably commute to the hospital.  Previous to this, she would travel via taxi.  
* **Based on learning how to commute, My brother-in-law's internet savvy helped them locate a really good AirBnB that limited their housing and transportation costs.**  My brother-in-law bought an **e-SIM Card (Airalo)** which helped my mom do Messenger while at the hospital and generally anywhere in the city.  When my mom's friends left, she was faced with the prospect of finding a more affordable place to stay.  The stay at Best Western cost them $170-200 a night.  For 20 days, they were able to find an AirBnB at around a cost of $2400+.  Included were things that they were able to do to carry on as if they were living in the city --- washing clothes, light cooking, dishes.  It was an absolute steal.
* **The translation app and Google translate is what helped one of the Italian-speaking doctors communicate with us.**  Translation was one of the biggest hurdles in the management of my dad's case, as my parents speak English and Tagalog with a handful of fluent English speakers who would be there about 50% of the time.  My mom had the translate app on her iPhone but she wanted my brother-in-law and me to be there using those apps and communicating some things with the doctor and staff.  Only towards the end of our stay did she begin using the translate app on her phone.  Based on Reddit suggestions, my mom really looked hard for the ufficina di stranieri and the US consulate but did not find any ufficina at the Ospedale Isola Tiberina and the US Consulate simply said she could hire a translator.      
* **To get my own expired US passport updated, I got the best response and a lightning-quick response from emailing my local congressman. I** emailed my local congressperson under life-or-death emergency on a Friday, who set up an appointment for me the next-coming Monday.   I was able to get a passport by Weds.  The turn-around time to physically getting a Passport was 3 days!  If I would have known the turn-around time, I would have left earlier.  
* **The Lime Scooters and Bikes are kind of costly, but did make moving around the city a little easier for me.**  I was able to find cheaper and higher-quality food than the McDonalds that they became accustomed to during their stay.  Special shouts to that restaurant **Walk to Wok.**   
* **I took a leave of absence from my work doing my best to communicate the situation with them.**  At the time I requested a leave of absence my dad was still not awake, but there was hope that he was gaining consciousness and awareness of my mother's presence.  I committed to working at least a week and then gave myself about 3 weeks to get it sorted out. My employer requested not only a doctor's note, but had their own leave of absence form.  About 2 or 3 nights that I had gotten there, I spent a long night on my iPhone's Translator app trying to explain all the questions on the form they wanted the doctors to sign.  I even wrote a letter communicating that this letter was critical for my employer.  I was able to get the forms signed by these doctors in Italy!",412,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1fgixe8/how_we_got_through_my_dads_coma_in_rome/,2024-09-14 10:15:31,Airbnb

travel,PSA: Be wary of using Airbnb during Peak Travel times,"This is primarily about what airbnb's effective policies are when a host cancels on very short notice (but before the arrival date). This is after about 6 hours on the phone, and 3 supervisors, with airbnb looking for alternatives to work for us.

In all re-booking instances airbnb keeps your original payment.

* They will offer to re-book with an extra 10% of credit, on approval they can go higher, however when only remaining airbnb's with similar features are ~2x what you paid they will not re-book you into those.

* If they re-book you in an airbnb without the same features you originally had, if it is more expensive they wont refund you to compensate for loss of features. E.g. Its like paying for an IPhone X, and getting an IPhone 8.

* They will consider hotels, but when looking at hotels they will only pay for number of beds, so if you had a 3 bedroom for 6 people, they will pay for enough rooms for 3 beds, not 3 separate bedrooms.

* In no instance will they offer to provide a full or partial refund while putting you in less than ideal accommodation be it a hotel or other airbnb

* If none of those options work, they will refund your money and give you a non-transferable 10% credit to your airbnb account for a future stay.

In a normal situation these are mostly reasonable as alternatives would be available, though far more airbnb friendly than traveler friendly. During peak holiday season, e.g. xmas week, it is fairly disingenuous as the alternative options are usually sub-par or remaining hotel rooms are very expensive. So you booked a $4000 house with 3 bedrooms, a pool and a kitchen for a week;  you could end up spending $4000 for 3 hotel rooms at a random hotel for a week. 



My Anecdote, Our host cancelled 4 days prior to our Boxing Day arrival, we had a 4 bedroom place walking distance to the beach with a pool. We had paid $550 a night for 5 nights (about middle range for the area), the only things remaining with those features were between $1200-1800/night. They offered to put us in two hotel rooms, with a king bed and pullout sofa each, which wasn't acceptable.

at first I was staying in AirBnBs because I had family with me.. no problem, those that advertised AC, actually had working AC, meaning I could set the temp low, and watch it gradually drop.

Now i'm 7 countries deep into the trip, still have a while to go,  I've stayed at quite a lot of hotels.  None actually had real AC, they have a dummy panel and ""ventilation"".

I explicitly paid for AC, went out of my way and paid extra just for hotels with AC.. none of them actually work, even the 4 star hotels.
""oh it's controlled by a central unit"" .. not it isn't, it's not even blowing.

travel,Follow up on AirBnb: How to find an apartment with a kitchen without Airbnb,"The most recent AirBnb thread got too large and I think this deserves its own topic, since it is only tangentiality related to the other thread. In said thread the OP mentions"" I think having a kitchen makes for much better travel so I'm not quite prepared to pull the plug and just hotel.""

When I started travelling I also made the assumption that regular booking sites were for hotels and AirBnb for quaint guest houses. That is absolutely not the case!

There are plenty of guest houses on regular hotel booking sites. Often they are the same listings as on AirBnb, only cheaper. Especially if you have a discount status for frequent booking. For example I book a lot with Booking.com and get up to 20% for that. I see a lot of the AirBnb listings on Booking and most of they are already a tad cheaper on Booking before the discount applies. The old days were AirBnb was a great budget option are long gone. 

Secondly, depending on the location there can be apartment hotels available that have a guest house style apartment  with a fully equipped kitchen, appliances etc. But they also have a hotel complex. On the Canary islands we stayed in several such hotels. We had a kitchen, a public swimming pool, a pool table and bar, all for a reasonable price (50€ per night).

Lastly, consider Hostels. You'll have a shared kitchen, but usually a good one. Many hostels have a private room option.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11c5sxs/follow_up_on_airbnb_how_to_find_an_apartment_with/,2023-02-26 04:57:46,Airbnb

travel,Travel insurance - do I need to add all travelers if all I want is to protect my airbnb reservation?,"I'm scheduled to leave for a trip with my family (5 of us) in a few days, and the weather is looking bad - there looks like a good chance that the trip will be delayed (if not cancelled).

We have a nonrefundable airbnb, and that's the only thing I'm interested in protecting the cost of (i.e. don't care about medical insurance or anything like that for any of us).  Since I'm traveling with them, and staying in the airbnb with them, do they all have to be listed on the insurance?  The cost of the airbnb is the same, whether I'm the only one staying there or 10 people are staying.   

The price of the insurance is doubled if I include everyone (presumably because 4 extra people are covered for medical, lost luggage, etc.), so if the only thing I'm covering is the airbnb, I'd rather just pay for myself.

Would there be any issue if I only purchase the insurance for myself?",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/zqybxk/travel_insurance_do_i_need_to_add_all_travelers/,2022-12-20 20:12:05,Airbnb

travel,Halong Bay Half Day Tour with Duc An (Airbnb Experience),"I took a TripAdvisor contributor's tip and picked the cheapest tour for the Halong Bay Half Day Tour because everyone goes to the same places.

This was my experience. Punctual transport from my hotel to the pier.

Great communication via Airbnb although start times displayed on the site when booking are incorrect. I confirmed that if I took the 11:30am tour that I would be back in time for 5:30pm pick up for my private transfer to Hanoi. I was assured that I would not miss pick-up.

My group was escorted by a coordinator inside and instructed to sit down where we were abandoned for approximately 40 minutes. One couple left because we did not know who we were waiting for, if anyone would return, or where we were going.

The coordinator returns, hands out tickets and then led us to the boat. No explanation and she did not understand my inquiry about why we were left for so long with no instructions.

We get on the boat and had a family style lunch as we cruised along the bay. The food was included in the ticket price but beverages were additional.

Note: Every stop was teeming with people so if you want a more relaxing experience the early morning tour is probably your best bet.

We stopped to kayak (20-30 min). Very beautiful. At the end of the kayaking me and a German couple were asked for an additional 50k for the kayak. We both thought it was included but went ahead and paid the fee. No one else on the boat was asked to pay to kayak. Luckily, the tour guide double checked and learned we did not have to pay so at the next stop our 50k was refunded.

After lunch and kayaking the crew offered jewelry and other souvenirs for sale.

We were also escorted through a cave (45 min) where I made a wish on the stone turtle. Then we stopped on an island. I began to worry because the island departure was scheduled for 45 minutes later and it was already almost 4pm. With an hour ride back to the pier and another 15 minutes to my hotel I was going to miss pick-up.

I decided to skip the island and asked a departing boat if I could return to Halong Bay City with them. Not only did the captain and tour guide of the other boat allow me to hitch a ride but the tour guide made phone calls on my behalf. He called my hotel so I could give permission for the driver to pick up my baggage, saving precious time. He called the transport company to arrange an alternate pick-up location and to wait an additional 20 minutes for me to arrive. He had one of the bar ladies take me the the new pick up location on the back of her scooter.

The tour guide refused tip. I paid a small fee to the captain and the bar lady. The bar lady returned half of the fee and refused to accept anything more.

I made it to Hanoi with all my possessions and in awe that this company jumped through so many hoops to help me. I'm very grateful.",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11ecvre/halong_bay_half_day_tour_with_duc_an_airbnb/,2023-02-28 16:25:41,Airbnb

travel,Would you spend a month in Oslo? ,"My favorite way to travel is to rent an Airbnb for a month in the summer (which is the only time of year that my family can get away for that long). We do this partly because many Airbnbs offer a discount when you rent for a month, and partly because we just enjoy traveling this way. (It's like pretending to live somewhere else! We do still travel around a bit and take overnight trips, using the Airbnb as a home base.)   
  
We were thinking about going to Oslo this summer, but everyone seems so down on Oslo! I would love your thoughts if you have been there, or if you have any other recommendations. 

Our only criteria is that we prefer to be in a large-ish city, and we'd like it to be cold in July (like in the 60s Fahrenheit). We stayed in Edinburgh for a month, and it was perfect. We also loved Montreal (which was warmer, but we had air-conditioning). I would love to hear any suggestions of cities that you love that are cold! (Just please do not suggest splitting up the trip with 2 weeks here and 2 weeks there—I know spending a month in one place is too long for some people, but we love doing it this way.)

travel,"Airbnb will always charge you in your local currency, whatever currency you select from the drop-down menu","So, someone posted on here recently that if you select the local currency, then that is what you're billed in. I tried this for a booking in Oslo and selected NOK (Norwegian Krona). However, when the bill came through it was in GBP. 

I double-checked this with their online help who confirmed that you will always be billed in the local currency of the card.

So, why is this such a big deal? Well, in the conversion, they will charge you the inter-bank fee minus a 3% 
currency conversion fee. I have a card that doesn't charge this fee and gives me the straight Interbank FX rate.

So, basically, Airbnb has found a way to squeeze another 3% out of any cross-border reservations. 

What this means is that in my example, they have increased the fee they charge for a booking by 22%! Here's the maths:  
Total booking cost: £390-  
Airbnb fee: £49-  
Conversion at 3% = £11- (or so)

travel,I'm getting cold feet and I don't know if I should cancel our trip.,"Hello,

I live in a very arid, monotone and ugly part of Texas and all my life I've been craving mountains, forests and seasons. Because of money issues, I could never afford to travel when I was younger.

My husband is Dutch, and we lived in NL for 3-5 months before moving back to Texas. We've explored many parts of Europe together and a bit of Mexico and the Caribbean.

Well, we went camping for the first time to Big Bend (national park in Texas) and oh my god it was the best trip of our life. We didn't know we liked camping until we did it. The amazing views, the smell of campfire, the starry nights, camping food, the freezing nights and hot days, the howls of the coyotes and the epic hikes.

We saved up $45k usd. And guess where my hubby wanted to spend it? Yup. camping in North America (excluding Mexico because road trips are a bit dangerous right now). He already got A LOT of camping equipment.

He wants to do it until the money runs out (maybe a little less than a year?). Basically living super frugal, campsite hopping, etc. Spend the winters in cheap airbnbs or motels (or go home). He wants to see the beauty of America in every season, see the national parks, go hiking before he gets too old, ""live an adventure""

But I'm scared. I feel with this money we could have a really nice time in SE Asia or Latam, or even Europe. Don't get me wrong, I would love to do this trip, but I feel a lot could go wrong.

I feel we're doing a wrong decision, but I have nobody to talk to or that can give me advice.

Booked apartment in Melbourne via Wotif.com for the dates of 25/06/2021 to 5/07/2021 and paid 
$1180.00 in full.
25/06/2021 (Day 1 of 10 – arrival day)
Serviced Apartments Melbourne (Agent) contacted us via phone to request a security deposit of 
$300.00 to be paid immediately, and a copy of a Drivers licence be provided to them immediately. 
This occurred on the day of our arrival from Canberra to Melbourne. We questioned this process 
and advised we were happy to do so upon arrival as this was noted on our booking confirmation and 
is usually standard industry practice. We were advised this was conditional of receiving the code and 
key collection details for our apartment. We reluctantly complied as it was the day of 
accommodation and would have lost our full cost of $1180.00 for the apartment if we refused.
After flying in to Melbourne from Canberra, we collected the key from the nominated location of 
*Liquorologist (a bottleshop on Elizabeth Street not far from Empire Apartment Building on A’Becket 
Street). Upon entering room 1708 we were immediately struck with an odour which permeated 
from the apartment. Once we entered the apartment, we were struck with the realisation that it 
looked nothing like the advertised apartment. Upon closer inspection, we also noticed there was 1 
bathroom missing as we had paid for a 2bedroom apartment with 2 bathrooms to accommodate our 
family. We also noticed the apartment appeared to be in extreme disrepair. The kitchen had 
exposed wiring hanging down from the splashback, the soft furnishings were covered in stains and 
burn marks, the counter tops and table tops were in disrepair showing signs of severely peeling paint 
and burn marks. The carpet was filthy with black stains all over the once cream coloured floor 
covering. There appeared to be some kind of blood or body fluid splattered on one of the bedroom 
walls, and there were also small holes in one of the walls and other severe wear and tear I’ve never 
seen before. This was enough for us to attempt to contact the Agent to discuss the issues.
5.31pm we called the mobile number provided on our booking confirmation (0410 352 417) twice. 
However, we later discovered this was the cleaner and not the Agent.
5.33pm we attempted to call the Agent (03-9855 8868) twice. They didn’t answer the phone and a 
voicemail advising office hours were 9am to 7pm Monday to Saturday, and to call back during 
business hours. This was frustrating for us as we were calling during their nominated business 
hours, and we needed to rectify the situation. 
5.35pm we located the Agent website and called them on another phone number as listed there 
(1300-599 650) twice. This had the same message recording as the above number, which confirmed 
to us we were calling the right place. 
5.38pm we call Wotif.com (1800-047 553), but after being on hold for more than 1 hour, we were at 
that point attend our pre-organised AFL game at the MCG for our first ever live AFL game, and we 
were disconnected in the elevator on the way out. On our way out of Empire Apartment Building, we mention our situation to the Concierge in the 
Lobby. The Concierge there acknowledged our situation, and advised it was quite common for that 
to happen to customers of Serviced Apartments Melbourne. He went on to say that some 
customers arrive and are unable to collect a key to gain entry as it never existed. He was confident 
that in 98% of cases it wasn’t a good outcome or experience.
We continued to call the agent and cleaner on all of their phone numbers without success; twice at 
5.55pm, and three times at 6.08pm. At this point we were feeling quite helpless and called 
Wotif.com again.
6.37pm we got through to a customer service officer at Wotif.com and after a conversation lasting 
over 45minutes where we explained the situation of the room, they offered a $50 wotif voucher and 
an apology as they were also unable to successfully contact the property Agent. It was quite 
frustrating for us as they didn’t understand how bad the situation was, and we felt like they were 
quite dismissive of our concerns and rights as their customer.
8.55pm we received a phone call from the Agent (Dan) in response to the Wotif.com request to 
contact us regarding the accommodation issues. Dan advised we had been given the correct 
apartment and after we insisted, he check the booking. Dan acknowledged that he could see we had 
indeed booked a 2bedroom 2bathroom apartment, and had been provided with a 2bedroom 
1bathroom apartment. Upon this realisation, he said he had a 2bedroom 2bathroom apartment 
available in Southbank which was 2km away from the Empire Building which was our original 
booking. We mentioned that if it was is as bad condition as the current apartment we were 
allocated not to bother, as we weren’t about to move across town to another dump of an 
apartment. The location being 2km away from the city was disappointing as we wanted the city 
immersive experience for our family. However, staying in that apartment was not an option for us.
We accepted his offer believing the new apartment would be more like what they had advertised on 
Wotif.com. In order for us to collect the keys from the bottleshop by 11pm closing, we had no other 
option but to leave the MCG prior to the end of the game, effectively cutting short our family
experience at the MCG.
We jumped in an Uber due to time constraints and were driven across town to the Empire 
Apartment to collect our bags and exchange the keys to Empire apt 1708 for the Australia 108 apt 
2118 from the bottleshop on Elizabeth Street.
10.17pm we jumped into another Uber with our family and all of our luggage and headed over to 
Australia 108 apartment 2.2km away. Upon arrival we made our way to apartment 2113. The fob 
on the keyring provided access to the elevator to level 21 where the apartment was located. We 
attempted to open the door with the key as provided, and the key wouldn’t fit in the key lock. It was 
clearly the wrong key, and there were no other keys on the keyring to try.
At this stage we are calling the Agent and anyone we can find listed on their website to gain access 
to this or any other apartment. Between 10.54pm and 11.06pm we tried to call various numbers 11 
times without success and waiting on hold to Wotif for 47 minutes before being disconnected.
At this point we went to the Lobby of the Australia 108 apartment complex and raised the challenge 
with the building concierge attendants to request their assistance in gaining access to the apartment. They refused. Their refusal was devastating to us. We offered to show them our 
booking confirmation along with photo ID to prove we were legitimate, however they refused. 
We decided to relocate from outside the apartment door as it was becoming very cold and we were 
mindful our presence in the corridor might be disturbing other residents at this time. We also 
needed to use the bathroom facilities.
Our family relocated to the Lobby with our luggage and again tried to explain the situation to the 
concierge our situation and appeal to their sympathetic side. They would not listen to us and 
advised that despite having a master key to all apartments, they would not provide us with access, 
but offered to call their locksmith at our expense.
We declined their offer at this point as we felt it was unreasonable for us to be out of pocket when 
they could simply turn a key and give us access. At this point they advise will not permit us to wait in 
their lobby, and we were to wait on the street. We refused to wait on the street as it was past 
midnight by this time, and we were now in desperate need of use of bathroom facilities which they 
had been denying us access to.
The Australia 108 apartment building is a very busy place, with visitors and residents coming and 
going frequently 24 hours a day. I was forced to suffer the humiliation of bathroom refusal and was 
very close to wetting my pants in a very public area with no where to clean myself up. I was forced 
to raise my voice and be further humiliated and demand the use of bathroom facilities before I made 
a mess on their floor. I have never been so publicly humiliated in my life. They reluctantly took 
myself and my son (one at a time) to the 11th floor PUBLIC TOILET. We later discovered we should 
have had access to this floor as it housed the amenities like pool, spa and gym. But our fob did not 
provide the required access.
It was during this bathroom visit that one of the concierge confided in me that he wanted to assist 
me but he was scared of losing his job.
We reluctantly accepted them to call their locksmith (Universal Locksmiths) after the two local 
locksmiths delayed their arrival several times and increasing the price as the morning grew nearer. 
Shortly before 1am the building locksmith arrived within about 15minutes of receiving the call, 
which at the time we assumed was due to him being on contract to the building.
We very quickly realised the locksmith was potentially a frequent visitor to this apartment as he 
quickly flipped off the coverplate on the apartment door lock, and already had the correct unique bit 
in his drill ready to go, unscrewed two screws revealing a switch which he quickly flicked with his 
finger and opened the door. It was quite obvious to us that disarming the door lock should have 
been more involved than that (husband is a carpenter by trade), and we found his offer to change 
the barrel at an additional $250 insulting when his fee was $310 already. Subsequently we 
contacted this locksmith after our return home to Canberra and we explained our situation and our 
suspicions, and he refunded $60 of his fee on 12/07/2021 off his own bat.
Having gained entry we were advised by the locksmith to be mindful not to exit the apartment with 
the door locked as we wouldn’t be able to gain entry with the wrong key which was issued to us. 
Despite assuring us we would be issued with a payment receipt at the time of payment, he reneged 
on this after we completed a bank transfer to their business account. He assured us one would be sent when his office opened in the morning, which he later honoured. Nevertheless, we were left 
feeling frustrated and upset at this ongoing situation.
Once the locksmith had left, we were left to finally inspect apartment 2113 at Australia 108. We 
were speechless. The apartment appeared to be in better condition. We soon discovered the 
following deficiencies in the apartment:
• Heating system broken (no heating or cooling)
• TV not functioning
• No power cable for wifi (or passwords)
• Large exhaust fan constantly on (only way to disable this was at the fuse box)
• Soft furnishings covered in stains etc, similar to previous apartment
• Burn marks on the table and surface tops, carpets filthy
• Springs poking out from one of the beds
• Double sized beds (not QS beds as per advertisement)
• Limited kitchen crockery (2 mugs, 1 glass, odd and chipped plates, no teaspoons, bent and 
dirty cutlery)
Despite being different to the original Empire building, this apartment (2113) was significantly 
different from the pictures Serviced Apartments Melbourne display on their website advertising 
their apartment offerings for holiday rentals.
Our first night sleep was by no means restful. It was very very cold and we were forced to sleep in 
our clothes as there were no additional blankets in the apartment. It was after 3am by the time we 
got everyone sorted into a bed. We slept for a couple of hours, but it definitely wasn’t restful sleep 
by any means.
26/06/2021 (Day 2 of 10)
8.45am Jon (my Husband) went to Southbank Police Station after finding the address of Serviced 
Apartments Melbourne head office online, and it appeared that things weren’t adding up and we 
believed we were being scammed and felt unsafe and was seeking their advice on our next course of 
action. The Police advised that it was more of a civil matter, and they were not in a position to assist 
us in any way. While we understood their reasoning, we felt completely abandoned in a foreign 
place over 600kms away from our home town of Murrumbateman NSW.
9.02am Dan calls (Agent). Jon filled Dan in on the ongoing situation. Dan questioned why we didn’t 
use their locksmith, and we said we would have if anyone had bothered to answer their phones last 
night. Dan also asked why we didn’t change the barrel at the same time, and of course we didn’t 
want to be out of pocket a further $250 at the start of our family holiday after already being down 
over $300 after the first night. Upon further discussion to resolve the key, Dan advised his locksmith 
doesn’t work weekends anyway and we would need to wait until Monday for the key situation to be 
rectified. Dan also assured us he would reimburse us immediately for the $310 incurred by the 
locksmith once we provided him with the tax invoice, which we did later that day via email. We 
point out that we are unable to leave the apartment as we can’t lock the door until Monday, 
effectively voiding the first four days of our holiday. Dan suggested we could leave the door 
unlocked while the apartment was unattended, but this suggestion was unacceptable and unsafe with a high risk of being robbed. Jon mentioned to Dan that it felt like we were in the middle of a 
scam, and he had attended the local Police Station to seek advice. Dan appeared to be quite 
agitated by this development.
9.54am – Dan calls (Agent) advising he had another apartment in the same building, however it only 
had one bathroom. As compensation, he said we could keep possession of apartment 2113 for the 
purpose of the use of the second bathroom for term of our stay. He also suggested we take the 
bedding from apartment 2113 with us to 5306 (new apartment) for our use. We now know this is 
due to the fact the next apartment also lacked any form of heating.
10.03am – Dan emailed apartment details through for the new apartment and we had to go back to 
the bottleshop to collect the keys at 1pm when it opened which was another two Uber rides.
1.40pm – Purchased 2 heaters from Big W Queen Victoria Village total cost $78.00. This was for the 
use of the bathroom in 2113. As we discovered soon after gaining entry to the 3rd apartment (5306) 
on our holiday, it also lacked any kind of heating services in the apartment (also broken). We raised 
this with Dan, and he advised he wasn’t able to get it fixed and would provide us with heaters, but 
we had already purchased them just in case. 
Other deficiencies in this apartment included:
• Heating system broken (no heating or cooling)
• TV not functioning
• No Wifi access (advertised)
• No Netflix (advertised)
• No washing machine (advertised)
• Large exhaust fan constantly on (only way to disable this was at the fuse box)
• Soft furnishings covered in stains etc, similar to previous apartment
• Limited kitchen utensils
• Dirty used face masks in utensils drawer
• Garbage stored in the bottom of the kitchen pantry cupboard
• Limited hot water available
• No access to amenities (gym, pool etc)
• No housekeeping (weekly housekeeping advertised)
27/06/2021 (Day 3 of 10 - My birthday)
We attempt to put a load of washing on in apt 5306 before heading out for a day of birthday 
activities, except we realise there is only a dryer and the washing machine is missing. Just another 
thing to add to the list of issues.
Trying to start to cheer ourselves up on this so far terrible holiday, we don’t let it get to us because 
we still have use of the other apartment (2113) and even though its two elevator rides away we can 
manage it to get the washing done. We decide to go out and try have a good day and we plan to do 
the washing later in the day, which we achieved.Being hopeful that my birthday holiday could be a positive experience from here on in….
Jon purchased a connection to try to connect the TV to the antennae. It became clear that the wall 
connection was not connected to an external antenna rendering the TV useless as it couldn’t tune in 
any channels. Without use of wifi which we had repeatedly requested the password for, we couldn’t 
even get Netflix which was also advertised as being available in the apartment.
28/06/2021 (Day 4 of 10)
10.28am – Dan calls (Agent). Dan states he is withdrawing the offer to allow us to keep both 
apartments, and we were to immediately surrender the keys for apartment 2113 to the bottleshop 
on Elizabeth Street in the CBD. We did not see this as a reasonable or acceptable solution as we 
would no longer have access to a washing machine or a second bathroom. We also refused to 
attend the bottleshop once again as it would be an additional cost to us and we had been suffering 
physically now from the additional walking into the city. We offered instead to drop the key in the 
mailbox of the apartment in the lobby which is a secure mailbox. We also offered to leave the key in 
the apartment 2113 in line with the checkout procedure. Dan advised this was not possible as there 
would be other occupants of that apartment from 2pm that day. We raised the issue again about 
the washing machine and the TV not working, and he assured us he would have that situation 
rectified immediately. We confirmed once this had been done, we were happy to return the key 
(that still didn’t fit the apartment door lock). At this point we were accused of blackmailing them 
and threatened to charge us for both rooms. We explained that all we wanted was holiday 
accommodation as they had advertised on their listing on Wotif. Dan became irate towards Jon. 
Dan also threatened we would forfeit our security deposit if we didn’t return the key. We had no 
choice but to immediately comply as demanded by Dan and started to make our way back to the 
bottleshop.
10.45am – Dan calls (Agent). Suggested leaving the key in apartment 2113 itself. Dan also advises 
that he has a fourth apartment for us to move to and would send through the confirmation and key 
collection details via email shortly. 
12.28pm – Apartment 3717 confirmation and details received via email.
1.05pm – Dan calls (Agent), advising apartment 3717 was withdrawn just as I had arrived to the 
bottleshop to collect the keys. 
1.09pm – Jon calls the bottleshop to enquire if the key was ready for collection out of curiosity. 
These guys (Dan and co-hort) seemed to be operating a bit hap-hazzardly, and our fingers were 
crossed that the fourth apartment might be more in line with the advertised apartment. If we were 
able to gain entry to an acceptable apartment, we would have happily returned all other keys and 
moved on. This is not something we are proud of attempting to do, and quite out of character for 
us, but goes to demonstrate our desperation to try and make our situation better on this so far 
nightmare holiday. Bottleshop guy initially confirmed they key was ready for collection. However, 
voices in the background can be clearly heard giving instructions to advise the key wasn’t there. Jon 
immediately called me to abort our attempt at key collection at 1.12pm. I complied. We feel the offering of another apartment was like dangling a carrot for us to placate us as by this 
stage we were quite upset and frustrated. We believe they had no intention of making good on 
their offer for a suitable apartment for us to use for the rest of our stay.
3.40pm – Jon called Mani (the cleaner) as we still had no washing. Mani advised she would contact 
Dan and provide further advise after that. Jon asked Mani if we could use the washing machine in 
2113, and she asked us not to as she had just completed a clean. Jon promised to be respectful and 
not touch anything except the washing machine and Mani agreed to this. 
Jon attended apartment 2113 and upon entry it was immediately evident that someone had been 
there and emptied the apartment of all of the furniture. The only remaining items were the beds 
sans linen, and a couple of pictures which had been removed from the wall. Jon found this to be 
quite alarming as Mani had just told him she had completed a clean of apartment 2113, and Dan had 
advised occupants would be arriving at 2pm that same day. 
Jon immediately called Dan alarmed that the apartment had been robbed, and Dan said he was 
already aware that the apartment was being emptied despite saying something to the contrary 
earlier in the day and accused us of not leaving the key. Jon advised he was no longer confident 
leaving the key in the apartment was a safe option and he didn’t want to take the risk of it going 
missing costing us our bond. Jon offered to take the key to the bottleshop, to which Dan advised Jon 
to deposit the key in the mailbox of 2113 which was our earlier suggestion that he had previously 
not agreed to. 
Jon filmed the empty apartment on his phone.
I deposited the key as requested and took photo evidence of me doing so.
29/06/2021 (Day 5 or 10)
11.21am – Dan calls (Agent) advising Mani (the cleaner) will attend to rectify all of the mentioned 
issues.
Approx 11.45am – Mani arrives with a washing machine and asks Jon to assist with shifting the dryer 
out to place it on top of the washing machine. Jon is happy to as Mani is quite a slight lady. At that 
time Jon was messaging the A Current Affair website desperate for someone to be sympathetic to 
our situation. Jon informs Mani of this and asks her to go ahead and fix the TV situation first to allow 
him to deal with A Current Affair. Shortly thereafter, Mani suddenly realises she has the incorrect 
cord for the TV, and leaves returning shortly after with a man we later know to be Michael Atwell. 
Jon questioned this man as to who he was and why he was present in the apartment. His demeaner 
was quite dismissive which was an indication to us that he was quite familiar with our situation. He 
ignored our questions and advised he was there to help with the washing machine. Jon questioned 
further where he had come from realising, he was likely to be more involved in the situation that he 
claimed to be. The man attached the TV cable but neglected to turn the TV on and check it was 
working. On realising his complacency, we figured he knew it wouldn’t fix the problem and asked 
him to check it before he left. He stated rather rudely and in a raised voice that “I don’t have time 
for this” and he left.
We were able to get a good look at Michael Atwell as he had neglected to wear a face mask inside 
the apartment. This made it very easy for us to identify him featuring in his website info-videos.
After some internet research, we have confirmed his identity as Michael Atwell. We know this to be 
correct as he owns a business called “For Sale For Lease”, which is the voice message on the 
answering service for the Serviced Apartments Melbourne. The For Sale For Lease website has a 
nice collection of videos featuring Mr Atwell promoting his business offerings. 
2.15pm – Dan calls (Agent), advising he was going to provide a full refund and we were free to find 
another apartment ourselves. Jon replied that we would accept that, conditional of the funds hitting 
our bank account whereupon we would immediately vacate the apartment. 
2.21pm – Dan called advising that the offer of a full refund wasn’t real. I feel like we had called his 
bluff and he wanted us out of the apartment with all of our money still in his pocket.
At some point during our stay in apartment 5306, we could hear an announcement being made in 
the building, but not on our speakers in the apartment. We opened the front door to the 
announcement “you can now return to the building”. Evidently, there had been a building 
evacuation and the alarms and announcements can not be heard inside apartment 5306 where we 
were occupying (no internal noise either as the TV is broken!). It should also be noted that there is 
other fire code violations throughout with no fire extinguisher or blanket available, and no 
evacuation map displayed as is required of a short-term stay apartment.
Throughout this ordeal we had already explored staying elsewhere right from day 2 of our holiday. 
The cost of moving to another apartment was prohibitive at such short notice, and we had 
exhausted a large chunk of our holiday money already with the unexpected additional expenses of a 
substantial deposit, locksmith, dozens of Ubers due to the unplanned location further from the city 
(mobility issues prevent a lot of walking). 
It just seemed to be one thing after another. Without the weekly housekeeping we were washing 
our own linen which revealed grubby quilts being used (complete with blood stains and other 
horrific unidentified stains). While removing the bed linen we revealed disguarded/opened condom 
wrappers, and a lack of cleaning in the bedroom areas. There was no broom in the apartment 
meaning we were unable to sweep the floor, and there was no dishwashing liquid or dish cloth. We 
bought our own so we were able to wash up both coffee cups and glasses so they could be 
immediately re-used by our family. The kitchen had a “junk” draw with an assortment of used face 
masks, broken electrical appliances, dirty tissues and other assorted grubby and broken implements. 
It is likely the couch has never been cleaned as there were handfuls of crumbs in between the seat 
cushions. 
We used a bed sheet from the other apartment to cover the filthy couch and chair so we could sit on 
it without stressing about the grubby mystery stains on it. There appeared to be a large food 
dehydrator in the pantry, and a printer/photocopy machine in the bedroom closet, Im unsure how 
useful either of those would be to anyone.
We have video evidence of apartment 2113 showing the state the apartment including vision of the 
screw falling out of the front door lock unassisted which is evidence of the lock being manipulated 
many more times than usual. It also shows evidence of a large build-up of dust on the exhaust fan which sucks air out of the apartment at a surprisingly high rate, except this type of outlet is 
supposed to be pushing air back into the apartment. It also shows the filthy stains and burn marks 
on the carpets and all surfaces throughout apartment 2113. It also shows a shopping bag full of dirty 
linen which is likely to have been left behind by a previous occupant who was forced to purchase 
their own clean linen. The video clearly shows the apartment is not professionally cleaned as they 
advertise on all of the websites. We are unsure if we are able to attach the video we have recorded 
to our claim, but we are more than happy to provide it immediately upon request.
5/07/2021 – (Day 10 of 10 – the last day)
From day 6 to our last day we continue to try to remain positive and make good of a nightmare 
holiday. To try to achieve this, we refrain from contacting Dan or the Agent until our scheduled 
check-out date of July 5. We attempt to call them several times on this day to ask when we can 
expect our security deposit and locksmith expense to be returned to our bank account as they had 
agreed to. They appeared to be no longer answering their phones or are possibly screening calls at 
this stage. On the fourth attempt, Dan’s assistant answers and advises Dan is busy and will call back 
shortly. Since then, on more than a dozen times, every time we call this is the same advice we 
receive. We were also asking for Michael Atwell, and were advised he was at lunch…..every time we 
called. The assistant answering phone calls (Im afraid each time I asked his name I couldn’t 
understand it), confirmed Michael Atwell to be a Director of that company.
Upon returning to Canberra on July 5, Jon was scheduled to return to work on July 6. However, he 
was compelled to take personal leave due to his level of anxiety about this whole situation. 
Subsequently, due to Jon being a frontline worker (Corrections Officer), he was advised to not attend 
his place of work for 14 days due to returning from Victoria, despite never being in a red-zone. Jon 
has used this time to recover and recuperate from this disastrous “holiday”, and it has afforded him 
time to work through claiming some of the expense back and hope for a make-up holiday at another 
time.
Jon has also sustained new injuries to both of his feet due to the literal running around on the first 
three nights trying to seek resolutions prior to closing times. These injuries are now ongoing for 
which he has sought medical treatment which will continue indefinitely until the chronic pain is 
healed.
I was due to return to work on July 7, but was forced to take a further three days off work on 
personal leave due to my mental health severely suffering due directly to this experience. I am also 
a public officer playing an integral role with maintaining the Canberra public transport network. A 
high pressure job deserving of some downtime with my family. But it just didn’t happen, and the 
impact in particular on my health and wellbeing is subject to ongoing repair.
This experience has put pressure on our family as a unit, on our marriage, and on our ability to 
perform effectively at work. The loss we have experienced from this situation is tremendous and 
ongoing. We claim the full amount up to the first threshold of $2999 in an attempt to assist with our 
healing as a family, and hopefully have an actual family holiday we can enjoy. 
*Liquorologist – a bottle shop on Elizabeth Street where one of the employees is charged to issue 
keys to customers of Serviced Apartments Melbourne (Agent) upon providing the correct key code. 
The relationship between the Liquorologist and the Agent is unknown. However, he did mention to 
us that he sees this happen all the time and almost every visitor collecting keys experiences the 
same situation we do. I believe this set-up is designed to remove the customer from any physical 
interaction with the Agent to avoid confrontation.
Through further investigations before we knew of the VCAT process to seek reimbursement, we 
undertook some detective work. What we uncovered through our internet research is the Michael 
Atwell operates under many different business names appearing to be a bit a jack-of-all trades. Our 
research also uncovered dozens of complaints dating back as far as 2017, where former customers 
tell their holiday disaster stories. It’s a shame the Agent business name isn’t provided by Wotif.com 
on their accommodation listing to allow consumers to do their own research. We incorrect through 
by going through a reputable booking agent like Wotif.com like we had many times before without 
issues, they would advocate for us if there was any kind of clear deception or misconduct taking 
place.
Michael Atwell seems to have his fingers in many pies and depending on which website you recover 
from an internet search, he provides different ABN/ACNs, names and bank account details with each 
one appearing to have its own trust account attached to it. You discover different addresses 
depending on where you look also. We believe Michael Atwell’s residential address to be 3 Vickers 
Street Hawthorne VIC (our source is related to Mr Atwell, but we will maintain their privacy for their 
own personal safety), and the ASIC website has the address listed as number 4 of the same street 
location. We believe this is to create a cloud of confusion as is common with their pattern of 
behaviour as we experienced while attempting to seek a satisfactory resolution from the Agent.
Our investigations also reveal that the level of customer service assured on all of their websites and 
voice mail messages is inconsistent and fabricated. They appear to be running a 24-hour business on 
casual hours and staff seem to be trained in providing a diversion to the customer just to get rid of 
them.

Expedia,Anyone else ripped off by expedia lately?,"Background: Due to COVID, my friend and I have waited over 13 months to meet again.  So, 2 weeks ago, I bought a ticket for my friend to travel from Saudi Arabia to LAX.  It was bought just a few days before travel, but neither of us noticed that the connection was through Amsterdam.  Well, when my friend tried to use the ticket, he was turned away at the counter, since he couldn't be flown to LAX due to COVID restrictions (travelling from Europe to the USA due to delta variant).  So, we booked another flight 2 days later, this time directly from Riyadh to LAX.  Unbelievably, my friend was not allowed to fly when boarding, due to an email from homeland security sent between checking in and boarding.  (I have more to complain about this part of things, but this is not about expedia).  

The point being, I immediately contacted expedia about both instances the same day, although I was hung up on/calls dropped while being on indefinite hold many many times.  

After finally getting through via phone a few times, each time the call dropped while being kept on hold.  The final time, they told me that the traveler never checked in, which is false, and that I will also be charged a ""No Show"" fee accordingly.  I talked with Delta/KLM immediately after, who said that they do indeed have a record of my traveler attempting to check in, and that they have no such thing as a ""No Show"" fee.  

After a total of wasting 2 days trying to contact their customer service over and over, begging them to call me back if the call was dropped, and no agent ever did.  Now when I call and enter my booking #, expedia's system tells me that what I enter isn't valid and hangs up.  There is literally no way for me to get this company on the phone, not that I expect much from this outfit at this point.  They told me that even though my friend tried to check in both times, his flight was cancelled, is not transferrable, and will not be refunded.

(BTW, I tried to make this as succinct as possible.  There is more to this story, but I just wanted to get the broad story first. )",13,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/oxgoua/anyone_else_ripped_off_by_expedia_lately/,2021-08-04 00:19:58,Expedia
Expedia,DO NOT EVER BOOK A PLANE WITH EXPEDIA. Expedia deserves a lesson. They will never resolve your problems,"I have told this story so many times......**to Expedia customer service agents (no exaggeration, like 20 of them)** that it feels tedious to say it once more. To summarize, I made a reservation through Expedia to visit my family. The day before the departure I tried the online check in to realize that our outbound flights were not found but our returning flights were still booked. I went to the airport and Air Canada confirmed that I had a reservation but explained to me that for some reason Expedia cancelled just my outbound flights. It was still awkward that just the returning flight was still there.

Here is where our nightmare started:

* 9 hours over the phone with multiple agents saying the same story over and over. Every time an agent says they'll leave a record on the system, don't trust them, the next person will tell you the same speech, ""I will help you, we will solve this, stay on the line, let me confirm your information to call you back, etc...."", bull\*\*\*t, they never do, they never care. One their agents, named Jake was even making jokes about our situation and saying everything was ok, except for one not so small detail: he was like the 7th agent we were dealing with, because that is what it is, you deal with them, not the other way around.
* Availability was basically inexistent for our travel plans, it is christmas, after pandemic, our families were going to meet our baby for the first time, my wife's dad had a surgery. These people never cares. After 3 hours with the same agent, I guess out of his own desperation, he said his supervisor has allowed him to ask us to book new planes, on whatever class, at whatever cost and that Expedia guarantees to us a full refund for those new airplane tickets since it was a problem on their end. We then, asked him to send a written proof about this. And we did get an email stating the above:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l03xuj8yg5681.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=3609856c1ca4a2dc13464f5e0ce24624311ab708

And a day or two later this one:

When we got this email we thought Expedia was a serious company........good luck with that, we went ahead naively and purchased the new tickets their own people advised us and thought, ok, we will submit all the receipts back, etc.....and here is where things got worse. I think they designed the customer service in a way that you give up because every time, let me repeat, every time the agents will make you tell the story again, promise to help, etc...all that bull\*\*\*t but you NEVER, EVER get anywhere. These new tickets costed a lot, A LOT, because obviously we had to get a higher class, with almost zero availability and 3 days later, which also meant all the emotional cost for us, all the stress, our families helping us to collect the money for the tickets, but obviously they don't care.

Things got worse, they are asking me to call back, to change my flights, which I never requested and guess what, as expected, to nobody's surprise, zero news about refunding anything and holding their promises above, so irresponsible for a company to ask their employees to make customers buy tickets when actually, they should have been the ones buying them and takin care of this.  


In conclusion I am done being over the phone so many hours, on the chats so many hours for nobody to just do what they promised, refund our tickets as they stated it themselves.",14,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/rio97e/do_not_ever_book_a_plane_with_expedia_expedia/,2021-12-17 18:58:11,Expedia

Expedia,Their customer service is so full of lies...NEVER USE EXPEDIA!,"Long story short I never got a refund that was allegedly processed, filed BBB complaint, their response was basically that it was somehow my bank's fault. Nobody replied to my further emails to customer service so I gave up on the refund. 

Then, yesterday I chat to an agent asking to close my Expedia account because I will never use Expedia again, I gave him the reason why without specific details. Then, I coincidentally receive an email later that night saying thank you for requesting to talk to a supervisor about my itinerary for the flight that I was owed a refund for (I didn't request that, the agent told me he would put in a request to close my account) and that a supervisor tried to call me and I didn't answer. I had my phone in my pocket all day and received not one missed call from anyone. 

So, I sent an angry email back calling them liars etc. and they send another email back today along the lines of sorry for your bad experience we hope you will give us another chance with absolutely no solution or any real kind of response to anything I have been saying to them. Seems like they won't even let me close my account, either?

Expedia is a lying, cheating, scamming, piece of shit company and I hope we can make them go bankrupt. NOBODY EVER USE EXPEDIA FOR ANYTHING!!!!!!!",33,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/rvwgep/their_customer_service_is_so_full_of_liesnever/,2022-01-04 15:06:18,Expedia

can anyone help? they sell tickets without cancellation and the verbiage is ""cancellation not allowed"". clearly they messed up this listing with their algorithm or what not and now are not honoring a refund which i'm clearly due. 

support tried to say no refund. when i pressed the issue and sent pics, now its being escalated and i have to wait 10 business days to find out if i'm screwed. they have a no cancel fee search filter for goodness sake.

Expedia,Expedia says I have no flight credits even when its showing in my account.,"I booked a 2 passenger roundtrip through Expedia back in March 2020 and have a ""credit"" to use until 3/31/22. The weird part is that we can see both credits on our account, but Expedia can only see one of them. 

 They spoke to American Airlines on our behalf and they are claiming they refunded my wife's credit to her credit card, but the other credit was available to use. And then they changed their story saying they issued a refund for both tickets. But our credits are still on account?

This makes no sense. We bought the flight tickets at the same time. Why would they fully refund one credit, but only credit the other? And then change their story?

Since the credit is also on our account (but these idiots can't see it), it allows us to book a trip, but it only shows 1 flight for our date. When we look at available flights that day by starting a new trip, all the other AA flights show up that day. So stupid. 

We are currently looking into her statements to see if refund was issued but so far nothing. Has this happened to anyone else?",3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/s6aef9/expedia_says_i_have_no_flight_credits_even_when/,2022-01-17 18:05:33,Expedia

Expedia,Good riddance Expedia!!," I've booked through Expedia many times over the years and had decent service. But then again, I don't ever remember having to access their customer service. Clearly I got lucky. I'm absolutely flabbergasted at their current stance. Like many Covid travels, mine was disrupted. I was issued a credit coupon for a cancelled hotel stay. I'm now looking to rebook but they have no availability at that hotel. After several calls (and ridiculously long waits on hold), I'm told my request will be escalated and will be emailed or called back in 72 hours. Nada! Call again. Finally get through and explain the situation all over again. The hotel has a sister hotel in the same city that does have avail. via Expedia. I'm told by cust service they'll escalated the ticket again but to call the hotel directly and book/use the credit. The hotel responds and suggests that Expedia allow the use of the credit at their sister hotel (other hotel is actually closed!). The money is with Expedia and not the hotel and therefore they can't apply the credit. Call Expedia yet again and they flat out refuse to apply the credit to the sister hotel in the same city, despite having it in writing from the hotel that this would be acceptable. I can only use the credit at the specific hotel that is currently closed. Clearly Expedia is so hard up that they need my money more than I do. They'll kick a long time customer to the curb for $700! Good riddance Expedia!!

The system asked me to push 1 again, but nothing happened again, the system asked me a 3rd time to push one, and after smashing the one button over and over again, the system just hung up on me.

Expedia,Expedia is run by monkeys [LONG] [RANT],"As with so many other travelers, our vacation got canceled last year due to Covid. We had to cancel two days before we were to leave. After many phone calls and time spent talking on the phone over a few weeks, Expedia finally and grudgingly issued us credit for our flights. Late last year we received an email saying that travel using this credit must be completed by Dec. 31, 2021.

&#x200B;

I'm from Canada and Canada has been in travel lockdown for most of Covid. We currently are not allowed to travel, and there is no projected open date for traveling. I suspect that once the vaccination schedule is complete, Canada may open up travel. As of now, the schedule is due to finish September of 2021. This means that the earliest we could potentially travel is most likely September. So that gives us about 4 months to plan a trip that we probably don't really want to take, while competing for the limited flights with everyone else, before the credits expire. Not fun.

&#x200B;

My extended family is desperate for all of us to take a trip. My niece found a cheap cruise leaving out of Orlando for January of 2022. She booked it for her family, with nearly everyone else following suit. We decided to see if we could book flights to Orlando using our Expedia credit for the potential cruise (still a bit nervous if travel will be possible or enjoyable by then).

&#x200B;

We phoned Expedia and were on hold for a little over 3 hours before the line went dead and we were cut off. Frustrating. We called the next day, early in the morning. After waiting for 3 and a half hours, we finally got to speak with someone. We first asked if the credit could be used in January of 2022. The woman said it could. We asked her to double check. She put us on hold and came back after 10 minutes and said that she confirmed that as long as it was booked prior to Dec. 31, 2021, it was fine. We proceeded to tell her when and where we wanted to go. During our entire (lengthy) conversation, she kept cutting out repeatedly. We think her headset was wonky. We were always scared we'd be cut off and have to start over.

&#x200B;

The woman kept repeatedly making small errors in our requests. She'd be off by a day, look up Fort Lauderdale instead of Orlando, get the departure/arriving cities mixed up, constantly giving us slightly differing times for flights.... it was a struggle. Add to that, after every request or question, she'd put us on hold for 5 to 10 minutes to ""check on something"" or ""wait for the computer to process.""

&#x200B;

After going through multiple flights (most of which would suddenly no longer be available just as we wanted to book), we were finally able to book. The process up to this point took a little over 3 hours with all of her interruptions, errors, cutting out, ""canceled"" flights, etc. (Keep in mind we've been on the phone now for nearly 7 hours by now).

&#x200B;

We settle on a flight that arrives at 7:30pm, after a connection in Dallas. We, of course, must pay the difference of the flights (about $200 total), despite the fact that I can find multiple flights online with better times and prices online. We HAVE to book though Expedia on the phone to redeem our credits.

&#x200B;

The woman emails us our itinerary and we immediately check it. It's wrong. Instead of arriving at 7:30pm, we're arriving at midnight. She never mentioned anything close to that. She insists she did, but my wife and I were both on the phone talking to her and we tell her she said 7:30pm. The connection in Dallas arrives at 7:30pm. Apparently that's all she was looking at. She says that it's booked now, the money is paid and there is nothing further she can do.

&#x200B;

We tell her that we're not happy and would like to speak to her supervisor. The line goes dead. She hung up on us. We're livid. It's far too late to try calling again, I don't think we'd be able to put up with it again so quickly.

&#x200B;

About an hour later, a supervisor calls us. We initially feel relieved. We tell him what happened and he seems empathetic. We ask again if the credits can be used for the dates we want. He insists they can. We ask him to double check. He does. No problem. Over the course of half an hour, we're able to find a flight we're happy with and decide to book. He says we need to be charged an additional $200 on top of the previous charges. We try to fight the charges and explain that we've been on the phone all day and had such issues that they should just eat the additional charges. He says he can offer us a $150 credit that we can use for our hotel for all the trouble and stress we've been through. We grudgingly agree. He puts us on hold for about 10 minutes to ""finalize everything."" He comes back and says that our credit travel must be COMPLETED by Dec. 31, 2021, so we can't use it for this flight. He cancels the flight and offers us $100 in credit for our trouble and stress. Take note: That's $100 total. Not $150 that he had previously ""given"" us, he downgraded our credit after spending an hour with us on the phone (plus the previously mention 7 hours)! He ""apologizes,"" and we express our disappointment in no uncertain terms. He ""apologizes"" again, blames the airlines, and hangs up.

&#x200B;

We are disgusted by Expedia. They were of no help and wasted an entire day by not knowing their own policies of credit usage. We have no idea if we're going to be able to use our credit at all. We are constrained by government regulations and Expedia's misrepresentation of their own unscrupulous policies.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Spent 8 hours talking to Expedia to redeem Expedia credit. Expedia representative makes constant mistakes, books wrong time for the flight. Supervisor tells us our credits can't be used for what he originally said we could book and cancels our flight. A waste of an entire day.

&#x200B;

Edit/Update: We have finally received a refund for our flights. We have been in constant contact with both Expedia and American Airlines. This was much more work and stress than it should have been. I will never fly American Airlines again if I can help it. They will certainly not get any of my money directly.

At least the American Airlines agents treated us with respect and tried to help us. Expedia did the exact opposite. They blocked us at every opportunity. I will never use Expedia or any of their subsidiaries (Travelocity, Orbitz, [Hotels.com](https://Hotels.com), Vrbo, Hotwire, CheapTickets, HomeAway, Trivago, etc.) ever again.

Expedia,Expedia’s Booking Error Costs Thousands,"A booking confirmation/reservation error through email was made due to Expedia’s negligence and human+system error, which they admitted in the call. At the airport, only my grandmother’s booking worked (we booked her online instead of on the phone), but she is 90 and cannot get on a plane by herself, so she stayed with us. 
We missed the flight and called Expedia. After a lot of haggling, they offered to put us on a flight tomorrow - an offer which they have not yet even emailed to us. But, because my grandmothers booking was successful, we must now re-pay thousands for her ticket, a hotel, overdue parking, dog hotel late fees, not to mention that we will be missing work. 
Is it worth it to re-call and at least see if we get either my grandmother’s ticket or a hotel of their choice covered? The person who talked to us was very confused and gruff. 
Yes, they will technically deliver to us what was lost (three tickets), but we did not just order random plane tickets, we ordered plane tickets on a certain date at a certain time. They did not fulfill this.
It infuriates me that they don’t need to take this responsibility, but I feel like there’s nothing I can do but grit my teeth and accept that I will be paying thousands for their mistake.

Of course, Expedia had pictures and names of each type of room (with different rates obviously) and I chose the club room because it had a balcony. Fast forward to day of check in- I was told the club room does not have a balcony and that I was thinking of the grand room. I had no choice but to take what they gave me.

Expedia,Expedia is like a girlfriend/boyfriend for the good times.,"Expedia is a company comparable to a girl or boy friend for the good times.As you make a reservation with them pray that everything goes to plan because, they will be nowhere to be found if something goes wrong. I booked a flight for a very important wedding in New York on 08/14/21. I had planned to go to the wedding and return the same day. Expedia connected me to American Airlines flight that would have a two hours layover in Washington DC before New York. The return flight to Cleveland would have the same 2 hours layover in DC. On the D-Day, I woke up at 5am in order to catch my flight to DC. We arrived in DC at 8am waited 2 hours to catch the New York flight at 10am. The flight to New York for 08/14/21 was cancelled by American Airlines and there was no other flight to New York that day so I waited 10 hours to catch my return flight to Cleveland. When I contacted American Airlines for my refund, they directed me to Expedia since I bought my ticket through them. Trying to get a full refund from Expedia has been a nightmare. I have not been able to talk with a human being since 08/14/21, today is 08/17/21. When I go to their website to request for a refund, they always connect me to chat with AI but to no avail. I have been promised on 3 separate occasions that an agent will get back to me in 24 hours to help with the refund but that has proved to be a lie on 3 occasions. What surprised me even more was the fact that Expedia had no idea that my flight to New York was cancelled; had to wait hours on each chat for that to be investigated. This is my first social media post. I am going to post on all the platforms until I get the attention of a human being over there.

Expedia,Has anyone successfully argued with Expedia?!,"I am so so annoyed. 

I just re-booked the trip I made last year, which was canceled due to COVID. I had 4 airline credits, but chose to only use two for this trip since one was for a very pricey airline and the credits were only like $179. So, I still have $400 worth of credits to apply to this trip I re-booked. 

I spent WEEKS on the expedia website reading about how to use them. So, I log on and click ""use credit"" once I have all my flights ready to go. I was disconnected from agents TWICE for not responding within 30 seconds of their messages. I was concerned about losing the flights so I moved forward with booking. 

Come to find out, despite it not being anywhere I can find on their website, that I needed to work with an agent to use that credit BEFORE I booked the flight?! Any response I get from their customer service is robotic, and unhelpful.

Apparently they refunded the ticket to my credit card but I didn’t see it and I’m looking for it and I don’t see the charge either for the original ticket even though they gave me a confirmation number and everything .

Expedia,"Naive question: If I cancel through the airline, will the money come to me or Expedia?","I bought Delta tickets through Expedia for a conference that got cancelled. I made sure to buy them to tiers so they were refundable, as clearly advertised in Expedia. Long and behold, expedia customer service says they can only give me expedia credit and that if I want a refund I need to contact the airline...

Delta isn't taking calls for flights that are more than 3 days away but I seem to be able to cancel online. Last step seems to be selecting if I want airline credit or ""**I want a refund to my original form of payment"".** This is dumb, but since I cant talk to an airline representative rn, and it seems like expedia is already trying to pull a fast one, I was wondering whether this ""original form of payment"" would actually be registered to expedia or be my same credit card. Just wanna cover my basis before hitting the submit on a $600 refund. If anybody has carried this through all the way, I would appreciate the help. Thanks!  


EDIT1: Solved. It wasn't reddit or delta that helped me, but I realized that if Delta ever got access to my credit card then it would show up on my statement. Indeed, My cc statement detailed three charges regarding this, one by expedia and two by delta. I went ahead and submitted the reimbursement through the Delta website.

CONTEXT! So I'm in Tegucigalpa (Honduras) and booked a flight to London (to go on the 1 of April and return on the 20) when my country started the lockdown I called the airline to get some information, they told me I can change my flight without penalty except for the difference of the price on my new ticket OR I can wait until 5 days before my flight to call again, because the airline needs to be sure than the flight is going to be cancel.

It got cancel! Then I received an email of Expedia saying ""We gave you a credit with this airline!"" So like the voucher. Today I called at night (the Honduran number) and asked about the credit, they told than yes I can saved it for future travels (but I'll guess only for 12 months after my initial flight) OR I CAN GET MY REFUND! because the flight was cancelled!

She told me to go to [prefunds.aa.com](https://prefunds.aa.com/refunds/) and put my ticket's number, full the format and wait for 5-7 days.

Apparently, they'll give me an answer, then I could get my refund between 5-7 or 2 months, depends of my bank.

Expedia,"18 months later, 9 calls (to Expedia) 5 calls to the Airline, 3 emails, 5 hour wait times on hold, and still no refund. AVOID EXPEDIA AT ALL COSTS."," United Airlines (booked through Expedia) unilaterally cancelled my flight (LAX - Melbourne) in March of 2020 when 'rona hit, and did not offer a replacement flight.

I'm accordingly entitled to a full refund. Not a voucher; a full refund.

I attempted to submit a claim on United's website. It was declined. I rang United and they told me this was because it was booked via Expedia so they have to process it as they booked it.

Each time I call Expedia, I wait several hours (most recent call was a **5 hour** hold time, I kid you not) before speaking to a representative in some offshore call center, who (after half an hour of back and forth) always assures me it's been done, and 'can take up to 12 weeks to process.' 

Cue me checking bank details for 3 months for nothing, followed by calling again, sitting on hold for several hours for the exact same response (it's been done, wait 12 weeks).

When I call United, they tell me nothing has been done 'on their system' and they're still waiting for contact from Expedia, and I need to go through Expedia.

This has been happening like clockwork now every 2-3 or so months.

I'm now up to 9 calls to Expedia alone, and 5 to the Airline over 16 months, emails and calls assuring me it's been done, and it never actually is. My most recent Email was this:



>“Subject: Your cancellation confirmation for your Expedia   itinerary 752624\*\*\*\* Hello \*\*\*\*\*, Thank you for contacting Expedia.I've   gone ahead and canceled your flight and you'll receive a refund as   follows:Refund date: May 05, 2021Current ticket value: AUD 1,257.30 per   travelerCancellation fee: AUD 0.00 per travelerRefund amount: AUD 1,257.30   per travelerTotal refund amount: {currency} {total amount}Card used: Visa   ending in ,\*\*\*\*\* expiring \*\*\*\*\* Since the refund is coming from United   Airlines and not Expedia, you can reach out to them directly if you have any   refund questions.It can take up to 12 weeks for the funds to show up in your   account, depending on the airline and your bank.Thanks for choosing Expedia.”

After waiting the 12 weeks, I reached out to the Airline, who again told me 'it doesnt appear on their system and they cant do anything unless it comes from Expedia'.

I again contacted Expedia (3 hours hold time) and this time demanded a three way call (me, them and United) which while they obliged, Expedia didnt let me actually listen to (again - after another hour on hold). 

After the Expedia rep spoke to United, I was again assured by Expedia it had been done. Only 15 days to wait this time. It felt like some progress had been made.

Then today, I get this from United:

&#x200B;

>Thank you for contacting United Refunds.  
>  
>We would like to advise you of the following:  
>  
>Our records indicate the above referenced ticket was not issued via United Airlines. In accordance with our refund policy, also published on United.com, kindly submit your request to your Travel Agent.  
>  
>Thank you for choosing United Airlines. We look forward to serving you again soon.

 Calling the airline is a waste of time, as they tell me they will only speak to to Expedia, and the Expedia call center just keep fobbing me off as well, and failing to identify that there is a problem and getting it sorted.

Expedia and the airlines are using our money as a piggy bank to get them through COVID and it's disgusting.

Expedia,Expedia CA refunded my CAD1000+ Korean Air flight on the spot,"So I have booked a flight on Feb 2020 to Malaysia from Toronto via Korean Air for May until July 2020 costing for about $1100+. I did not opt in for their travel insurance safety thingy and still got refunded. This is what I did:

First, I call them up on their 800 469 1793 number on a Tuesday, waiting time about 5 mins. At this point, I already got their email months ago saying that they are providing me airline credit instead and cannot be refunded. I gave up calling them in April as it was a shitstorm then and no one answered anyways. 

So I talked to an agent and said I'm aware of the credit but I want refund instead. So she checked and lo and behold she saif because I did not opt in for the insurance plan on the website she can't give me refund, she can only give me airline credit. Ok, i thought oh shoot my bad. Then I asked what's the expiration date for the airline credit. October 2020... Hell na... mandem be joking, I aint planning my travel in one month???

So i hang up the phone and ranted on Twitter (as all Karens should) and someone reached out to me to contact them again and ask for a manager or supervisor. So I did and they refund me in less than 5 mins. With refund invoice emailed to me on the spot. They did mention it might take 6-8weeks but it came in about 2 days after I call so I'm happy.

But I'm still not going to choose Expedia to travel in the future sorry. Maybe low cost airlines?

Expedia,Expedia is going to refund my flight,"I'm writing for everyone who has booked flights from Expedia and are in the midst of trying to get their flights canceled and refund for whatever reasons it may concern.

just 5 minutes ago I got a call from Expedia saying that they will refund my money for a flight from Singapore to Fukuoka I requested to cancel.

but not before long and persistent calls and emails made to Expedia by me.

I've been trying to contact Expedia since 19th Feb 2020 with regards to a flight rearranged by Vietnam airlines which greatly impacted my travel plans. In summary, they were going to make me wait for more than 36 hours at the airport for a connecting flight.

Since then I made calls after calls requesting for a refund or a flight change but Expedia kept asking me to wait.

Frustrated and since my flight is just 2 weeks away, today I contacted Vietnam Airlines directly by email.

Within an hour my flight itinerary was canceled but they wanted me to contact Expedia to get my refund since the money is with them.

Immediately I emailed Expedia customer service informing them that my flight itinerary no longer exists within the Vietnam Airlines booking system.

After about an hour I received a call from Expedia (an Arizona phone call made to Singapore) informing me that I will be getting a full refund which will take 6 to 8 weeks to process.

In my experience, Expedia did make me wait and also very anxious about the whole situation for so long but their customer service was still polite in all the calls and emails I made to them.

Expedia,"email from Expedia: ""Subject: American Airlines changed your flight details. Do you accept?""","Over a week ago my wife booked flights on American Airlines via Expedia from Madison WI to Boston for the two of us so we can visit our daughter later this summer.

For privacy purposes, I'm not going to share the exact dates/times. Our flight was scheduled for several months from now. The overall visit is only 4 days including travel time. She chose the day-of-week combination to get the best fares. The departure from Madison was fairly early in the morning so we would arrive before noon. The return flight left Boston after 6:00 PM, so we'd have most of that day with our daughter.

Yesterday, 6/14, my wife received an email from Expedia announcing American Airlines has changed our flights (Subject: American Airlines changed your flight details. Do you accept?). The changes cut more than a day out of our visit. Instead of arriving before noon, we would arrive late in the evening (11 PM) and instead of leaving late in the afternoon, our new flight is set to leave Boston fairly early in the morning. So we lose the first half day and all of the 4th day due to the flight changes.

BTW, these flights had a stopover in Philadelphia, so there were 4 different flight numbers (2 going and 2 returning). All 4 of these flights were changed.

The Expedia emails say-

""American Airlines changed your itinerary and did their best to find an alternative with minimal disruption to your trip:

\* Changed the departure time for 4 of your flights.  
\* Changed the arrival time for 4 of your flights.  
\* Changed the flight number for 4 of your flights.

It is important that we confirm your acceptance of this change as soon as possible. Please review the updated itinerary and click I ACCEPT below.""

At the bottom of this email, there are buttons for 'I Accept' or 'Cancel Flight'

Just above these buttons is the statement ""Please click ""Accept"" if you agree to the change. If you prefer to cancel, please click ""Cancel Flight"". Due to Covid-19, the airline is offering a refund. With many flights canceled due to COVID-19, there are limited options available. We have explored all possible options and these are the best options that airlines have offered for your booking.""

Before making a decision, we reviewed our options. We were disappointed that a significant chunk of time was being cut out of our visit with our daughter. We found flights with a different airline for a slightly higher fare but at least we'd retain our original visit time. To get more information, we tried contacting both Expedia and American Airlines. Expedia defers everything to the airline. American Airline's customer service is/was useless. There's a toll-free number but the estimated wait time for speaking with a human is over 2 hours.

So we decided to cancel. We booked flights with a different airline and paid about $60 more overall but will now be able to spend more time with our daughter.

My wife received another email confirming the cancelation. However, they are not giving us a refund. Instead, we get a credit with American Airlines that is valid for a limited period of time. We haven't received any details of this credit yet.

Based on the previous information in Expedia's email, we expected a refund but have since learned that it depends on the airline's policy.

I can understand a credit if the time change was insignificant but a change that really alters your time of visit by almost a third should be refunded. We aren't planning any other trips for this year, so the credit isn't very helpful. We've really only budgeted this single trip for this year and next.

Does anyone know if there is any way to apply for a refund instead of the credit?

According to the US Dept. of Transportation 4/3/20 notice - [https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-department-transportation-issues-enforcement-notice-clarifying-air-carrier-refund](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-department-transportation-issues-enforcement-notice-clarifying-air-carrier-refund), we should be getting a refund.

Expedia,My goodbye DM to Expedia,"After a recent horrible experience with Expedia trying to get a flight date changed so I could attend my Dad's funeral I received a DM on Twitter from ""Expedia Help"" which I had requested help from 10 days earlier.  My travel was already finished by that point.  

Scenario:  I need to change return date for my family's trip.  Simple, right?  Nope.

Called support multiple times over 2 days.  Each time was advised of at least 7 hours wait time (usually it said 8).  Last time I waited over 9 hours and finally someone answered.  Spoke to agent for a couple of minutes.  She put me on hold to contact American Airlines and guess what?  I was disconnected.  Called back and was put in queue again with ""8 hour"" estimated wait time.  

Tried online chat a bunch of times.  Nobody to chat with.  Tried different customer service numbers I found online but all dumped into the same call queue.  Tried Expedia Help on Twitter which claims 24/7 customer support.  Like I said above they did an amazing job of sending me a generic message 10 DAYS after I sent them a DM.  My trip was over by then.  Useless.

Below is my goodbye message to Experian.  I sent it in response to that DM from Expedia Help on Twitter:

***My trip has already been completed.  I do not understand why Expedia takes 10 days to respond to a DM with its ""24/7 "" Twitter support.  I also don't understand why I waited over 9 hours on the phone for a support rep, only to be disconnected when the rep was looking something up.  I also don't understand why online chat doesn't work.  I also don't understand why Expedia is making no public statement to its customers about the support situation despite complaints here and other social media.  And after over 20 years using Expedia I don't understand why I should ever use it again.***",6,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/o0mis0/my_goodbye_dm_to_expedia/,2021-06-15 19:30:48,Expedia

interestingly their annual report to shareholders state their refund practices (good info for class action lawyers): ""  Our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply, occupancy and ADRs, decreases in airline capacity, periodically rising airline ticket prices, or the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, all of which we have experienced historically. Other factors that could negatively affect our business include:

* Significant changes in oil prices;
* Continued air carrier and hotel chain consolidation;
* Reduced access to discount airfares;
* ....
* Health-related risks, such as the Ebola, H1N1, SARs and avian flu outbreaks.

Such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services. This decrease in demand, depending on its scope and duration, together with any future issues affecting travel safety, could significantly and adversely affect our business, working capital and financial performance over the short and long-term. In addition, the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events, such as severe weather conditions, actual or threatened terrorist activity or war, could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity if we, as we have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions, provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets, hotel reservations and other travel products and services""",20,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/fknqo4/how_to_boycott_expedia_aka_screw_expedia_book/,2020-03-18 11:00:32,Expedia
Expedia,Never booking in Expedia again,"So I have credit from a cancelled flight last year. I wanted to use it to get it over and done with. In hindsight, I should've prepared myself mentally for this.

I had wait 5 hours for someone to pickup the phone queue, only for it to be hung up mid transaction.

 I don't know why I decided to give it another go and so this time it was another 2 hour wait. The consultant took all my details and everything was going smoothly. Only to be met with 'I'm sorry sir, we can't process your flight bookings right now as the system won't let us"".

Is this a fucking joke? The flight is for end of May and I can't make a fucking booking for something that's within a month's time. The only recommendation is to wait a week to see ""what happens"" like they don't have an clue what the fuck is going on. I went off at them as the previous consultant was happy to take my fucking payment already. But somehow in the 2 hours some unknown issue has arisen.

Really appalling service. And never again going with this shitty third-party company. I've already bombarded their social media. It's probably going to ignored with the hundred of messages saying the exact same thing about their service. I hope this company goes down the ground.

UPDATE: I don’t know why I decided to call them in the evening but I got into a 30 min queue and the lady managed to make the booking in less than 10 mins. Thank god it was a quick a resolution.

Expedia,"If you want to fly, do not book your flight with Expedia.","I bought a US flight with Expedia. I have a receipt and confirmation. Few days before departure I received an email from the airline company (JetBlue) saying ""my itinerary was cancelled"". I did not cancel my flight. I called the airline and they said it WAS CANCELED BY EXPEDIA. I called Expedia and their agent was not able to explain what happened, but she confirmed it was canceled.

Expedia did not offer any help. I had to buy a new ticket (directly with the airline), it was more expensive and less convenient since it was last minute.

I tried contacting Expedia after my trip, but guess what, their chat was too busy and so were phone lines. The only email contact listed on their website was for issues regarding web security. I decided this was a security issue since no one can explain who canceled my flight, if it was a glitch in their website programing or an employee with a sick sense of humor?

Expedia,Refund for a KLM credit (flights booked through Expedia for TD),"I booked a flight for my friend's wedding (planned for April 2020), and KLM  cancelled the flights due to the pandemic. I purchased the ticket (worth over $900CAD) in the summer of 2019, forgoing any cancellation insurance (hindsight is 20/20).

I have spoked with Expedia for TD, and they have informed me they cannot provide a refund, and that the credit needs to be used by June 2021; this is the airline's policy, and they must follow the rules 1:1. Any communication with KLM leads me back to Expedia for TD since I booked through a third party. I live in Canada and we are still on lockdown due to COVID with no end to travel restrictions in sight.

A potential obstacle: I did a product transfer with TD (TD Rewards Visa to a TD Aeroplan Visa, same card #) before the credit was granted, so I no longer have online access to the Expedia for TD website (Aeroplan won't allow it).

Has anyone who has booked through Expedia (for TD) or any third party agent been able to receive a cash refund?

Expedia,The airlines offering full refunds where Expedia will not,"Like a lot of people, the pandemic caused my family to have to cancel or postpone upcoming travel plans.    What we have found is that flights booked through Expedia were often not fully refunded or credited. In fact once my wife was told that her credit was not worth the same value by dollar as what some flights costs.     For example, let’s say we had a credit for $400.00 and wanted to buy a ticket that was shown as available for $400.00. Expedia would say “Oh your price isn’t $400.00 for that ticket. It’s 475.00”  - Crazy and sketch right?    And when we tried to get a refund we’d only get half or some part of the money back.  Not all.


When we called Delta and Alaska directly to get refunded for the same flights that Expedia gave us the runaround on,  we were immediately refunded in full! No questions asked. 

So my advice is always check with the airlines if Expedia give you strange information or try to short change you.",3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/lfgzdg/the_airlines_offering_full_refunds_where_expedia/,2021-02-08 17:34:19,Expedia
Expedia,Complete Expedia Mayhem,"Long story LONG, 

booked a flight with Alaska Airlines through Expedia and the returning flight was changed. There was 1 Layover that was scheduled to land at layover airport at 12pm. They changed my second flight to an 8am take off time. Obviously this is physically impossible to catch. So I called (multiple times) Expedia for help. They said all they can do is refund me (which is not reasonable considering the ticket prices have tripled) OR give me a flight that starts at 8am with 2 stops and gets in around 10 pm, making me miss work. Understanding things happen and the current operator could not help me further, I asked to speak to a supervisor which they explained would have to call me back within the next 24 hours. Okay, no problem... No call back in 4 business days. 

I call back , on hold for 2 hours , they pick up tell me the same spiel and then tell me they will contact Alaska for me so please stay on the line. 3 hours and 40 min TOTAL later.....call dropped.

&#x200B;

I am having a fun time here. If any one has any kind of advice for me I would greatly appreciate it.

Expedia,Another issue with Expedia Credit.,"Hey there,
If anyone has any ideas what I can do to possibly get a refund, please let me know. Due to the covid spikes in Washington state we have decided to cancel our travel plans and want to play it safe. We were told we can contact the airlines directly to get a refund in credit, but after hearing all the horror stories and having my mother-in-law struggle to use her airline credit over the phone, I am hoping to get a real refund.

I am debating contacting my bank as expedia support and those at the airlines do not offer refunds at this time. Has anyone had any luck with this?

Also, it seems insane to me that not only is just credit offered but that it is time-locked and when people have tried to use it they get jerked around and charged extra. Seems shady.

Expedia,Expedia offers airline credit but I want a full refund,"So I booked a trip via Expedia - it was to El Salvador with Avianca. Sometime during March I got a notice that the flight has been canceled and Avianca gave me two options - refund/credit. If I decided to get credited, I could've received more, but I opted out because I wanted to get a full refund.

Yesterday, I finally got an email from Expedia (after so many unfruitful attempts to cancel from their website) saying that I can cancel it and I'd get credit with Avianca. 

If my understanding is correct, I'm entitled to a full refund because of the coronavirus situation but Expedia isn't giving me this option... What can I do in this case?

Expedia,Honestly f*ck Expedia.,"Bare with me because this is an honest review from my own personal experience why Expedia is utter dog sh*t. 

I used Expedia to book a hotel 2 months ago in March for around $500. The hotel said they cancelled all bookings when I got there. I never got an email from Expedia with a notice about this. Like WTF? The hotel told me I would have to contact Expedia for a refund since I bought it through them instead of using the directly, which makes sense so I tried to contact Expedia. I could not get a hold of Expedia. It’s been 2 fucking months and I still cannot get in contact with them for my refund. At this point I’ve came to terms I probably lost the money which sucks but I’m honestly more angry at Expedia’s SH*T customer service. Shady ass company. I understand it’s a lot more difficult during this time of pandemic. But there is a minimum degree of service any company should provide. Expedia has proved me wrong. That threshold for them does not exist. If it wasn’t already clear, I will never EVER use Expedia again and will tell everyone to stay clear of this shit company. I am not joking I have already bought put options on this company because I seriously think they are a garbage company in the way they’ve dealt with itineraries during the pandemic. They are currently seeking private equity because they know they are under huge pressure. I have NEVER in my entire 24 years of living wrote a negative review for ANY company even if they were a bad company. It’s sad that my experience with Expedia was so incredibly horrendous that I decided to fucking find the Expedia subreddit just so I could post a bad (but honest) review.

Honestly. Fuck you Expedia.

Expedia,Less Hassle for Expedia Hotel Refunds,"Obligatory throwaway account.

This advice works primarily for hotels that are offering unrestricted cancellations due to COVID-19.

TL;DR: Get confirmation in writing from hotel. Make it easy on the call centre agent.

&#x200B;

1. Directly call the property you booked and let them know that you'd like to cancel an Expedia booking.
2. Ask the hotel to make a note in your guest file that your cancellation was approved. Make sure that the note can be accessed by front desk staff in case reservations staff are not available.
3. Use Expedia's contact page \[expedia.ca/service/\] to request a callback. In step 1, pick any combination of options OTHER THAN ""Change & Cancel"". I used ""Other - Payment"". Skip straight to step 3 and enter your phone number.
4. Wait for a call. When prompted, pick the option that gets you an agent. Wait again.
5. Confirm your itinerary and info with the agent. When the agent asks what you'd like to do, tell them that you've contacted the property directly for cancellation approval and have it on your file. Let them confirm with the hotel. If they can't get in contact with reservations, ask them to call again to have the front desk check your file.
6. Continue with the agent and confirm your cancellation. Wait for your cancellation email confirmation. You're done!

[Callback form](https://preview.redd.it/i8jvm2710rn41.jpg?width=2736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54e1279c533f7736701c654b1cb702552dca2443)

My cancellation was for a non-refundable stay at a hotel for work. Total call and waiting time was under 30 minutes - 5 minutes to call hotel, 10 minutes waiting for agent, about 10 minutes talking with agent - over about 4 hours in the evening, most of which was spent figuring out how to even get connected on a call to Expedia. The key to this is making the call easy and streamlined for the agent so you don't get passed on/hung up on/given the general run-around. Also, night time on the Pacific = less easterners calling. West coast best coast.

Expedia,Asiana Airlines booked through Expedia - Are change flight fees refundable when flights are cancelled by the airline itself?,"Hello. I have an upcoming Asiana Airlines flight going to the Philippines, with a 3-hour layover in Incheon. The ticket was purchased through Expedia on November 2019 and was originally scheduled from April 29, 2020 (departing from San Francisco) through May 13, 2020 (departing from Manila). Due to other circumstances, I had to reschedule my flight to an earlier date, April 16. The May 13 return date remained the same. When my tickets were reissued on December 2019, by calling through Expedia also, I had to pay for a $200 change fee plus the fare difference between the April 29 and April 16 departure dates.

Fast-forward to March 16, 2020, Asiana Airlines has cancelled/suspended flights to and from San Francisco-Incheon, effective for flights from April 15 to April 29, 2020 (per their website - Coronavirus). I also received an email informing me of the cancellation of my flight.

My question is, will Asiana Airlines or Expedia refund me the extra fees I paid as a result of rebooking my flight ($200 + fare difference), on top of the original airfare? Had I not changed my flights, my original April 29 departure is still covered in their cancellation announcement.

I will not be using Expedia again for any reason and encourage others to likewise avoid this company who pretends to not even be involved in the transaction (“this is between the airline and me apparently”) despite taking a cut of the ticket price and being the company the business relationship is with.

Expedia,CAUTION! Expedia / Air Canada charging a fee because of COVID 19,"Hi everyone

Just wanted to share my experience with you and hopefully spread the word on how Expedia and Air Canada are ripping people off.

Back in December of 2019 (before Covid) I booked a family trip to New York (from Canada). As the time progressed it was obvious that I would not be able to make that trip, however upon reading all the comments from people my best bet was not to accept any offers or cancellations from Expedia or Air Canada as I would only be eligible for a 12 month credit, but if they canceled on me then I would be entitled to a 24 month credit.

Expedia sent me a couple of emails in the last 3 weeks to get me to accept a connecting flight to New York or cancel the flight altogether. I completely ignored the email until the other day when they finally told me that they canceled the flight on me and that they will email me the details of the credit.

Few more days went by and I haven't heard from them so I emailed them at [support@service.expedia.ca](mailto:support@service.expedia.ca). They replied back to inform me of the airline credit and how I should call them when I am ready. What caught my eyes was the amount of the credit which didn't make sense. They actually shorted me by about $70 and had I not done the math I would have completely missed it.

The following day I emailed them back to ask about the difference in what I paid for the trip and the amount of credit, and they told me that there is a non refundable ticketing service charge. There was no such mention in the fine print because I wasn't the one making the flight cancellation. I've sent them another email to complain and CC'd local news reporter hoping this story gains more ground. If they are doing this to me then they must be doing it to thousands of travelers and pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars.

So my advice to you is to carefully check how much in Credit they are giving back to you!

I quoted the usual regulations (EC261) about the requirement that they provide a refund and not a voucher but the agent wouldn't relent.  She said the only way they could provide an refund is if BA authorized it.  In hindsight, when I spoke to BA, I should have had them updated my PNR (the record locator) to document I was due a refund.  Without it, Expedia was forced to call themselves and get confirmation.

In the end, I got my refund but had I just had BA updated my PNR, I would have saved a few hours more on the phone with Expedia.

TLDR: To get a refund for a cancelled flight from Expedia, call airline at a quiet time, get them to update the PNR to authorize the refund, then call Expedia who can process it",5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/fw5upb/flight_on_ba_cancelled_how_i_got_a_refund_from/,2020-04-06 20:02:14,Expedia

I decided to call them and the guy goes through the whole thing with me and says it shows up as the same price as me.  So I ask him to book it for me.  He tried to do it but says the price has gone up to $4900.  I told him I'd call back to confirm.

I called back the next day and they told me the price went down again.  I'm like great book it.  They go through the whole thing again and say "" oh actually the system is down for some of the airlines"".

Expedia,Expedia reviews - are some fake?,"I stayed at an run down motel in an expensive city last night, it was definitely one of the cheapest options in the entire city(The kind of places that should be $60-$100 per night, not $160-$310, but the market is nuts here!) and I could use my Expedia points for a discount so I went for it. Part of the reason I made my choice was that it had above average reviews on Expedia.ca 

Now that the Expedia asked me for my review I decided to go an read the reviews - and they alternate between 1 and 2 star reviews with an accurate description of the dumpy motel - and 4 or 5 star ones that are completely blank OR have a really generic ""Comfortable spot close to *attraction* or *local transport*.

Expedia,Expedia-Poor Customer Service,"I am drafting this post as I approach the 2 ¾ hour mark on the phone with Expedia, gradually moving up the chain. I am now on hold with corporate.
Let me start by saying that I've been using Expedia nearly exclusively for all of my business and personal travel for the past several years, spending in the 10's of thousands of dollars. If I do not have a satisfactory resolution of the issue that I am dealing with today, I will certainly take %100 of my business elsewhere.
To the issue: On 12/20/17, I phoned Expedia to rebook a flight originally booked on Expedia in October. The flight was for my son to go back and forth to college for his Christmas break. 
My son had to travel ""home"" (1st leg of a round trip ticket) on a different date, and I called to re-book the 2nd leg as I read that airlines often automatically cancel the return flight if the first leg is a ""no show"". I was quoted a sum to change/re-book the flight for his return to school and was provided verbal confirmation that this was done.
Fast forward to yesterday-last night I tried to check him in via the airline and Expedia-and for both, I was given the message that he would have to check in at the airport. Fast forward to this am-my husband takes my son to the airport and when they try to check in, they are told that since the missed the first leg of the flight in December, todays flight was cancelled. After explaining to the ticket agent that I re-booked this flight with Expedia in December to avoid this cancellation, they repeat that they have no record of it, and ultimately re-book a flight for my son tomorrow am for an additional $290.
After lots of back and forth with my husband/son, etc., I called Expedia, and after some time, I'm informed that they are able to verify that I did indeed call and re-booked this flight and for some unknown reason, this transaction was never completed by Expedia.
Again, after hours of back and forth with Expedia (mostly on hold), they refund my $290. I feel that this is the bare minimum they should do to compensate my family for this major inconvenience. (BTW-just hit the 3-hr. mark on the phone and have I've been on hold since I started drafting this post.)
This is not a case of ""airline error"" or an issue with a flight being cancelled by the airline for a weather-related issue. This is clearly and admittedly an Expedia ERROR. 
Expedia-How much do you value me as a customer? I've spend 1/2 of my day off dealing with this.
Quick follow up-apparently, I've reached the highest level and have been offered $200--not acceptable goodbye Expedia.

Expedia,Expedia Bungled Round Trip Ticket Purchase,"I just had a blast ordering a round trip flight through Expedia.

They were supposed to coordinate it so that my flight out of town would be through Spirit, and the return flight home would be booked with Frontier.  Cheap airlines with god awful service, I know.

I carefully reviewed the details and submitted my order.  The ""Please Wait While We Confirm Your Reservations"" screen sat for 3 or 4 minutes - much longer than I expected.  When it finally came back, it displayed a terrifying confirmation:

""Your One-Way Flight has been booked.""

They completely dropped my outbound flight all together.  They sent me an email confirming my 1-way itinerary with Frontier.  Panicked, I called Frontier and immediately canceled the flight.

Trying to ensure they gave me a full refund, I log into my credit card account and find 3 charges.  1 from Expedia ($20 ""non-refundable"" booking fee), 1 from Spirit and 1 from Frontier.

Apparently, Expedia *did* place an order with Spirit, and then completely lost every last detail.  After an hour on the phone with Expedia, the very confused service rep said my order appeared on his screen as a ""Round Trip flight"" but that drilling down to the details only showed my Frontier flight. Which had been canceled by me.

After it was all said and done, Expedia refunded my $20 booking fee.  

I called Spirit directly and they were able to find my flight by Name + Flight Date, and gave me a confirmation number that I can view on their website.

I re-ordered my Frontier flight, this time directly, and saved over $120 for two tickets than what I was originally billed via Expedia.

Expedia,Expedia Experience,"Where to start. I booked a trip through Expedia for a trip to Disney in Orlando for my children christmas present. I purchased the insurance which clearly states that if cancelled or changed before the trip date that there would be no fees and they would reimburse the change flight fees. Not the extra cost of tickets, but the change flight fees. Well, I had to reschedule. Which I did days before the trip. They promptly told me to call Spirit airline and change the flight and call them back with the receipt and they would get the claim together to reimburse the change flight fees. Once I did that and called them they promptly told me that Spirit must email them the receipt as one from me wouldn't work. even tho it was from spirit. They said spirit has the email to send it to. They didn't. I called again and was told to email the reciept and copies of my Credit card statement showing it was paid and they would get on the claim. I did that and? crickets. I called back. They informed me that they never received an email and send it to another address. Did that. Nothing. I called back. They informed me that I needed to contact the insurance company. They provided a number. I called, the insurance company was confused as they were the group that covered on trip medical insurance. But they were quite nice and forwarded me to the correct company who, while also quite nice, informed me that I should never had called spirit as it clearly states on your website that you cover it and handle the change flight as long as it is before the trip is to begin. They had me email the receipt, credit card staements and personel info and said they would do research and someone would call me in 5 days. LOL.. yeah. So here I am the night before I leave and I call pop century to get picked up from the airport. The hotel has no idea who we are. After 5 hours of calling and getting the hotel sort of straightened out I asked about the insurance claim and was informed that there isn't one. The supervisor said that the amount on my receipt for changed flight fees was to much and he wouldn't pay that. i was confused by his statement and asked how much they cover as it clearly says the fees. He woldn't answer me and said the best he could do is $300. My question was if you don't know how much you cover, how can you offer me $300? To which he said he would not give me that and my fight was with the insurance company? Then promptly hung up on me. So here I sit with them not honoring the insurance they sold me. Not even opening a claim. Maybe able to get a ride to the resort, maybe not. And hung up on by the company that has taken my money and quite possibly destroyed my kids Christmas trip. As this was all recorded, Expedia please feel free to listen to it. I was polite, considering, and never once raised my voice. I spent 3 1/2 days on the phone attempting to get this straightened out and basically your employees told me to get bent.

Any recommendations?,"In November of 2019 I booked 2 tickets to fly my in-laws into the US from South Africa in April of 2020. I even purchased the travel insurance, just in case anything happens. March of 2020, COVID hits and the flights are cancelled by SA Airways. Expedia provides a credit but the credit has to be used for the same people going to the same destinations. Well that's basically impossible. SA Airways is under business rescue (their version of bankruptcy) and is not offering international flights. According to Expedia I have until March of next year to use the credit. I have tried everything to just get a refund. I have spoken with their customer service at least half a dozen times. Most recently I tried doing a charge back on the credit card that we booked with but Capital One is saying I would have had to do that within 118 days of whenever the original flight was supposed to be. I have filed a complaint with the Department of Transportation but have received no response. I have emailed the airline directly, no response. 

I just want this money back. They were not cheap flights and with the new COVID variant I don't foresee any travel to or from SA anytime soon. 

Any suggestions? I am at a loss.

Edit: forgot to mention, the insurance does not cover COVID.

Expedia,Got money back on non-refundable hotels,"Hello!

I just wanted to post this in case I could help one person out.

I booked back in January for a trip to Italy in May with Expedia - I selected all non-refundable rooms as 'why the heck would I cancel my trip?'

SO. I'm sure a lot of you are in the same situation so I will cut to the chase: Expedia will only offer you a voucher with hotel ""valid for a year"". In my case I found that there is no point calling them, no point emailing them, they will just repeat the same thing. 

If you want to try and get your money back do the below:

1. Whatever you do, do NOT cancel the booking yourself through Expedia. Do not select the 'voucher' (unless you actually want it)
2. Contact the hotel DIRECTLY. Go onto their website, explain the situation, and ask the hotel to cancel you booking with expedia.
3. I had 4/5 hotels cancel my booking and in my case this triggered a refund of money as it was the hotel who cancelled, 'not me'. 
4. Once the hotel has cancelled the booking, then phone Expedia and ask them to email you a confirmation of the refund. Took almost a month for the funds to be deposited, but I almost cried when I saw my bank account. 

Sorry if this has been posted before, I just wanted to share my experience and hopefully it'll help someone.

I canceled because I was thinking if airline would offer me airline credit i won’t, if they will offer me cash money i will cancel. To be honest, I knew that my ticket with Air France only has airline credit refund option.

But, when I chatted with live support agent and asked him if I’ll get cash or AL credit, he said I’ll get real money in the form of original payment. I was super happy because I spent more than 5k , I said YES. Refund was processed. 

A week passed, I saw airline credit display on my profile. Made me super annoyed and sad. Again chatted with them. I was sure agent will say last agent did mistake. Guess what he also said I’ll get cash money not credit. Now I’m like totally confused, if I’ll get cash money why I can see airline credit in my profile?

The first time she called, the line was disconnected after an hour of waiting on hold. The second time she got someone after 55 minutes and was told to contact the airline directly.

Today she noticed the phone bill of an extra $60 + tax on top of the expected amount.

Expedia,Using Flight Credit Directly Through Airlines?,"So after a TERRIBLE Expedia experience last spring trying to rebook my honeymoon (involving disputing the charge through my credit card company), I vowed never to use Expedia again.

Expedia,Suspicious!!,"Ok so I called Expedia multiple times about my refund. And they sent me an email that says they’d submit the refund request form on my behalf and when I called them today, they told me that I’m not eligible under Air Canada policies which is BS because I am. And that they never even submitted the form for me. Mind you, I HAVE THE PROOF OF THEIR EMAIL. And then I called AC and they told me to called Expedia as usual I’m the tennis ball. So I called Expedia one last time hoping I could get through the agent about the refund and if not, I was thinking of settling with AC voucher. But then, this one in a million “nice” agent picked up and he started filling out the refund request. I knew the deadline was over months ago so I told him about it. He traced back what I talked to other agents on previous calls. And strangely enough, he agreed with me that I’m actually eligible for refund. So I gave him my credit card info(I requested to be refunded to a different card and not the one I paid for the cancelled trip - is it even possible normally?). The agent told me to wait 4-8 weeks for refund. And to reach out to them in a few weeks if refund is not processed. Now here’s the thing, even air canada itself isn’t refunding anyone. I’m sure he is aware of the deadline too since I told him. I dunno what expedia is trying to pull off. Or was he a genuine nice agent? I see no way they can submit my refund request - AC had closed the submission off months ago. So either, its them who is refunding me or they are trying to delay so that I can’t revert my credits to voucher? Is that a new dirty trick? Sry but I have zero trust in them after everything I went through. Should I wait for the refund like he said or should I go for voucher while it’s still an option? 

PS: I recorded our call. Also, I sighed rlly rlly rlly long when the call started before speaking and the agent had to ask if I’m okay lol - I was so done with expedia and literally every third party even AC at that point.",7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/pwzsdh/suspicious/,2021-09-28 05:50:21,Expedia

The next day I contact Expedia, first Expedia say they will process the refund but need to get a hold of Fox first, they couldn't, so they said will contact me in 24 hrs, and then next day saying they are unable to contact Fox, then finally say the rental reservation is ""non-refundable"".

It was originally a flight from Boston to Munich on Lufthansa, where I would transfer to an Air Dolomites (a company which is wholly owned by Lufthansa) flight to Verona. Instead of letting me use the credit to go from Boston to Verona on an identical booking, which would use the whole credit, they won’t let me and are instead forcing me to pick a destination in Germany (most of which require atleast 1 stopover which is so short that I would probably miss the next fligjt) and nowhere else. These flights won’t even use up half the credit, which means I essentially gave 2600$ to someone expecting to get either a flight or a full refund, they ripped up half of it, and offered to let me use the other half on a flight to somewhere I don’t want to go, and have the opportunity to miss the flights because I only got 45 min to try to go from one end of the airport in Paris to another. They’ve said about 500 times that I am fully entitled to a refund, and that my request is processing (yeah right, I put that request in last March. You’ve had almost 2 years to process it).

I contact Expedia and get sent to VRBO, after being thrown around from department to department, I'm told by an employee that they can only relocate Expedia reservation, and for people who get stranded, and since I haven't gone to the destination yet, I'm not stranded....yet.

So, the employee also tells me that even though I've made a reservation with Expedia it can be booked through VRBO, and be given VRBO support because they are all the same company but that because my reservation is VRBO it doesn't have relocation right....makes sense? Not to me.

In summary, Expedia allowed a cancellation of a Non Refundable, and it is letting time pass to find options ONLY when I get stranded tomorrow...

I’m visiting Orlando to visit my girlfriend and had highly anticipated this trip.

The whole ordeal put me through an hour and a half of deliberation and the best resolution I got was simply to book with an airport rental company. I have yet to hear back about my case or receive a refund or any form of assistance. Shame on Expedia on every level from listing an unreputable rental company on their site, poor agents who were obviously just as clueless as I was, and the company for not following up or even providing me with a refund after a week.

We were to drive up on Sunday and drive back on Tuesday. We figured we'd get a hotel on the way back in NJ and drive half way on Monday night. 

Hurricane henri looked like it was headed to eastern CT on Sunday evening. So we bought the hotel insurance just incase. Right in the insurance documents it says cancellation due to a hurricane are covered.

Sat afternoon the funeral director canceled the funeral due to the hurricane (it was an outdoor service and the forecast had henri going directly where we were headed). So I canceled the reservation and made an insurance claim on sat evening. 

Fast forward to today. Claim denied. Adjuster said since the hurricane had not hit land when we filed the claim thus I was denied.

Once we book it, we would not cancel, but we are worried that Spain might change their COVID-19 policies. Our trip is only planned for a few days, and if Spain were to change their COVID policies and enforce a mandatory quarantine upon arrival, our trip would be pointless.  We were wondering what the refund policy of Expedia is regarding trips affected in such a way by COVID-19? Would we lose our money on the tickets or would we be able to get a refund, or at the very least be able to push the trip to a later date? Thanks for any help!",3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/riatg1/covid_refund_policy/,2021-12-17 06:13:10,Expedia
Expedia,Transfer Ownership of Listed Property,I've recently bought an apartment that's listed on Expedia and would like to continue the business. Is it possible to transfer the ownership of the listing from the account of the previous owner to mine? I can't find any info about this on Expedia. Any tips are greatly appreciated.

Expedia,Over 3 hrs and still waiting,"     As stated on the title, we've been waiting on hold now for over 3 hrs waiting to speak to someone so we can cancel out flight. We called Japan airlines but they said we had to contact Expedia. I also tried cancelling my flight on the website but it stated that it's somehow unable to cancel online and I had to call.

     I understand that they are busy but this is insane! Just for the heck of it, we used another phone to call Expedia but this time, we chose the option to buy and in less than 2 mins, the phone was picked up. We told the person on the other line that we were cancelling and she put us on hold. Meanwhile, we've been listening to this awful on-hold music  that they have on the other line for hours  now.",4,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/fhb8sf/over_3_hrs_and_still_waiting/,2020-03-12 05:10:55,Expedia

Expedia,I finally got my money back.,"I scheduled a vacation through expedia back in July.  The trip was cancelled due to covid reasons when the airline started canceling flights. The travel insurance I purchased denied my request for reimbursement saying I was the one who chose not to go. I immediately filed a chargeback with my credit card since expedia kept giving me the runaround.  I'm pretty sure they were trying to run out the clock so i couldn't file the chargeback. Just recently the chargeback finally came back in my favor.  My advice to this sub, if expedia will not work with you make them work with your credit card company, file the chargeback.",8,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/qbyymz/i_finally_got_my_money_back/,2021-10-20 11:46:25,Expedia

Expedia,Any experience with AIG insurance claim?,"I booked a trip that had to be canceled due to medical reasons. We paid for the trip protection on Expedia’s site. 

We did all the steps including doctors notes etc. Our claim was approved by AIG. 

They said they send a check to Expedia and the refund will come from them. 

But when I log in it’s trip credit. 

I have called once and the person didn’t really seem to understand my question much less answer it. 

Does anyone know if we should get credit back or a refund? Seems like if Expedia receives a check from AIG we should get a check back and not airline credit. 

I have read the policy page a few times and can’t find a clear answer.

Expedia,Funny Story: How I Booked a Top-Rated Non Existing Hotel on Hotels.com,"So I have this funny story for you Reddit people. This can also be a precaution for you.

TL;DR: I have booked a hotel that doesn't exist in real life but was top-rated on [Hotels.com](https://hotels.com/). I have shared this story with probably 10+ members of customer success at [Hotels.com](https://hotels.com/) but I believe you also deserve this.

Short info, I'm a Silver member of [hotels.com](https://hotels.com/) with a one night free stay worth of $115.56 (because that was the average of my first 10 reservations) and I also have a 25€ coupon that is about to expire that they gave me because of something similar last year.

So I am within my extra extended stay in Istanbul, you know because Covid and flights. So I went out with a lady and the night was going great. So I stayed with her until the public transportation was over and decided to book a room from [hotels.com](https://hotels.com/) app. I was in Beyoglu and so opened the app, listed the hotels from top to bottom with ratings. Booked a room at Wings of Pera, which was listed at the top at [hotels.com](https://hotels.com/) iOS app. This has happened on August 9 at 2:11 AM (Local Istanbul time). I paid the full fare $32.64 in advance.

When I went to the address that is shown on [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com/) directory (the address is consistent with Google search) I saw there was not a hotel. I am adding the photos of the address and the beautiful door of a random apartment that is located where the hotel must have been.

Address

[https://imgur.com/4XX717N](https://imgur.com/4XX717N)

Hotel door

[https://imgur.com/PmEBpGR](https://imgur.com/PmEBpGR)

After circling around the address for 15-20 mins, I tried to call the number on [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com/) and no one answered. Then I called the number listed on Google search (it is different than what is listed on [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com/)), and a big surprise but no one answered that phone as well.

I had to take a cab to Asian side of Istanbul for almost half of what hotel cost me. While on taxi, I wrote to [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com/) from the chat feature on app. The problem wasn’t resolved.

Then since Sunday morning (Aug 10), I have been talking to [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com/) support team on Twitter. I am being asked to check in again the following day to see if there was an update on issue. Super annoyed by this attitude because I'm asked to check the next day but nothing happens in terms of a resolve in this matter. I am being told that [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com/) is waiting for an e-mail from the hotel (Which I am convinced doesn’t exist out of a scam scheme). I don’t know how long is the regular waiting protocol or what happens if they don’t respond at all!

Then, I was suggested to mail the problem to a mail address at hotels.com. My e-mail went to a hole in outer space. Hopefully it will be retrieved in the future.

So basically my problem is, I booked a hotel on [hotels.com](http://hotels.com/) app that doesn’t exist and paid full in advance. Then, I had to incur an unnecessary cab expense. Then, I am spending my time to tell this story over and over and to learn if an e-mail was sent by the hotel management (Uhm, does it even exist?)

I guess it would be much easier to open a dispute at the bank with no headaches and all, but I just wanted to share this beautiful story with you too dear Reddit people. I am assuming the majority of [Hotels.com](https://hotels.com/) customer success team is also working from home, but it would be a great office talk that a random dude booked a hotel in Istanbul that doesn’t even exist. You know what’s funnier? That hotel was the highest rated hotel in [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com/) directory. Spread the laugh on behalf of me.

Travel safe and make your diligence beforehand.",2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/ibzb9l/funny_story_how_i_booked_a_toprated_non_existing/,2020-08-18 11:34:08,Booking.com
Expedia,Scammed by wotif/expedia,"So this has been written for VCAT and as I've explained this to #ACCC #VictorianPolice
#VCAT
#WOTIF
#ServicedApartmentsMelbourne 
#Expedia
#creditcard
In several formats and wotif couldn't be less helpful if they tried, I've put this online in the attempt to get justice but maybe at the least prevent scammer's advertising accommodation through these multi million/billion dollar companies. So in the famous word's of Slick Rick the Ruler 

""Here We Go""

20/05/2021t
Booked apartment in Melbourne via Wotif.com for the dates of 25/06/2021 to 5/07/2021 and paid 
$1180.00 in full.
25/06/2021 (Day 1 of 10 – arrival day)
Serviced Apartments Melbourne (Agent) contacted us via phone to request a security deposit of 
$300.00 to be paid immediately, and a copy of a Drivers licence be provided to them immediately. 
This occurred on the day of our arrival from Canberra to Melbourne. We questioned this process 
and advised we were happy to do so upon arrival as this was noted on our booking confirmation and 
is usually standard industry practice. We were advised this was conditional of receiving the code and 
key collection details for our apartment. We reluctantly complied as it was the day of 
accommodation and would have lost our full cost of $1180.00 for the apartment if we refused.
After flying in to Melbourne from Canberra, we collected the key from the nominated location of 
*Liquorologist (a bottleshop on Elizabeth Street not far from Empire Apartment Building on A’Becket 
Street). Upon entering room 1708 we were immediately struck with an odour which permeated 
from the apartment. Once we entered the apartment, we were struck with the realisation that it 
looked nothing like the advertised apartment. Upon closer inspection, we also noticed there was 1 
bathroom missing as we had paid for a 2bedroom apartment with 2 bathrooms to accommodate our 
family. We also noticed the apartment appeared to be in extreme disrepair. The kitchen had 
exposed wiring hanging down from the splashback, the soft furnishings were covered in stains and 
burn marks, the counter tops and table tops were in disrepair showing signs of severely peeling paint 
and burn marks. The carpet was filthy with black stains all over the once cream coloured floor 
covering. There appeared to be some kind of blood or body fluid splattered on one of the bedroom 
walls, and there were also small holes in one of the walls and other severe wear and tear I’ve never 
seen before. This was enough for us to attempt to contact the Agent to discuss the issues.
5.31pm we called the mobile number provided on our booking confirmation (0410 352 417) twice. 
However, we later discovered this was the cleaner and not the Agent.
5.33pm we attempted to call the Agent (03-9855 8868) twice. They didn’t answer the phone and a 
voicemail advising office hours were 9am to 7pm Monday to Saturday, and to call back during 
business hours. This was frustrating for us as we were calling during their nominated business 
hours, and we needed to rectify the situation. 
5.35pm we located the Agent website and called them on another phone number as listed there 
(1300-599 650) twice. This had the same message recording as the above number, which confirmed 
to us we were calling the right place. 
5.38pm we call Wotif.com (1800-047 553), but after being on hold for more than 1 hour, we were at 
that point attend our pre-organised AFL game at the MCG for our first ever live AFL game, and we 
were disconnected in the elevator on the way out. On our way out of Empire Apartment Building, we mention our situation to the Concierge in the 
Lobby. The Concierge there acknowledged our situation, and advised it was quite common for that 
to happen to customers of Serviced Apartments Melbourne. He went on to say that some 
customers arrive and are unable to collect a key to gain entry as it never existed. He was confident 
that in 98% of cases it wasn’t a good outcome or experience.
We continued to call the agent and cleaner on all of their phone numbers without success; twice at 
5.55pm, and three times at 6.08pm. At this point we were feeling quite helpless and called 
Wotif.com again.
6.37pm we got through to a customer service officer at Wotif.com and after a conversation lasting 
over 45minutes where we explained the situation of the room, they offered a $50 wotif voucher and 
an apology as they were also unable to successfully contact the property Agent. It was quite 
frustrating for us as they didn’t understand how bad the situation was, and we felt like they were 
quite dismissive of our concerns and rights as their customer.
8.55pm we received a phone call from the Agent (Dan) in response to the Wotif.com request to 
contact us regarding the accommodation issues. Dan advised we had been given the correct 
apartment and after we insisted, he check the booking. Dan acknowledged that he could see we had 
indeed booked a 2bedroom 2bathroom apartment, and had been provided with a 2bedroom 
1bathroom apartment. Upon this realisation, he said he had a 2bedroom 2bathroom apartment 
available in Southbank which was 2km away from the Empire Building which was our original 
booking. We mentioned that if it was is as bad condition as the current apartment we were 
allocated not to bother, as we weren’t about to move across town to another dump of an 
apartment. The location being 2km away from the city was disappointing as we wanted the city 
immersive experience for our family. However, staying in that apartment was not an option for us.
We accepted his offer believing the new apartment would be more like what they had advertised on 
Wotif.com. In order for us to collect the keys from the bottleshop by 11pm closing, we had no other 
option but to leave the MCG prior to the end of the game, effectively cutting short our family
experience at the MCG.
We jumped in an Uber due to time constraints and were driven across town to the Empire 
Apartment to collect our bags and exchange the keys to Empire apt 1708 for the Australia 108 apt 
2118 from the bottleshop on Elizabeth Street.
10.17pm we jumped into another Uber with our family and all of our luggage and headed over to 
Australia 108 apartment 2.2km away. Upon arrival we made our way to apartment 2113. The fob 
on the keyring provided access to the elevator to level 21 where the apartment was located. We 
attempted to open the door with the key as provided, and the key wouldn’t fit in the key lock. It was 
clearly the wrong key, and there were no other keys on the keyring to try.
At this stage we are calling the Agent and anyone we can find listed on their website to gain access 
to this or any other apartment. Between 10.54pm and 11.06pm we tried to call various numbers 11 
times without success and waiting on hold to Wotif for 47 minutes before being disconnected.
At this point we went to the Lobby of the Australia 108 apartment complex and raised the challenge 
with the building concierge attendants to request their assistance in gaining access to the apartment. They refused. Their refusal was devastating to us. We offered to show them our 
booking confirmation along with photo ID to prove we were legitimate, however they refused. 
We decided to relocate from outside the apartment door as it was becoming very cold and we were 
mindful our presence in the corridor might be disturbing other residents at this time. We also 
needed to use the bathroom facilities.
Our family relocated to the Lobby with our luggage and again tried to explain the situation to the 
concierge our situation and appeal to their sympathetic side. They would not listen to us and 
advised that despite having a master key to all apartments, they would not provide us with access, 
but offered to call their locksmith at our expense.
We declined their offer at this point as we felt it was unreasonable for us to be out of pocket when 
they could simply turn a key and give us access. At this point they advise will not permit us to wait in 
their lobby, and we were to wait on the street. We refused to wait on the street as it was past 
midnight by this time, and we were now in desperate need of use of bathroom facilities which they 
had been denying us access to.
The Australia 108 apartment building is a very busy place, with visitors and residents coming and 
going frequently 24 hours a day. I was forced to suffer the humiliation of bathroom refusal and was 
very close to wetting my pants in a very public area with no where to clean myself up. I was forced 
to raise my voice and be further humiliated and demand the use of bathroom facilities before I made 
a mess on their floor. I have never been so publicly humiliated in my life. They reluctantly took 
myself and my son (one at a time) to the 11th floor PUBLIC TOILET. We later discovered we should 
have had access to this floor as it housed the amenities like pool, spa and gym. But our fob did not 
provide the required access.
It was during this bathroom visit that one of the concierge confided in me that he wanted to assist 
me but he was scared of losing his job.
We reluctantly accepted them to call their locksmith (Universal Locksmiths) after the two local 
locksmiths delayed their arrival several times and increasing the price as the morning grew nearer. 
Shortly before 1am the building locksmith arrived within about 15minutes of receiving the call, 
which at the time we assumed was due to him being on contract to the building.
We very quickly realised the locksmith was potentially a frequent visitor to this apartment as he 
quickly flipped off the coverplate on the apartment door lock, and already had the correct unique bit 
in his drill ready to go, unscrewed two screws revealing a switch which he quickly flicked with his 
finger and opened the door. It was quite obvious to us that disarming the door lock should have 
been more involved than that (husband is a carpenter by trade), and we found his offer to change 
the barrel at an additional $250 insulting when his fee was $310 already. Subsequently we 
contacted this locksmith after our return home to Canberra and we explained our situation and our 
suspicions, and he refunded $60 of his fee on 12/07/2021 off his own bat.
Having gained entry we were advised by the locksmith to be mindful not to exit the apartment with 
the door locked as we wouldn’t be able to gain entry with the wrong key which was issued to us. 
Despite assuring us we would be issued with a payment receipt at the time of payment, he reneged 
on this after we completed a bank transfer to their business account. He assured us one would be sent when his office opened in the morning, which he later honoured. Nevertheless, we were left 
feeling frustrated and upset at this ongoing situation.
Once the locksmith had left, we were left to finally inspect apartment 2113 at Australia 108. We 
were speechless. The apartment appeared to be in better condition. We soon discovered the 
following deficiencies in the apartment:
• Heating system broken (no heating or cooling)
• TV not functioning
• No power cable for wifi (or passwords)
• Large exhaust fan constantly on (only way to disable this was at the fuse box)
• Soft furnishings covered in stains etc, similar to previous apartment
• Burn marks on the table and surface tops, carpets filthy
• Springs poking out from one of the beds
• Double sized beds (not QS beds as per advertisement)
• Limited kitchen crockery (2 mugs, 1 glass, odd and chipped plates, no teaspoons, bent and 
dirty cutlery)
Despite being different to the original Empire building, this apartment (2113) was significantly 
different from the pictures Serviced Apartments Melbourne display on their website advertising 
their apartment offerings for holiday rentals.
Our first night sleep was by no means restful. It was very very cold and we were forced to sleep in 
our clothes as there were no additional blankets in the apartment. It was after 3am by the time we 
got everyone sorted into a bed. We slept for a couple of hours, but it definitely wasn’t restful sleep 
by any means.
26/06/2021 (Day 2 of 10)
8.45am Jon (my Husband) went to Southbank Police Station after finding the address of Serviced 
Apartments Melbourne head office online, and it appeared that things weren’t adding up and we 
believed we were being scammed and felt unsafe and was seeking their advice on our next course of 
action. The Police advised that it was more of a civil matter, and they were not in a position to assist 
us in any way. While we understood their reasoning, we felt completely abandoned in a foreign 
place over 600kms away from our home town of Murrumbateman NSW.
9.02am Dan calls (Agent). Jon filled Dan in on the ongoing situation. Dan questioned why we didn’t 
use their locksmith, and we said we would have if anyone had bothered to answer their phones last 
night. Dan also asked why we didn’t change the barrel at the same time, and of course we didn’t 
want to be out of pocket a further $250 at the start of our family holiday after already being down 
over $300 after the first night. Upon further discussion to resolve the key, Dan advised his locksmith 
doesn’t work weekends anyway and we would need to wait until Monday for the key situation to be 
rectified. Dan also assured us he would reimburse us immediately for the $310 incurred by the 
locksmith once we provided him with the tax invoice, which we did later that day via email. We 
point out that we are unable to leave the apartment as we can’t lock the door until Monday, 
effectively voiding the first four days of our holiday. Dan suggested we could leave the door 
unlocked while the apartment was unattended, but this suggestion was unacceptable and unsafe with a high risk of being robbed. Jon mentioned to Dan that it felt like we were in the middle of a 
scam, and he had attended the local Police Station to seek advice. Dan appeared to be quite 
agitated by this development.
9.54am – Dan calls (Agent) advising he had another apartment in the same building, however it only 
had one bathroom. As compensation, he said we could keep possession of apartment 2113 for the 
purpose of the use of the second bathroom for term of our stay. He also suggested we take the 
bedding from apartment 2113 with us to 5306 (new apartment) for our use. We now know this is 
due to the fact the next apartment also lacked any form of heating.
10.03am – Dan emailed apartment details through for the new apartment and we had to go back to 
the bottleshop to collect the keys at 1pm when it opened which was another two Uber rides.
1.40pm – Purchased 2 heaters from Big W Queen Victoria Village total cost $78.00. This was for the 
use of the bathroom in 2113. As we discovered soon after gaining entry to the 3rd apartment (5306) 
on our holiday, it also lacked any kind of heating services in the apartment (also broken). We raised 
this with Dan, and he advised he wasn’t able to get it fixed and would provide us with heaters, but 
we had already purchased them just in case. 
Other deficiencies in this apartment included:
• Heating system broken (no heating or cooling)
• TV not functioning
• No Wifi access (advertised)
• No Netflix (advertised)
• No washing machine (advertised)
• Large exhaust fan constantly on (only way to disable this was at the fuse box)
• Soft furnishings covered in stains etc, similar to previous apartment
• Limited kitchen utensils
• Dirty used face masks in utensils drawer
• Garbage stored in the bottom of the kitchen pantry cupboard
• Limited hot water available
• No access to amenities (gym, pool etc)
• No housekeeping (weekly housekeeping advertised)
27/06/2021 (Day 3 of 10 - My birthday)
We attempt to put a load of washing on in apt 5306 before heading out for a day of birthday 
activities, except we realise there is only a dryer and the washing machine is missing. Just another 
thing to add to the list of issues.
Trying to start to cheer ourselves up on this so far terrible holiday, we don’t let it get to us because 
we still have use of the other apartment (2113) and even though its two elevator rides away we can 
manage it to get the washing done. We decide to go out and try have a good day and we plan to do 
the washing later in the day, which we achieved.Being hopeful that my birthday holiday could be a positive experience from here on in….
Jon purchased a connection to try to connect the TV to the antennae. It became clear that the wall 
connection was not connected to an external antenna rendering the TV useless as it couldn’t tune in 
any channels. Without use of wifi which we had repeatedly requested the password for, we couldn’t 
even get Netflix which was also advertised as being available in the apartment.
28/06/2021 (Day 4 of 10)
10.28am – Dan calls (Agent). Dan states he is withdrawing the offer to allow us to keep both 
apartments, and we were to immediately surrender the keys for apartment 2113 to the bottleshop 
on Elizabeth Street in the CBD. We did not see this as a reasonable or acceptable solution as we 
would no longer have access to a washing machine or a second bathroom. We also refused to 
attend the bottleshop once again as it would be an additional cost to us and we had been suffering 
physically now from the additional walking into the city. We offered instead to drop the key in the 
mailbox of the apartment in the lobby which is a secure mailbox. We also offered to leave the key in 
the apartment 2113 in line with the checkout procedure. Dan advised this was not possible as there 
would be other occupants of that apartment from 2pm that day. We raised the issue again about 
the washing machine and the TV not working, and he assured us he would have that situation 
rectified immediately. We confirmed once this had been done, we were happy to return the key 
(that still didn’t fit the apartment door lock). At this point we were accused of blackmailing them 
and threatened to charge us for both rooms. We explained that all we wanted was holiday 
accommodation as they had advertised on their listing on Wotif. Dan became irate towards Jon. 
Dan also threatened we would forfeit our security deposit if we didn’t return the key. We had no 
choice but to immediately comply as demanded by Dan and started to make our way back to the 
bottleshop.
10.45am – Dan calls (Agent). Suggested leaving the key in apartment 2113 itself. Dan also advises 
that he has a fourth apartment for us to move to and would send through the confirmation and key 
collection details via email shortly. 
12.28pm – Apartment 3717 confirmation and details received via email.
1.05pm – Dan calls (Agent), advising apartment 3717 was withdrawn just as I had arrived to the 
bottleshop to collect the keys. 
1.09pm – Jon calls the bottleshop to enquire if the key was ready for collection out of curiosity. 
These guys (Dan and co-hort) seemed to be operating a bit hap-hazzardly, and our fingers were 
crossed that the fourth apartment might be more in line with the advertised apartment. If we were 
able to gain entry to an acceptable apartment, we would have happily returned all other keys and 
moved on. This is not something we are proud of attempting to do, and quite out of character for 
us, but goes to demonstrate our desperation to try and make our situation better on this so far 
nightmare holiday. Bottleshop guy initially confirmed they key was ready for collection. However, 
voices in the background can be clearly heard giving instructions to advise the key wasn’t there. Jon 
immediately called me to abort our attempt at key collection at 1.12pm. I complied. We feel the offering of another apartment was like dangling a carrot for us to placate us as by this 
stage we were quite upset and frustrated. We believe they had no intention of making good on 
their offer for a suitable apartment for us to use for the rest of our stay.
3.40pm – Jon called Mani (the cleaner) as we still had no washing. Mani advised she would contact 
Dan and provide further advise after that. Jon asked Mani if we could use the washing machine in 
2113, and she asked us not to as she had just completed a clean. Jon promised to be respectful and 
not touch anything except the washing machine and Mani agreed to this. 
Jon attended apartment 2113 and upon entry it was immediately evident that someone had been 
there and emptied the apartment of all of the furniture. The only remaining items were the beds 
sans linen, and a couple of pictures which had been removed from the wall. Jon found this to be 
quite alarming as Mani had just told him she had completed a clean of apartment 2113, and Dan had 
advised occupants would be arriving at 2pm that same day. 
Jon immediately called Dan alarmed that the apartment had been robbed, and Dan said he was 
already aware that the apartment was being emptied despite saying something to the contrary 
earlier in the day and accused us of not leaving the key. Jon advised he was no longer confident 
leaving the key in the apartment was a safe option and he didn’t want to take the risk of it going 
missing costing us our bond. Jon offered to take the key to the bottleshop, to which Dan advised Jon 
to deposit the key in the mailbox of 2113 which was our earlier suggestion that he had previously 
not agreed to. 
Jon filmed the empty apartment on his phone.
I deposited the key as requested and took photo evidence of me doing so.
29/06/2021 (Day 5 or 10)
11.21am – Dan calls (Agent) advising Mani (the cleaner) will attend to rectify all of the mentioned 
issues.
Approx 11.45am – Mani arrives with a washing machine and asks Jon to assist with shifting the dryer 
out to place it on top of the washing machine. Jon is happy to as Mani is quite a slight lady. At that 
time Jon was messaging the A Current Affair website desperate for someone to be sympathetic to 
our situation. Jon informs Mani of this and asks her to go ahead and fix the TV situation first to allow 
him to deal with A Current Affair. Shortly thereafter, Mani suddenly realises she has the incorrect 
cord for the TV, and leaves returning shortly after with a man we later know to be Michael Atwell. 
Jon questioned this man as to who he was and why he was present in the apartment. His demeaner 
was quite dismissive which was an indication to us that he was quite familiar with our situation. He 
ignored our questions and advised he was there to help with the washing machine. Jon questioned 
further where he had come from realising, he was likely to be more involved in the situation that he 
claimed to be. The man attached the TV cable but neglected to turn the TV on and check it was 
working. On realising his complacency, we figured he knew it wouldn’t fix the problem and asked 
him to check it before he left. He stated rather rudely and in a raised voice that “I don’t have time 
for this” and he left.
We were able to get a good look at Michael Atwell as he had neglected to wear a face mask inside 
the apartment. This made it very easy for us to identify him featuring in his website info-videos.
After some internet research, we have confirmed his identity as Michael Atwell. We know this to be 
correct as he owns a business called “For Sale For Lease”, which is the voice message on the 
answering service for the Serviced Apartments Melbourne. The For Sale For Lease website has a 
nice collection of videos featuring Mr Atwell promoting his business offerings. 
2.15pm – Dan calls (Agent), advising he was going to provide a full refund and we were free to find 
another apartment ourselves. Jon replied that we would accept that, conditional of the funds hitting 
our bank account whereupon we would immediately vacate the apartment. 
2.21pm – Dan called advising that the offer of a full refund wasn’t real. I feel like we had called his 
bluff and he wanted us out of the apartment with all of our money still in his pocket.
At some point during our stay in apartment 5306, we could hear an announcement being made in 
the building, but not on our speakers in the apartment. We opened the front door to the 
announcement “you can now return to the building”. Evidently, there had been a building 
evacuation and the alarms and announcements can not be heard inside apartment 5306 where we 
were occupying (no internal noise either as the TV is broken!). It should also be noted that there is 
other fire code violations throughout with no fire extinguisher or blanket available, and no 
evacuation map displayed as is required of a short-term stay apartment.
Throughout this ordeal we had already explored staying elsewhere right from day 2 of our holiday. 
The cost of moving to another apartment was prohibitive at such short notice, and we had 
exhausted a large chunk of our holiday money already with the unexpected additional expenses of a 
substantial deposit, locksmith, dozens of Ubers due to the unplanned location further from the city 
(mobility issues prevent a lot of walking). 
It just seemed to be one thing after another. Without the weekly housekeeping we were washing 
our own linen which revealed grubby quilts being used (complete with blood stains and other 
horrific unidentified stains). While removing the bed linen we revealed disguarded/opened condom 
wrappers, and a lack of cleaning in the bedroom areas. There was no broom in the apartment 
meaning we were unable to sweep the floor, and there was no dishwashing liquid or dish cloth. We 
bought our own so we were able to wash up both coffee cups and glasses so they could be 
immediately re-used by our family. The kitchen had a “junk” draw with an assortment of used face 
masks, broken electrical appliances, dirty tissues and other assorted grubby and broken implements. 
It is likely the couch has never been cleaned as there were handfuls of crumbs in between the seat 
cushions. 
We used a bed sheet from the other apartment to cover the filthy couch and chair so we could sit on 
it without stressing about the grubby mystery stains on it. There appeared to be a large food 
dehydrator in the pantry, and a printer/photocopy machine in the bedroom closet, Im unsure how 
useful either of those would be to anyone.
We have video evidence of apartment 2113 showing the state the apartment including vision of the 
screw falling out of the front door lock unassisted which is evidence of the lock being manipulated 
many more times than usual. It also shows evidence of a large build-up of dust on the exhaust fan which sucks air out of the apartment at a surprisingly high rate, except this type of outlet is 
supposed to be pushing air back into the apartment. It also shows the filthy stains and burn marks 
on the carpets and all surfaces throughout apartment 2113. It also shows a shopping bag full of dirty 
linen which is likely to have been left behind by a previous occupant who was forced to purchase 
their own clean linen. The video clearly shows the apartment is not professionally cleaned as they 
advertise on all of the websites. We are unsure if we are able to attach the video we have recorded 
to our claim, but we are more than happy to provide it immediately upon request.
5/07/2021 – (Day 10 of 10 – the last day)
From day 6 to our last day we continue to try to remain positive and make good of a nightmare 
holiday. To try to achieve this, we refrain from contacting Dan or the Agent until our scheduled 
check-out date of July 5. We attempt to call them several times on this day to ask when we can 
expect our security deposit and locksmith expense to be returned to our bank account as they had 
agreed to. They appeared to be no longer answering their phones or are possibly screening calls at 
this stage. On the fourth attempt, Dan’s assistant answers and advises Dan is busy and will call back 
shortly. Since then, on more than a dozen times, every time we call this is the same advice we 
receive. We were also asking for Michael Atwell, and were advised he was at lunch…..every time we 
called. The assistant answering phone calls (Im afraid each time I asked his name I couldn’t 
understand it), confirmed Michael Atwell to be a Director of that company.
Upon returning to Canberra on July 5, Jon was scheduled to return to work on July 6. However, he 
was compelled to take personal leave due to his level of anxiety about this whole situation. 
Subsequently, due to Jon being a frontline worker (Corrections Officer), he was advised to not attend 
his place of work for 14 days due to returning from Victoria, despite never being in a red-zone. Jon 
has used this time to recover and recuperate from this disastrous “holiday”, and it has afforded him 
time to work through claiming some of the expense back and hope for a make-up holiday at another 
time.
Jon has also sustained new injuries to both of his feet due to the literal running around on the first 
three nights trying to seek resolutions prior to closing times. These injuries are now ongoing for 
which he has sought medical treatment which will continue indefinitely until the chronic pain is 
healed.
I was due to return to work on July 7, but was forced to take a further three days off work on 
personal leave due to my mental health severely suffering due directly to this experience. I am also 
a public officer playing an integral role with maintaining the Canberra public transport network. A 
high pressure job deserving of some downtime with my family. But it just didn’t happen, and the 
impact in particular on my health and wellbeing is subject to ongoing repair.
This experience has put pressure on our family as a unit, on our marriage, and on our ability to 
perform effectively at work. The loss we have experienced from this situation is tremendous and 
ongoing. We claim the full amount up to the first threshold of $2999 in an attempt to assist with our 
healing as a family, and hopefully have an actual family holiday we can enjoy. 
*Liquorologist – a bottle shop on Elizabeth Street where one of the employees is charged to issue 
keys to customers of Serviced Apartments Melbourne (Agent) upon providing the correct key code. 
The relationship between the Liquorologist and the Agent is unknown. However, he did mention to 
us that he sees this happen all the time and almost every visitor collecting keys experiences the 
same situation we do. I believe this set-up is designed to remove the customer from any physical 
interaction with the Agent to avoid confrontation.
Through further investigations before we knew of the VCAT process to seek reimbursement, we 
undertook some detective work. What we uncovered through our internet research is the Michael 
Atwell operates under many different business names appearing to be a bit a jack-of-all trades. Our 
research also uncovered dozens of complaints dating back as far as 2017, where former customers 
tell their holiday disaster stories. It’s a shame the Agent business name isn’t provided by Wotif.com 
on their accommodation listing to allow consumers to do their own research. We incorrect through 
by going through a reputable booking agent like Wotif.com like we had many times before without 
issues, they would advocate for us if there was any kind of clear deception or misconduct taking 
place.
Michael Atwell seems to have his fingers in many pies and depending on which website you recover 
from an internet search, he provides different ABN/ACNs, names and bank account details with each 
one appearing to have its own trust account attached to it. You discover different addresses 
depending on where you look also. We believe Michael Atwell’s residential address to be 3 Vickers 
Street Hawthorne VIC (our source is related to Mr Atwell, but we will maintain their privacy for their 
own personal safety), and the ASIC website has the address listed as number 4 of the same street 
location. We believe this is to create a cloud of confusion as is common with their pattern of 
behaviour as we experienced while attempting to seek a satisfactory resolution from the Agent.
Our investigations also reveal that the level of customer service assured on all of their websites and 
voice mail messages is inconsistent and fabricated. They appear to be running a 24-hour business on 
casual hours and staff seem to be trained in providing a diversion to the customer just to get rid of 
them.

Expedia,Good riddance Expedia!!," I've booked through Expedia many times over the years and had decent service. But then again, I don't ever remember having to access their customer service. Clearly I got lucky. I'm absolutely flabbergasted at their current stance. Like many Covid travels, mine was disrupted. I was issued a credit coupon for a cancelled hotel stay. I'm now looking to rebook but they have no availability at that hotel. After several calls (and ridiculously long waits on hold), I'm told my request will be escalated and will be emailed or called back in 72 hours. Nada! Call again. Finally get through and explain the situation all over again. The hotel has a sister hotel in the same city that does have avail. via Expedia. I'm told by cust service they'll escalated the ticket again but to call the hotel directly and book/use the credit. The hotel responds and suggests that Expedia allow the use of the credit at their sister hotel (other hotel is actually closed!). The money is with Expedia and not the hotel and therefore they can't apply the credit. Call Expedia yet again and they flat out refuse to apply the credit to the sister hotel in the same city, despite having it in writing from the hotel that this would be acceptable. I can only use the credit at the specific hotel that is currently closed. Clearly Expedia is so hard up that they need my money more than I do. They'll kick a long time customer to the curb for $700! Good riddance Expedia!!

Expedia,Expedia is run by monkeys [LONG] [RANT],"As with so many other travelers, our vacation got canceled last year due to Covid. We had to cancel two days before we were to leave. After many phone calls and time spent talking on the phone over a few weeks, Expedia finally and grudgingly issued us credit for our flights. Late last year we received an email saying that travel using this credit must be completed by Dec. 31, 2021.

&#x200B;

I'm from Canada and Canada has been in travel lockdown for most of Covid. We currently are not allowed to travel, and there is no projected open date for traveling. I suspect that once the vaccination schedule is complete, Canada may open up travel. As of now, the schedule is due to finish September of 2021. This means that the earliest we could potentially travel is most likely September. So that gives us about 4 months to plan a trip that we probably don't really want to take, while competing for the limited flights with everyone else, before the credits expire. Not fun.

&#x200B;

My extended family is desperate for all of us to take a trip. My niece found a cheap cruise leaving out of Orlando for January of 2022. She booked it for her family, with nearly everyone else following suit. We decided to see if we could book flights to Orlando using our Expedia credit for the potential cruise (still a bit nervous if travel will be possible or enjoyable by then).

&#x200B;

We phoned Expedia and were on hold for a little over 3 hours before the line went dead and we were cut off. Frustrating. We called the next day, early in the morning. After waiting for 3 and a half hours, we finally got to speak with someone. We first asked if the credit could be used in January of 2022. The woman said it could. We asked her to double check. She put us on hold and came back after 10 minutes and said that she confirmed that as long as it was booked prior to Dec. 31, 2021, it was fine. We proceeded to tell her when and where we wanted to go. During our entire (lengthy) conversation, she kept cutting out repeatedly. We think her headset was wonky. We were always scared we'd be cut off and have to start over.

&#x200B;

The woman kept repeatedly making small errors in our requests. She'd be off by a day, look up Fort Lauderdale instead of Orlando, get the departure/arriving cities mixed up, constantly giving us slightly differing times for flights.... it was a struggle. Add to that, after every request or question, she'd put us on hold for 5 to 10 minutes to ""check on something"" or ""wait for the computer to process.""

&#x200B;

After going through multiple flights (most of which would suddenly no longer be available just as we wanted to book), we were finally able to book. The process up to this point took a little over 3 hours with all of her interruptions, errors, cutting out, ""canceled"" flights, etc. (Keep in mind we've been on the phone now for nearly 7 hours by now).

&#x200B;

We settle on a flight that arrives at 7:30pm, after a connection in Dallas. We, of course, must pay the difference of the flights (about $200 total), despite the fact that I can find multiple flights online with better times and prices online. We HAVE to book though Expedia on the phone to redeem our credits.

&#x200B;

The woman emails us our itinerary and we immediately check it. It's wrong. Instead of arriving at 7:30pm, we're arriving at midnight. She never mentioned anything close to that. She insists she did, but my wife and I were both on the phone talking to her and we tell her she said 7:30pm. The connection in Dallas arrives at 7:30pm. Apparently that's all she was looking at. She says that it's booked now, the money is paid and there is nothing further she can do.

&#x200B;

We tell her that we're not happy and would like to speak to her supervisor. The line goes dead. She hung up on us. We're livid. It's far too late to try calling again, I don't think we'd be able to put up with it again so quickly.

&#x200B;

About an hour later, a supervisor calls us. We initially feel relieved. We tell him what happened and he seems empathetic. We ask again if the credits can be used for the dates we want. He insists they can. We ask him to double check. He does. No problem. Over the course of half an hour, we're able to find a flight we're happy with and decide to book. He says we need to be charged an additional $200 on top of the previous charges. We try to fight the charges and explain that we've been on the phone all day and had such issues that they should just eat the additional charges. He says he can offer us a $150 credit that we can use for our hotel for all the trouble and stress we've been through. We grudgingly agree. He puts us on hold for about 10 minutes to ""finalize everything."" He comes back and says that our credit travel must be COMPLETED by Dec. 31, 2021, so we can't use it for this flight. He cancels the flight and offers us $100 in credit for our trouble and stress. Take note: That's $100 total. Not $150 that he had previously ""given"" us, he downgraded our credit after spending an hour with us on the phone (plus the previously mention 7 hours)! He ""apologizes,"" and we express our disappointment in no uncertain terms. He ""apologizes"" again, blames the airlines, and hangs up.

&#x200B;

We are disgusted by Expedia. They were of no help and wasted an entire day by not knowing their own policies of credit usage. We have no idea if we're going to be able to use our credit at all. We are constrained by government regulations and Expedia's misrepresentation of their own unscrupulous policies.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Spent 8 hours talking to Expedia to redeem Expedia credit. Expedia representative makes constant mistakes, books wrong time for the flight. Supervisor tells us our credits can't be used for what he originally said we could book and cancels our flight. A waste of an entire day.

&#x200B;

Edit/Update: We have finally received a refund for our flights. We have been in constant contact with both Expedia and American Airlines. This was much more work and stress than it should have been. I will never fly American Airlines again if I can help it. They will certainly not get any of my money directly.

At least the American Airlines agents treated us with respect and tried to help us. Expedia did the exact opposite. They blocked us at every opportunity. I will never use Expedia or any of their subsidiaries (Travelocity, Orbitz, [Hotels.com](https://Hotels.com), Vrbo, Hotwire, CheapTickets, HomeAway, Trivago, etc.) ever again.

Please be more aware of the way these business treat their customers. They feel that you NEED them. You don't. The extra work you may have to do is worth it.",13,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/m4hbd2/expedia_is_run_by_monkeys_long_rant/,2021-03-13 22:37:09,Booking.com
Expedia,"Booked in Expedia, American Airlines Refund!","TLDR: I called AA and they gave me a website, I'll need to wait for my refund but it's possible!

CONTEXT! So I'm in Tegucigalpa (Honduras) and booked a flight to London (to go on the 1 of April and return on the 20) when my country started the lockdown I called the airline to get some information, they told me I can change my flight without penalty except for the difference of the price on my new ticket OR I can wait until 5 days before my flight to call again, because the airline needs to be sure than the flight is going to be cancel.

It got cancel! Then I received an email of Expedia saying ""We gave you a credit with this airline!"" So like the voucher. Today I called at night (the Honduran number) and asked about the credit, they told than yes I can saved it for future travels (but I'll guess only for 12 months after my initial flight) OR I CAN GET MY REFUND! because the flight was cancelled!

She told me to go to [prefunds.aa.com](https://prefunds.aa.com/refunds/) and put my ticket's number, full the format and wait for 5-7 days.

Apparently, they'll give me an answer, then I could get my refund between 5-7 or 2 months, depends of my bank.

I'll give an update! Also I have another flight in June so I'll check how can I get a solution for that!

Expedia,"18 months later, 9 calls (to Expedia) 5 calls to the Airline, 3 emails, 5 hour wait times on hold, and still no refund. AVOID EXPEDIA AT ALL COSTS."," United Airlines (booked through Expedia) unilaterally cancelled my flight (LAX - Melbourne) in March of 2020 when 'rona hit, and did not offer a replacement flight.

I'm accordingly entitled to a full refund. Not a voucher; a full refund.

I attempted to submit a claim on United's website. It was declined. I rang United and they told me this was because it was booked via Expedia so they have to process it as they booked it.

Each time I call Expedia, I wait several hours (most recent call was a **5 hour** hold time, I kid you not) before speaking to a representative in some offshore call center, who (after half an hour of back and forth) always assures me it's been done, and 'can take up to 12 weeks to process.' 

Cue me checking bank details for 3 months for nothing, followed by calling again, sitting on hold for several hours for the exact same response (it's been done, wait 12 weeks).

When I call United, they tell me nothing has been done 'on their system' and they're still waiting for contact from Expedia, and I need to go through Expedia.

This has been happening like clockwork now every 2-3 or so months.

I'm now up to 9 calls to Expedia alone, and 5 to the Airline over 16 months, emails and calls assuring me it's been done, and it never actually is. My most recent Email was this:



>“Subject: Your cancellation confirmation for your Expedia   itinerary 752624\*\*\*\* Hello \*\*\*\*\*, Thank you for contacting Expedia.I've   gone ahead and canceled your flight and you'll receive a refund as   follows:Refund date: May 05, 2021Current ticket value: AUD 1,257.30 per   travelerCancellation fee: AUD 0.00 per travelerRefund amount: AUD 1,257.30   per travelerTotal refund amount: {currency} {total amount}Card used: Visa   ending in ,\*\*\*\*\* expiring \*\*\*\*\* Since the refund is coming from United   Airlines and not Expedia, you can reach out to them directly if you have any   refund questions.It can take up to 12 weeks for the funds to show up in your   account, depending on the airline and your bank.Thanks for choosing Expedia.”

After waiting the 12 weeks, I reached out to the Airline, who again told me 'it doesnt appear on their system and they cant do anything unless it comes from Expedia'.

I again contacted Expedia (3 hours hold time) and this time demanded a three way call (me, them and United) which while they obliged, Expedia didnt let me actually listen to (again - after another hour on hold). 

After the Expedia rep spoke to United, I was again assured by Expedia it had been done. Only 15 days to wait this time. It felt like some progress had been made.

Then today, I get this from United:

&#x200B;

>Thank you for contacting United Refunds.  
>  
>We would like to advise you of the following:  
>  
>Our records indicate the above referenced ticket was not issued via United Airlines. In accordance with our refund policy, also published on United.com, kindly submit your request to your Travel Agent.  
>  
>Thank you for choosing United Airlines. We look forward to serving you again soon.

 Calling the airline is a waste of time, as they tell me they will only speak to to Expedia, and the Expedia call center just keep fobbing me off as well, and failing to identify that there is a problem and getting it sorted.

Expedia and the airlines are using our money as a piggy bank to get them through COVID and it's disgusting.

Im based in Australia and this is driving me nuts. Does anyone have any suggestions for how to get my money back?

interestingly their annual report to shareholders state their refund practices (good info for class action lawyers): ""  Our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply, occupancy and ADRs, decreases in airline capacity, periodically rising airline ticket prices, or the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, all of which we have experienced historically. Other factors that could negatively affect our business include:

* Significant changes in oil prices;
* Continued air carrier and hotel chain consolidation;
* Reduced access to discount airfares;
* ....
* Health-related risks, such as the Ebola, H1N1, SARs and avian flu outbreaks.

Such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services. This decrease in demand, depending on its scope and duration, together with any future issues affecting travel safety, could significantly and adversely affect our business, working capital and financial performance over the short and long-term. In addition, the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events, such as severe weather conditions, actual or threatened terrorist activity or war, could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity if we, as we have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions, provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets, hotel reservations and other travel products and services""",21,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/fknqo4/how_to_boycott_expedia_aka_screw_expedia_book/,2020-03-18 11:00:32,Booking.com

My name is Ezra Hangadi and my email address is [uziezrah@gmail.com](mailto:uziezrah@gmail.com), my itinerary number is 7551010299081

I attempted to cancel my flight numerous ways yesterday a few hours after booking, but was not successful.

I tried cancelling through your website and I also tried calling and was put on hold for almost 50 minutes and then hung up on.  Your agent said she was having issues cancelling on her end and would have to contact Ukranian Airlines.  She put me on hold for almost 50 minutes and then mysteriously hung up.

Please refund my money as promised if I attempted to cancel under 24 hours.  Attached is a screenshot showing proof of my attempt to cancel through your website.  I have two screenshot one of which was yesterday a few hours after my booking and second one is from today chatting with your agent who promised me a refund

Expedia,Successfully got my refund from AA,"I booked a round trip that contains two different airlines (American Airlines & Alaska Airlines) on January 27th through Expedia. The flights was on March 18th and March 29th. The March 18th one is American Airlines and had a layover in LAX which made me decided to cancel it due to the coronavirus situation in CA. I then booked another direct flight from Alaska Airlines for that day.

On the day of March 18th, I got a text alert for flight status that I signed up before for the American Airlines flight (that I cancelled) saying that American Airlines had cancelled the flight. I was kinda upset that they did that after I cancelled it because I thought I would not get a refund, only travel credit.

A couple days ago, I saw someone posted the [refund request page ](https://prefunds.aa.com/refunds/)on American Airlines which you just put in your ticket number and last name and they will check if you are eligible for a refund. I put in mine and turned out I am eligible because they cancelled the flight. So I submitted the request and waited for it to be reviewed.

Although I have been seeing “if you booked through a third party website, please contact them for refund,” I actually got the refund back to my credit card today without contacting Expedia.

Sorry if there’s any grammar error, English is my second language. Hopefully this will help anyone that has a similar situation with me!",7,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/ft3xhl/successfully_got_my_refund_from_aa/,2020-04-01 17:15:35,Booking.com
Expedia,I am so frustrated with this terrible company. Have they lied to anyone else?!,"I booked a quick hotel stay to go down to Disney for a few days, as a little quick spring break trip with the kids and boyfriend in early March 2020. I booked ahead of time and was aware that I booked a room that didn’t have free cancellation. (As we didn’t plan on canceling, as we couldn’t have known how bad COVID-19 was going to be.) I paid a deposit, which amounted to about $200 and counted as one of the nights we would be staying there. It wasn’t a big deal. Then the 10th of March passed which was the last day you could cancel for deposit refund. A few short days later, the news broke out about the closing of Disney World. My kids were devastated and being a frugal mom, the first thing I thought of was the hotel reservation. As we were leaving in the morning and packed to leave. We had been getting a few things for the drive, and I rushed home to reach customer service. The phone line was completely busy. I would either get the busy tone or told there was an incredibly long wait, then the last time I called it was automated and told me to go online for any cancellations. I assumed because of the virus, they had set it up to cancel online to help people out. Wasn’t sure what would happen then. Couldn’t really take getting hit with the full amount of the stay the next day when we didn’t check in. Then I noticed that I didn’t get any communication or email about my deposit. I was thinking because of the circumstances, they would be willing to help customers out. Nope. It took me months to finally reach someone, I gave up trying to navigate long hold times dealing with two small homebound children. The chat was always busy and it told me to try again later. I even tried to reach the hotel, whom were closed for a period of time. With no luck. When I reached someone in chat in May, she told me she would reach out to the hotel personally while we were chatting. She was never able to reach them but told me customer care would be helping me out and getting me my refund. Customer care sent me the message in the first photo, two days later after what I had assumed it as them talking to the hotel, informing me that the refund was being processed and I would receive in 30 days. When well past 30 days had passed, I had scanned my account for the refund. I had tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, because I knew they must be busy but I saw nothing. Confused, I reached back out to ask them about where the refund was and was sent the same generic response as the last photo. That response was sent, after I had informed them that they had lied about my refund being on the way and were now telling me I wasn’t getting one. It might not be a lot of money to some, but I’m still navigating being jobless in Florida. With numbers rising and no jobs in my career field. It would be nice to have that money back as I was told I would. Do I have any rights in this? Should I speak to a lawyer? File complaint with FTC and/or dispute with my bank? I mean this is just ridiculous to me. It makes me really mad, because chances are if they were quick to do this to me..they have probably done it to others. Any help is appreciated, thank you!

Expedia,Expedia is run by monkeys [LONG] [RANT],"As with so many other travelers, our vacation got canceled last year due to Covid. We had to cancel two days before we were to leave. After many phone calls and time spent talking on the phone over a few weeks, Expedia finally and grudgingly issued us credit for our flights. Late last year we received an email saying that travel using this credit must be completed by Dec. 31, 2021.

&#x200B;

I'm from Canada and Canada has been in travel lockdown for most of Covid. We currently are not allowed to travel, and there is no projected open date for traveling. I suspect that once the vaccination schedule is complete, Canada may open up travel. As of now, the schedule is due to finish September of 2021. This means that the earliest we could potentially travel is most likely September. So that gives us about 4 months to plan a trip that we probably don't really want to take, while competing for the limited flights with everyone else, before the credits expire. Not fun.

&#x200B;

My extended family is desperate for all of us to take a trip. My niece found a cheap cruise leaving out of Orlando for January of 2022. She booked it for her family, with nearly everyone else following suit. We decided to see if we could book flights to Orlando using our Expedia credit for the potential cruise (still a bit nervous if travel will be possible or enjoyable by then).

&#x200B;

We phoned Expedia and were on hold for a little over 3 hours before the line went dead and we were cut off. Frustrating. We called the next day, early in the morning. After waiting for 3 and a half hours, we finally got to speak with someone. We first asked if the credit could be used in January of 2022. The woman said it could. We asked her to double check. She put us on hold and came back after 10 minutes and said that she confirmed that as long as it was booked prior to Dec. 31, 2021, it was fine. We proceeded to tell her when and where we wanted to go. During our entire (lengthy) conversation, she kept cutting out repeatedly. We think her headset was wonky. We were always scared we'd be cut off and have to start over.

&#x200B;

The woman kept repeatedly making small errors in our requests. She'd be off by a day, look up Fort Lauderdale instead of Orlando, get the departure/arriving cities mixed up, constantly giving us slightly differing times for flights.... it was a struggle. Add to that, after every request or question, she'd put us on hold for 5 to 10 minutes to ""check on something"" or ""wait for the computer to process.""

&#x200B;

After going through multiple flights (most of which would suddenly no longer be available just as we wanted to book), we were finally able to book. The process up to this point took a little over 3 hours with all of her interruptions, errors, cutting out, ""canceled"" flights, etc. (Keep in mind we've been on the phone now for nearly 7 hours by now).

&#x200B;

We settle on a flight that arrives at 7:30pm, after a connection in Dallas. We, of course, must pay the difference of the flights (about $200 total), despite the fact that I can find multiple flights online with better times and prices online. We HAVE to book though Expedia on the phone to redeem our credits.

&#x200B;

The woman emails us our itinerary and we immediately check it. It's wrong. Instead of arriving at 7:30pm, we're arriving at midnight. She never mentioned anything close to that. She insists she did, but my wife and I were both on the phone talking to her and we tell her she said 7:30pm. The connection in Dallas arrives at 7:30pm. Apparently that's all she was looking at. She says that it's booked now, the money is paid and there is nothing further she can do.

&#x200B;

We tell her that we're not happy and would like to speak to her supervisor. The line goes dead. She hung up on us. We're livid. It's far too late to try calling again, I don't think we'd be able to put up with it again so quickly.

&#x200B;

About an hour later, a supervisor calls us. We initially feel relieved. We tell him what happened and he seems empathetic. We ask again if the credits can be used for the dates we want. He insists they can. We ask him to double check. He does. No problem. Over the course of half an hour, we're able to find a flight we're happy with and decide to book. He says we need to be charged an additional $200 on top of the previous charges. We try to fight the charges and explain that we've been on the phone all day and had such issues that they should just eat the additional charges. He says he can offer us a $150 credit that we can use for our hotel for all the trouble and stress we've been through. We grudgingly agree. He puts us on hold for about 10 minutes to ""finalize everything."" He comes back and says that our credit travel must be COMPLETED by Dec. 31, 2021, so we can't use it for this flight. He cancels the flight and offers us $100 in credit for our trouble and stress. Take note: That's $100 total. Not $150 that he had previously ""given"" us, he downgraded our credit after spending an hour with us on the phone (plus the previously mention 7 hours)! He ""apologizes,"" and we express our disappointment in no uncertain terms. He ""apologizes"" again, blames the airlines, and hangs up.

&#x200B;

We are disgusted by Expedia. They were of no help and wasted an entire day by not knowing their own policies of credit usage. We have no idea if we're going to be able to use our credit at all. We are constrained by government regulations and Expedia's misrepresentation of their own unscrupulous policies.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Spent 8 hours talking to Expedia to redeem Expedia credit. Expedia representative makes constant mistakes, books wrong time for the flight. Supervisor tells us our credits can't be used for what he originally said we could book and cancels our flight. A waste of an entire day.

&#x200B;

Edit/Update: We have finally received a refund for our flights. We have been in constant contact with both Expedia and American Airlines. This was much more work and stress than it should have been. I will never fly American Airlines again if I can help it. They will certainly not get any of my money directly.

At least the American Airlines agents treated us with respect and tried to help us. Expedia did the exact opposite. They blocked us at every opportunity. I will never use Expedia or any of their subsidiaries (Travelocity, Orbitz, [Hotels.com](https://Hotels.com), Vrbo, Hotwire, CheapTickets, HomeAway, Trivago, etc.) ever again.

Expedia,Holidays with the devil,"So, this is my story. I made a booking with Expedia, that gets booked through VRBO. Destination, Sierra Nevada for skiing.

Two days before the trip, the non refundable reservation gets cancelled, so I'm left with planned and paid holidays but no room.

I contact Expedia and get sent to VRBO, after being thrown around from department to department, I'm told by an employee that they can only relocate Expedia reservation, and for people who get stranded, and since I haven't gone to the destination yet, I'm not stranded....yet.

So, the employee also tells me that even though I've made a reservation with Expedia it can be booked through VRBO, and be given VRBO support because they are all the same company but that because my reservation is VRBO it doesn't have relocation right....makes sense? Not to me.

In summary, Expedia allowed a cancellation of a Non Refundable, and it is letting time pass to find options ONLY when I get stranded tomorrow...

interestingly their annual report to shareholders state their refund practices (good info for class action lawyers): ""  Our business is also sensitive to fluctuations in hotel supply, occupancy and ADRs, decreases in airline capacity, periodically rising airline ticket prices, or the imposition of taxes or surcharges by regulatory authorities, all of which we have experienced historically. Other factors that could negatively affect our business include:

* Significant changes in oil prices;
* Continued air carrier and hotel chain consolidation;
* Reduced access to discount airfares;
* ....
* Health-related risks, such as the Ebola, H1N1, SARs and avian flu outbreaks.

Such concerns could result in a protracted decrease in demand for our travel services. This decrease in demand, depending on its scope and duration, together with any future issues affecting travel safety, could significantly and adversely affect our business, working capital and financial performance over the short and long-term. In addition, the disruption of the existing travel plans of a significant number of travelers upon the occurrence of certain events, such as severe weather conditions, actual or threatened terrorist activity or war, could result in the incurrence of significant additional costs and decrease our revenues leading to constrained liquidity if we, as we have done historically in the case of severe weather conditions, provide relief to affected travelers by refunding the price or fees associated with airline tickets, hotel reservations and other travel products and services""",20,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/fknqo4/how_to_boycott_expedia_aka_screw_expedia_book/,2020-03-18 11:00:32,Vrbo
Airbnb,Expedia? Booking.com? Any advice on if it's worth adding other channels?,"I currently list my STR properties on Airbnb and VRBO.  

The Airbnb guests are generally very good, especially since Airbnb started working to eliminate party-guests.  VRBO guests are decent, but tend to be a little more high-maintenance and act like they're staying at a hotel.  I assume the difference has to do with the demographic and also that guest reviews are a bigger part of the Airbnb ecosystem (bad reviews from hosts actually mean something on Airbnb). 

Has anyone had luck with other channels besides Airbnb and VRBO?  Looking for channels that can generate enough volume to be worth the integration effort, and also have decent and considerate guests.  I tried [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) a couple years ago and the guests were so bad, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.  They mostly trashed my houses and the payments would fail all the time.  Also, their website is such a complicated mess that it's borderline impossible to figure out what they're doing (for example, they required me to login and manually pay invoices on each property separately so they could get their commissions, wtf).  I'll never use them again.

Anyone having luck with channels other that Airbnb and VRBO?   My properties are in North Carolina - Charlotte and Asheville.

Airbnb,Review Pulled by Airbnb for Vague and Unacceptable Reasons,"I had a stay in France recently which I wrote up in this sub where I described arriving to a property in Le Pecq, France which had recent and highly visible crowbar damage to the 1st floor terrace doors from am attempted break in, an obvious safety risk. There were visible chunks of wood hacked out of the doors. The co-host who met me confirmed this. 

I wrote an honest and factual (not personal) review that described everything. Received notification that Airbnb today that they removed the review because it 'wasn't helpful to the community' (hard to imagine). 

When I questioned Airbnb they said they removed it because the damage didn't happen during my stay, although obviously is a safety risk regardless. I responded by telling them that there are so many reviews of properties that people walk into everyday with multitudes of problems (odors from cat pee, bedbugs, torn up furniture) and asked if those reviews are deleted too because it didn't happen during their stay. 

Conclusion: they don't care about safety as much as you think they would and go to any expense to protect hosts. 

Result: I'm a 10 year heavy user, guest and host and I'm closing my account. Note: they make that as hard as possible. I see options for deactivation but not closing.

Airbnb,Sketchy “New” Listing [USA] photos all over internet ,"Ok so back in like November last year my mom books this Airbnb for my family for our Disney vacation without asking anyone and we’re all nervous bc it’s a new listing with no reviews and they have her a good deal apparently. I am a travel consultant and I do NOT book anything without reviews. We’re not happy but my mom is hellbent on this place (not even that nice compared to other properties we were looking at but whatever) We all let it go bc she said she’s sure there’ll be more reviews later. 

Fast forward, we’re booking Airbnb for another trip (Disney is in a few weeks) and husband notices that the Airbnb still has only 1 vague review. So we start investigating and here’s what we find. 

1. Host has 29 properties all in the same area. Some with like a few reviews but most are vague and look iffy. 

2. Host has no profile picture. 

3. Reverse image search and find the Zillow listing with EXACT same pictures. 

4. Also find the same pics on a weird Instagram account with pics that are all liked by clear bots

5. Find the listing on Expedia too from 2019 with one, one word review, exact same pics. So not a “new” property?? 

6. Find the owner on public record, it’s a vacation rental company but I cannot tie the “host” to the company in any way and the Instagram account that has the photos is also not affiliated with the company. “Photo formatting” don’t align with the company’s marketing on their website 

It’s all just super weird that this property is EVERYWHERE on the internet, pics are exactly like the Zillow listing (either stolen pics, no recent pics of property, or they just kept it the same as when it was on Zillow????) 

Host just doesn’t look like a real person like other Airbnb hosts. Looked up the person (very specific name) and could only find a lawyer in NY with her name. Highly doubt she manages properties for this vacation rental company. 

It all just seems weird, inconsistent, and there’s just too many red flags. I’ve decided we’re going to rebook but I’m not excited to confront my mom with my findings bc it’s all in her name so I’ll need to convince her to cancel. I just would rather not go into this with any doubts. Thoughts anyone?

I reached out to them and said I’ve got to cancel due to everything going on.  I cancelled both.  I then saw I wasn’t going to get a refund.  I looked and saw that Airbnb is not giving full refunds past a 4/14 date.  I reached out to the hosts explaining that the US put a travel advisory to Europe and I was flying into Prague and driving into Germany but now the border is closed.  Both hosts said they wouldn’t refund me the money.  I then messaged them and said that I understood that Airbnb was still going to charge them the money for the reservation so could they just refund me the difference?  Both said no.

Airbnb,Help! “Wandercamp Olympic” glamping scam? [USA],"
Hi all, so I am still shocked and confused about an Airbnb experience last night. The experience is kind of long but I would appreciate any advice on how to get a refund or any advice on how to proceed. 

 A friend and I booked a “glamping” Airbnb near Port Angeles, Washington. The listing showed photos of tents in a field with picnic tables and fire pits. They showed well decorated tents with lounge chairs and pillows. But most importantly, the tents were in a nice open field. Yesterday, we drive 3 hours to the location and were hoping to check in at 5, but the hosts messaged us and said we can’t check in until 7 because they have heavy machinery operating in the area, which was confusing. But we hang out in town and then head over to the site. My partner and I meet our friend there and to our surprise, we are deep in a forest, on a dirt road loop that had just been dug and tents that were just erected that day. The guy who tells us where to park is acting aloof, like he doesn’t know what is going on either, and says he will reach out to the Airbnb hosts when we confront him about not being in the right location. The site is a complete mess. There are no fire pits (as advertised in photos as well as the amenities section), which was very upsetting because I brought sausages to cook as my dinner. So the guy (I never did catch his name) pulls out a brand new fire pit from his truck and sets it up in the forest on uneven ground under the trees. He also said that this was their first day open. However, the listing we thought we booked has reviews dating back years. At this point it’s past 8pm and we are too far from home to go back and we can’t afford a hotel so we decide to stay that night but we are realizing we have been scammed. This location we are at is not the photos we were advertised. We start messaging the host and don’t get a response, we call and message Airbnb and they are taking a long time to get back to us. Finally, at 10 pm, the host replies asking what is wrong with our site. It seems like the host is using AI or something to answer my messages because none of it is making sense and they are not answering our questions about why the site is different than advertised. We go to bed and have worst sleep ever. The beds are not level and we are rolling around all night. Additionally, the bathrooms didn’t have hot water as advertised and the walkways around the tents had just been cut so there are tripping hazards everywhere, causing my friend’s toddler to trip a lot. The airbnb seems to be owned by a company, Wandercamp, with multiple locations around the US. The weird thing is that on Wandercamp’s website, they list a totally different address for their Olympic location, and even on the original Airbnb listing they list the other address, but the hosts specifically sent us this new address in the forest.

Overall, I am so confused as to what happened. Apparently this site has been verified, but it is literally in a different location than advertised. Airbnb got back to me at 2 am saying they can do a partial refund of $22. I paid over $130. It just seems ridiculous. How can a host get away with this? What can I do about this? 

Thanks for reading and for any advice / insight.

Airbnb,Outside fees not disclosed in price breakdown [USA],"I stayed at a hotel and they demanded a $25 ""destination fee"" as well as a $125 incidental deposit during check-in. My understanding is that both of these transactions are permissible if they are disclosed in the listing AND the price breakdown. [Source](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2827). They were in the listing, but not the breakdown.   


I have chatted and spoken with several Airbnb support people and all of them have given me very confusing replies and they don't think there is a problem.   


For example:  
*""The article which you have shared with me, It's for collecting fees outside Airbnb so all this fees will never disclose in your price break down because all these fees are totally depends on Host, and it may collect by third party application which means outside Airbnb which is not visible in your price break down.""*   


This contradicts with their [own policy](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2827). I don't seem to be getting through to them and I was wondering if you guys have any advice on **how to escalate this** to someone at Airbnb that can understand and take action.   


RANT: I depend on the price breakdown for pricing transparency which also affects searching for listings by price. I understand that info buried in the listing details, but I didn't read the entire listing. I was in a last-minute rush and willing to take a risk on the listing details because I have an expectation for the range of potential things that would be in the listing details and money is not and should not be one of them. This hotel is posting rates that are artificially depressed. One of the main reasons I use AirBnB is because of the pricing transparency and handling of fees within the platform. An example of what I'm avoiding: Expedia listing rooms for $100 and when you get to pay it's all of a sudden $350 with various fees. At least Expedia shows the fees in the final total. With AirBnB I expect to be able to **search and book with total fees calculated before taxes**.  This is what my experience has been in over 35 bookings in the past 5 years. Not this one.

Airbnb,"Need advice if an airbnb listing in cabo is a scam, it looks like a scam but i wanted to get some feedback [Cabo, MX]","I've stayed at a few airbnbs in the past. looking into Cabo Mexico for next year and came across this one airbnb listing that offers a significant discount on a two bedroom suite in a hotel.

Now checking the price on Expedia for example it comes up to over $6K while that listing on airbnb for the same room (same pictures) is just under $3K for the same dates.

This listing has no reviews (maybe new?) but the host has other listings with reviews. i thought its impossible to fake reviews since only guests can review hosts.

the website seems extremely fishy and the address on the website is a USPS office in IL (probably a PO Box).

Airbnb,Disappointed by Tacky AirBnB OMG Fund Winners,"This might have already been discussed, but it's been bothering me for a few months. Many of the [AirBnB OMG Fund Winners](https://news.airbnb.com/100-out-of-this-world-ideas-meet-the-recipients-of-the-10m-omg-fund/) are very disappointing. A lot are very tacky, kitsch, and the architecture is not tasteful or respectful to their surroundings. 

Are these the types of AirBnB's we want? I understand it's *an* experience...but do we want the experience to be akin to [tacky tourist-trap motels](https://mediaim.expedia.com/destination/2/74d4c527182ed84efe04b16f868a9908.jpg) with cheap resin sculptures?

No disrespect to any of the winners - and there are winners that have very tasteful designs too. They all followed the rules and won by what AirBnB wanted. This is just an opinion from someone with a background in architecture, real estate, and urbanism. I'm just very disappointed that this is the type of construction/architecture AirBnB is promoting with **large sums of money** rather than designs that complement our surroundings and are not at risk of becoming abandoned or demolished within a few decades as fads and tastes change.

As we get closer to the travel date (and the cutoff date to cancel with refund) I am getting nervous with some details. Firstly, the Expedia page for the property says the property is unavailable for the next year. The AirBnB listing also no longer shows availability for any date. 

The host page shows a number of listings, none of which are for my booking. They only have two reviews, one of which is “Total scam!! Property did not exist.” 

Am I about to arrive in NYC and fall victim to a fake hotel listing? If so I want to cancel while I still can.

Airbnb,"Non-Responsive Host, AirBNB Says Tough Luck","We are moving across the country and intend on staying in an airbnb until we find a rental in 'new' town.  I booked a mother-in-law suite the first week of March for a 5 week stay starting the first week of July. 3 reasons - to get a better price, to ensure we wouldn't have to be constantly moving, and just we would have somewhere to stay as this town is relatively small.  I got weird vibes from some of the hosts responses to reviews, but shrugged it off as just an older person.  I sent a message immediately after booking (it auto confirmed) which didn't really necessitate a response, but thought I would get one. Never did.

I looked at the listing again last weekend to check, and the last review says they were unable to checkin as the host never responded or provided details. Worrying.  I also see that there is no  availability for this rental either on AirBNB, VRBO, or Expedia.

I sent the host a message through the app Monday morning, called (straight to VM) on Wednesday and left a voicemail, and sent a text on Thursday.  I have not gotten a response to any of these.  Did some research and it is pretty clear that the original host has died and his son is now managing the listing.  But based on reviews, people have stayed there since the original host died last fall so idk.

&#x200B;

I contacted airbnb and they've just said sorry we can't do anything unless the host hasn't responded 72 hours before the listing - which is over a month away.  Clearly they won't respond, and I would think AirBNB would take into account that the last person booked was unable to checkin right?  We were able to get this rental for about 1800 for the 5 weeks.  Pretty much everywhere I saved when I was looking is booked now, and what is left is about 5000 for 5 weeks.  We have a pet and need reliable internet to WFH until we find a place to live.  Anything I can do here?

EDIT: Called support back and got the same response of nothing to do until 3 days before.  About an hour later they called back and said they would be cancelling on the hosts behalf.  So someone along the chain read my message about the host passing away I think. Not the best resolution as now we have to pay much  more than if we'd been able to successfully book 2.5 months ago, but at least not scrambling last minute.",10,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/v06s9w/nonresponsive_host_airbnb_says_tough_luck/,2022-05-29 08:25:18,Expedia

Airbnb,"Guest shopping and noticed prices near, or over 5 star hotel prices. Why?","Hi everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster, and I have a question regarding prices. 

My wife and I use airBnB from time to time when we travel. Our experiences have been great and we have a great rating as well.  

Our main justification is that it usually saves us a lot of money over a hotel, especially in an area that has uber readily available, which allows us to stay a bit further out, and take an inexpensive ride to the area we want. 

Our next trip is in 3 months and I was looking at airBnB locations for about 2 hours yestersay. I was a little shocked at the prices. In our case, we like to explore, so as a result, we are not at the host location much, minus to shower and sleep. Our needs are limited as a result - single room, 2 adults no kids, comfy bed, safe neighborhood, clean bathroom, good host rating. After that, I tend not to care about amenities. 

After spending 2 hours not finding anything that jumped out at me as a fair deal, I went on expedia. I ASSUMED airBnB would be by far our cheapest option, especially for Memorial Day weekend. I was shocked to find hotel after hotel with 4.5 plus ratings for cheaper than one bedroom listings, closer to where we wanted to be to begin with. 

This is the first time I have ever seen this. 

Can anyone provide why that is? As much as we have liked our airBnB experiences, on this one I almost feel compelled to go with a hotel. I expected to save $100+ a night, but after looking, the average savings was $30, or in some cases, nothing. 

I was curious from the host standpoint why this may be.

Airbnb,The odd couple.,"I am finishing up hosting and have 3 reservations left. Yesterday morning two people banged my door down at 7.45am, check in starts at 3.00pm. So himself went downstairs to hold their luggage and explain they are 7 hours too early. He gives them a key to come back at 3.

9.00am they return go into our sitting room, switch on the TV and start eating food. Hubby goes back down and tells them they are 6 hours early. Eventually they leave.

The female is about 20 ish and asks for another room as her friend in his 60' s just booked one. We obliged and advised they needed to pay extra. She said that was ok. About 11.00pm they return home both drunk, her top is open and she makes her way upstairs.

They stayed in all day and he keeps going out to the shop and returning with food bags and goes up to the double room. He must have left about 10 times while we were home. She came out of the room once and my 10 yr said why is that womans bum not covered. Had to explain she was probably too warm.

 They have a large bathroom but one of them left poo on the seat which am not cleaning so caught her trying to use the family one. She just smiled and said sorry. I just said no problem you obviously missed the massive private sign on the door. So the poo is still on the seat. 

They are here for 8 days, they are  just friends, he booked the holiday and was probably hoping that if in one room , a relationship will develop. But he is in her room all the time except for sleep. 

They are an odd couple. He just blanks the kids  most guests say hello, he just walks past them all.

Airbnb,Here is Homeaway’s Policy,"Dear Host,
In HomeAway's nearly 25 years, we’ve been through a lot, but nothing comes close to the current challenges facing our holidaymakers, partners, and team members around the world. 

HomeAway is a two-sided marketplace, so for every holidaymaker who paid hard-earned money for a getaway they may not take, there is a partner who is experiencing a loss of bookings and a large number of cancellations. Despite this, the vast majority of you are rising to the occasion and giving credits and/or refunds to holidaymakers in these extreme circumstances. Thank you for exemplifying hospitality — even when it means a financial hardship. 

Today, we are introducing our COVID-19 Emergency Policy, a series of measures designed to help navigate these extraordinary circumstances. 

For our part, HomeAway is refunding 100% of the money it makes through traveller service fees when someone must cancel a trip due to COVID-19. 

For your part, we ask that you handle cancellations for trips booked before March 13 with stays that fall between March 13 and April 30 in one of two ways (even if those trips are outside of your set cancellation policy): 

Option 1 (Default): Offer a credit for full value and flexible stay dates within the next year (at no additional cost) to holidaymakers who can’t take trips now due to COVID-19. 

Option 2: If a holidaymaker is unwilling to accept a credit, we advise you to issue them a refund. If you are unable to accommodate a full refund, HomeAway expects you to provide at least a 50% refund if the holidaymaker cancels during this time. 

Our intent is to reward HomeAway partners who offer holidaymakers flexibility during this time of uncertainty with additional visibility in holidaymaker searches on HomeAway and Expedia Group. The idea is that the more you do now for holidaymakers, the more we will reward you moving forward (so a 100% credit/refund will count more than 50% refund and so on). 

Here’s more on what HomeAway is doing as part of our COVID-19 Emergency Policy: 

Full Refund of HomeAway’s Fees: HomeAway is refunding 100% of the money it makes through traveller service fees when someone must cancel a trip due to COVID-19, whether the cancellation is government-mandated or not. This goes into effect for all stays booked before March 13 with a night between 13th March and 30th April. Holidaymakers don’t have to do anything to collect the refund; it will happen automatically over the next few weeks. They do not need to call and confirm. 

Rolling Out Automated Refunds: Our teams are also working to make refunds and date changes to bookings easier for you. Details on this new process will be communicated in the coming days, so we ask that you wait to call our Customer Service line until that happens. We acknowledge that credits for future dates will be administered between our partners and holidaymakers, so we only ask that your teams acknowledge the arrangement in writing — ideally via our secure messaging system. 

Automatically Waiving Related Cancellation Penalties: If you need to cancel due to this event, we will automatically waive the cancellation so it does not impact your ranking metrics. You no longer have to call Customer Service to get the cancellation waived, just select COVID-19 as the cancellation reason code and refund at the minimum 50% to be eligible. 

The new policy we are implementing is not perfect, but in this unprecedented time we believe it strikes the best balance of protecting holidaymakers, partners, and the public. I am sure many of you have questions. We primarily want you to understand the spirit of how we hope to address this situation. Please review our help portal and Discovery Hub for the most up-to-date information. These resources will be updated every 48 hours with new information. 

We have been in contact with thousands of you in the past days and I am humbled by your willingness to rise to the occasion and appreciate your sacrifices. 

The skies will clear and families will want to travel again. We will be there with open arms to provide spaces to heal and recharge when this is over. 

With admiration and appreciation for your partnership,

Airbnb,Government-issued ID required?,"When attempting to book recently (my second booking, and having received a positive review from the first host), the site wants a government-issued ID. It's not clear to me if this request is being required by Airbnb or by the host. 

Airbnb already collects a lot of personal information, including photo, name, birth date, address, email address, phone number, and payment information. Airbnb also has information about our travel plans, communications with the hosts, and whatever hosts have to say about us and vice versa. The news reports daily about companies that have been hacked or accidentally exposed their customers' information. It's extremely difficult for any organization to avoid every potential vulnerability that can expose information. 

Adding a government-issued ID introduces a whole other level of risk. In order to send an image of your ID, you first have to take a picture of it and save it to your phone or computer. How many apps do you have on your phone or computer have permission to access all of your images? Probably quite a few. Also, smart phones and personal computers are themselves vulnerable to attack, so you've created another place that the information can be at risk.

Then you upload it to Airbnb, where hopefully proper controls are in place, and Airbnb will store it and (if I read the policy correctly) share it with their third party partner(s); again, we hope that it will be secure there.

I understand hosts need to know who will be staying in their homes. I'm very happy to use multifactor authentication when I make reservations if needed and present my government-issued ID when I arrive at the host's home. But uploading images of a government ID is really asking a lot of your guests.

Airbnb,Host Offered to go Off-Platform for Discounted Rate -- Any Downsides?,"I’ve stayed at this Airbnb twice now (booked through the site), and everything went well. Earlier this month, I was plugging in dates for a trip later this year but I didn’t book anything. Later that same day, the rates for the same dates had gone up (from $275 - $450/night). I messaged the host in-app and asked if it was possible to book for the lower amount (since that’s the rate I’d seen just a couple hours prior, and we’ve been repeat guests — it doesn’t hurt to ask).

The host responded to my email address (that was given to send/receive city-required documentation for our first stay) and said they could give me an even lower rate ($250/night) if I book directly through them. I know the whole point of Airbnb is to facilitate these transactions and protect both parties, but I’ve stayed at this place a few times (through Airbnb). At what point would it not be violating TOS to directly book a stay at a place I’ve frequented a few times?

Obviously, I would prefer to book directly on Airbnb and not mess with it, but the host just said that the prices have increased on the platform which I respect (but the $450/night is out of my price range). What other incentive would the host have for requesting I book directly?

Like I said, we have stayed at this location before; we like it and everything went well. He has a presence online and our previous transactions have been smooth, so I don’t think the host is a scammer.

AirBNB reached out to me instantly and offered me two choices: 100% of my money back to my card, or they would credit my account 110% the cost of my reservation so I could book again with someone else. 

This was instantaneous and totally automatic. The process was dead simple and I rebooked 2 hours later. But there is more:

A rep from AirBNB emailed me in just a few hours. She provided a phone number and an email address, as well as several alternative reservations at a similar price.

So AirBNB instantly and proactively fixed the problem with good technology **and** customer service personnel. 

If this had been Expedia, I would have found out when I showed up at the hotel, and I would have fought on the phone for hours to get the money back. Then I'd have to watch my bill like a hawk for weeks to make sure they actually returned it. Fuck Expedia. (Expedia also legit sold my info to mexican scammers and timeshare salesmen, true story!) 

I feel like AirBNB has earned some positive feedback. Good work AirBNB!",15,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/792trs/had_an_amazing_customer_service_experience/,2017-10-27 12:11:31,Expedia
Airbnb,Phoenix enacts rules for short term rentals,"Thought this was pretty interesting, most of it is standard like other cities have done. But the ""must respond to issues within one hour"" seems uh, kinda crazy. How are they going to enforce that? Is someone tracking violations or revoking permits for violators? How many violations do you get, before you are fined or have your permit revoked. Seems like the city opened up a rabbit hole, hope no one falls inside. The second articles seems like ""issues"" are only calls from police, so that's a little more reasonable - I think they are trying to limit party houses and noise violations with that, not, hey we ran out of coffee filters. 

Here's a couple articles with a little more info. I can't find the updated rules on the city site, yet.

Airbnb,Collecting Credit Card Information after booking for security deposit,"Hello everyone!

&#x200B;

I'm a fairly new host and I have run into some horrible guests.  When I listed my place I provided very clear house rules and stated that a $500 fine + damages will be charged if a guest were to break the rules. I also remind the guests to re-read the rules a few days before their check-in so that there are no issues.

 Fast forward to a guest I hosted who decided to ignore my rules and cook seafood and fish in my unit, make excessive noise after 10PM and stain the towels and left a mess in the kitchen. The odour was so bad that it's still lingering in my microwave and countertops after almost a month since the guest checked out. My cleaners had to take breaks while cleaning as it gave them and myself a headache. I could not return to my unit for over 12 hours.  The guest agreed that they broke the rules but decided not to pay. I provided airbnb with surveillance videos, photos right after the check-out but still have not been able to charge the guest. 

&#x200B;

This experience wasted a lot of my time and cost me a lot in cleaning. I've noticed that quite a few European airbnb listings require a security deposit at or before check-in and state this in their house rules. Has anyone tried this out? My plan is to ask for payment info for the deposit once the booking is confirmed and state this requirement in my listing to avoid shitty guests and be able to charge them if they break rules or cause damage.

&#x200B;

I've noticed that other platforms like [booking.com](https://booking.com) and VRBO allow the host to collect the deposit, so I think it should be pretty simple.",2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/bvnfpz/collecting_credit_card_information_after_booking/,2019-06-01 17:44:18,Expedia
Airbnb,AirBNB Chinese Company Listing in Japan (They dont speak Japanese) Is this common?,"My Fiancee and I are staying in Osaka for 2 months through an AirBNB and woke up this morning to someone painting the house and taping up all the windows. We had no confirmation of this so I called the host and they didn't know the listing off by hand or even by name / my name, he asked what website we booked with (expedia / airbnb)  and the confirmation number. He was really confused when I said someone is painting the house, and he said he doesn't know anything at all. I tried to hand the phone to the painter and say I speak little Japanese and so sorry, but the painter didn't understand him at all.. (turned out he was speaking Chinese) I spoke to the painter myself and he said it should take about one hour and we can leave and go (I think, but probably asking if we are or are not) he said he even knew this was an online hotel / airbnb. It turns out the hosts do not / speak only a little Japanese, both people I've spoken to keep saying just call back in a bit and on the message board say; ""I will get back to you soon"" from both host & cohost, they have no idea what's going on.

The host has a strange stock image looking photo and reverse image search shows that its probably not the host but they used a stock image, both the cohost and host are an image of a woman, but a man picks up the phone. The connection to the call is very poor making me think the phone number I call is not in Japan.

We never had to meet anyone when getting here, just had to upload a passport photo and unlock the keybox.

Wondering what anyone has to say about this or if its a common occurrence with Japanese airbnb listings.

One of my main concerns with this is, if they have someone doing maintenance inside the house within the next 2 months while we are out, maybe they won't even tell us since no one even knows when someone is coming by to paint.

Edit: The host has said: ""Hi, we're so sorry about the inconvenience. Please let us check with the housekeeper first."" Almost 2 hours have past since this whole situation began. Their English is very good by email, so I think they mean the cleaner, but it's strange the host has no information on house maintenance... I'm beginning to wonder if these people even have a minpaku license here now as well, I'd be stupid to ask for sure, the laws and regulations are apparently supposed to be very tight / restricted in Japan, the last airbnb we stayed at in Tokyo had a license number for the lodging on the door.

Double edit: They said they will paint tomorrow by email, but they are still painting now, they're pretending that the even know whats going on.

Also to add, the gas burner batteries died and the host wants me to buy them now. It worked a few times, the battery was dying to begin with.

The message said they cancelled the painting due to rain, but its sunny today, and hes still painting! The door is covered in plastic and tape and we don't even think we can go anywhere today because we would end up moving the plastic bag and tape where they are painting.. We are locked in for awhile it seems, better clean the clothes while we can and hope they don't cancel the trip based on all our questions, we are so confused now.",5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/df9foe/airbnb_chinese_company_listing_in_japan_they_dont/,2019-10-09 00:50:22,Expedia

Airbnb,Last Minute Rebooking - Worth Risking an untested listing?,"Heading to a convention over the holiday weekend. I was going to stay in a hotel but there was an AirBnB close to the convention center and that seemed like an idea solution (it was much, much cheaper, and I didn't care too much about quality since I'd be in the center most of the time).  The host was a super host with lots of reviews, which is why I thought it was good to go even at the very low price.

Just got cancelled on. No reason given. It looks like most of the hosts listens are 100% gone (they have one left). I'm guessing this might be a 'got caught renting out rooms in a way that was disallowed' or something. Anyway, no contact from the Host, just the standard 10% extra to book again through AirBnB.

The only other listens open seem to have 0 reviews & 100% availability, which is setting off a few red flags.  (It is also a mile further away and 2X the cost).

So I guess my question is do I just cut my losses and go with a hotel room at this point? Is there any point in contacting AirBnB Support? (I assume they are just gonna tell me to book what is available).  Is there any point at all sending a message to the host asking wtf happened?

For reference:

&#x200B;

My original reservation: \~200$

&#x200B;

Price of Hotel at time of original reservation: \~660$

&#x200B;

Price of only remaining compatible location on AirBnB (still within walking distance, no reviews, bad quality photos): 406$

&#x200B;

Price of only comparable listing on VRBO (still within walking distance, no reviews, host account is called ""owner"" :|): \~300$

&#x200B;

Current price of Hotel: \~850$

&#x200B;

If I rebook through AirBnB, they'll give me an extra 20$ for the inconvenience... wooo?

I've done a few AirBnB's, but only well established places, I have no clue what the success rate people have for listings that look brand new / unused...  Honestly, I think 300/400 is a fair price for a 6 night stay, particularly when the motel 6's are charging 100+/night, the extra distance annoys me more :/  


Edit: I should note the VRBO listing shows up on Expedia and has the regularly expected pictures of the place. It only hit my red flags due to no reviews and the hosts name is owner.

Airbnb,Disappointing Rental - Remedy?,"So I’m currently stuck in a really disappointing Airbnb.  There is literally NOWHERE else in town that I could move to due to the holidays in a popular, and small, destinations.  Basically, my problems began when I checked in and found there was no safe in the room.  This was clearly listed as an amenity on the listing page and in the welcome email, and this is an area known for break-ins.  The host said he would accept liability for my possessions, so I reported it to Airbnb and let it slide.  The next morning I discovered that my unit isn’t fully self-contained and the wall between it and the neighboring unit is not a real wall.  I can hear EVERY word spoken by the people next door, when they use a normal voice, and they are actually quite partial to shouting.  Today I also discovered that there are problems with the boiler, and I can only get hot water by calling the host and having him come “kick it into gear”.  Hot water was one of the few amenities listed on the site (along with the safe). There is not even a table and chairs, or a place to hang a pair of pants or dress, although the unit is advertised as a “suite”.  My host offered to cancel and refund my reservation,  but there is nothing left in town on Airbnb, Booking or Expedia.  I also walked around and checked at about twenty hotels and none have availability.  I have only stayed in a few Airbnb’s before and I’ve never felt like I was being scammed before, but I am so upset and just can’t imagine staying here for another full week.  What would you guys do in this situation? ",5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/a9vpr8/disappointing_rental_remedy/,2018-12-27 04:01:46,Expedia
Airbnb,Why I will never use Airbnb again…,"My husband, mom, me our two dogs booked a week long stay as we were coming town for my uncles celebration of life. Obviously with two dogs an Airbnb is much more ideal than a hotel. 

The home had 8 reviews, a 4.38 rating. 

We paid a total of $2395 for a 1 week stay. 

We arrived to the home to find the weeds were two feet tall, junk was laying around in the yard, and the house clearly needed some love (front porch was rotting). I figured oh well, not ideal but whatever. We open the door and are immediately greeted by an overwhelming smell of urine. After looking around the house, it is clear the smell is coming from a small room that has no furniture. The door is closed. The room houses the router and WiFi stuff. We also notice the smoke detectors have been cut off, and the back sliding door has no lock. It had a latch, but there was nothing for the door to latch into. There was an old dilapidated short piece of wood being used as a “lock” in the bottom of the door track. 

I immediately called Airbnb and said since of course we cannot stay here, we would like a refund or to be put in a comparable home. They said well first you need to try to work it out with the host. 

Contacted the host, he said the house was cleaned yesterday, there is no smell, etc. The house WAS Cleaned. There were still fresh vacuum marks on the carpet. However, it is clear the urine had soaked to the baseboard given the smell. After going back and forth, the host stated it’s a nice house, and he paid 1.2 million for it….cool, idgaf if you paid 10 million, the house is a shit hole. The host also said he cut the smoke detectors bc they were beeping bc the batteries needed to be replaced…..

We end up booking two hotel rooms. We did not stay in the house for more than 30 minutes. 

Airbnb ends up offering us a $75 refund. 

I eventually reached out to Airbnb’s CEO, VP of Community Support, and several other executives. I asked for a full refund. 

We were then connected with the executive resolution team. After 5 days of back and forth, we we’re refunded $1700. Not the whole amount, but I feel like that’s all we will get. 

Absolutely unbelievable that it was this hard to get a refund (and not a full one!).  

So, TLDR: House reeked of urine, was unsafe to stay in due to cut smoke detectors and a non locking back door. After reaching out to the exec team we got back $1700 of our $2395. I will never book an Airbnb again.

Airbnb,Host is imposing a $750 late check-in fee. What options do I have?,"I'm planning a trip for a party of 8 in Seattle next week. Over a month ago, I messaged the host (it is a company, not a person) asking for information about the check-in process. They replied that they will contact me 1 week prior to my stay.

This week, they message me saying that check-in must be in-person between 4-6pm on my arrival date. This is impossible for me, as my whole party had booked flights that arrive between 10:30pm and 11pm, so the earliest we would arrive to the AirBNB would be around 11pm. Mind you, the listing at first glance says that check-in is ""after 4:00pm,"" though under the cut it states 4pm to 6pm in the middle of what appears to be a full novel of a contract. I measured the scroll bar, and it's 1cm long.

The contract also does not EXPLICITLY state that guests MUST check in in-person. One has to infer that. The language they use is ""any in person check in is required to provide valid identification to the check in host at the time of check in."" This is the only place in the whole novel of a contract that states we are to be checking in in-person.

The other, more visible, place that it talks about check-in is in this paragraph:

>""Check-in is available between 4:00 pm and 6:00 pm on the date of Renter's arrival; a 30-minute window needs to be scheduled a minimum of 24 hours in advance (unless same day booking) with the Manager/ check-in host and a time confirmed. If renter is late past the check-in window the renter will pay up to $75 per 30 minutes as a wait fee.""

The thing is, they wouldn't be ""waiting"" as I am telling them ahead of time I will not be there before 11pm.

I called AirBNB support and they said I have no grounds to dispute this and I have to take it up with the host. Yes, I wish I had read all of the 7,464 words under the cut in the house rules. Is there any way out?

Another lovely piece of the ""house rules"" that I found while reading today:

>""Any defamatory, libelous, or slanderous review posted on any public forum will incur a $100 per day fee until removed.""

I feel so scammed. Any help is appreciated.

Edit: The cancellation policy is 50% refund 2 months in advance of the stay. Any later than that and there is no refund.

Edit 2: My boyfriend did some digging and found their Yelp reviews: [https://www.yelp.com/biz/luxury-sleep-accommodations-chelan-5](https://www.yelp.com/biz/luxury-sleep-accommodations-chelan-5) I am floored at how many others have had this exact experience with this company.

Edit 3: So since this post is getting a bit of traction, I'd like to provide a little more info. Part of the ""house rules"" states that guests must sign a contract before check-in and asks for a valid ID via an outside form ( [https://www.jotform.com/211386438413152](https://www.jotform.com/211386438413152) ). The contract contains all of the extra fees including the waiting fee, the bad review fee, and a host of other fees (many of which are between $750 and $1500). They state that without my signature, they will not check us in. I'm assuming that my bank will not accept any claims I make if I sign this contract... I think I'm stuck.

\-----

**FINAL EDIT**: After 5 phone calls to AirBNB, 32 messages to a support person who responded every 6 hours and then 3 calls to my bank, AIRBNB REFUNDED MY ENTIRE STAY OF $2,429.10!!! Before this happened, my party decided to cut our losses and book a hotel - we figured that this scummy host would weasel in as many fees as they're able to and it would probably end up well over $750 if we stayed.

I've said this to those who DMed me, but I was so encouraged by all of your comments and offers to help. I saw 5 new reviews pop up on their Yelp page since I've made this post. Some of you have contacted AirBNB on my behalf. I have never received so much support from a community, and I am so thankful.

I am going to take the next day or two to write scathing reviews of this company and detail exactly the steps I took to get a refund. I saw that many others were unable to get refunded, so hopefully this post can help someone like you all have helped me.

**HOW I GOT MY REFUND:**

I make most of my commentary on the images inside the imgur links.

To start, these were the house rules under the cut: [https://imgur.com/a/kU849Jn](https://imgur.com/a/kU849Jn) I've highlighted areas of note (fees, inconsistencies).

Notable text on the listing: [https://imgur.com/a/OAw7Nk5](https://imgur.com/a/OAw7Nk5)

My messages with the host: [https://imgur.com/a/kswzD7p](https://imgur.com/a/kswzD7p)

My messages with AirBNB: [https://imgur.com/a/bFQArut](https://imgur.com/a/bFQArut) I've highlighted everything I said that I thought actually helped me along.

Wells Fargo was very helpful. They almost cancelled my credit card twice because they thought I was reporting fraud. They said that a fee for ""wrongfully disputing a credit card charge"" sounds illegal and it is unlikely that AirBNB would help enforce this.

The thing I did MOST RIGHT, though, was NOT signing the contract that they emailed me. If I had signed that, I would (probably) have no grounds for disputing anything. I'm sure that the hosts on this sub who reached out for me also made a difference in the outcome, along with all of the reporting and new 1-star reviews that everyone has been leaving.

Airbnb,"Accidentally book an AirBnB thru Hotels.com and I hate it [Nantucket, MA]","I booked what I thought was a regular inn via hotels.com (NON REFUNDABLE), but it’s actually an AirBnB. It did NOT say that in the description. I’ve never used AirBnB before, so I guessed I missed clues.

Airbnb,Host faked a text from me to get review removed,"If Airbnb doesn’t have reviews, they don’t have anything. After 7 years traveling with the platform, I am DONE with Airbnb for good, and I need to vent. 

We checked out of a spectacular apartment in Morocco, because it was partially booked during our stay. No big deal, we booked into another place—right down the street. Similar price, slightly lower rating, but similarly glowing reviews. No reason to suspect anything wrong.

Checked in and the everything seems okkkk…nothing was quite right, but nothing was egregious either—except the wifi didn’t work. I contacted the host and he led me around in circles for literally the whole time. 

Night time came, and we realized that the small beds did not have sheets. That is pretty gross, but we just laid the extra blankets on top for my kids.

Next day, the stove didn’t work, and we noticed the restroom began smelling like sewage. I’m trying to complain to the host, but we’re still arguing about the wifi, so he’s just sort of ignoring everything. I managed to turn the gas on myself to make my coffee, but then the whole kitchen smells like propane. Naturally, I turn it off, and we are unable to cook for the remainder of our trip.

After day 3 (checkout day), all 4 of us have developed a pretty bad cough—that is still lingering for myself and my youngest 3 weeks later. I won’t say it’s definitely the apartment, but my wife mentioned she suspects they never wash the blankets and that’s what’s giving us the cough.

So we checkout, and I leave my review, which mentions all of this (except the cough, I did not mention this, because I just don’t know for sure). I wasn’t looking for Airbnb to do anything about it. It’s just that all of the reviews are all positive, and I want people to know our honest experience—no wifi, probable gas leak, smells like sewage, blankets not washed. He gives me a decent review btw, because I’m sure I’ve only mildly inconvenienced him.

NEXT DAY: I got a message from Airbnb saying that my review has been removed for violating their terms and some sort of mark has been put on my record. That’s weird, so I contact support, and they will not give me any information. Probably 50+ messages later, I finally get it out of them that I have COERCED the host into letting me have a party, and the review probably doesn’t reflect my actual experience.

WHAT. THE. FUCK. Does that even mean. 

I got them to send me the “proof”. Here it is for your entertainment: https://imgur.com/a/7p1HknJ

I’m obviously livid, because it’s not even proper English—Google translate probably would have done a better job. Not only that, but I somehow managed to “send” him this WhatsApp message about 12 hours BEFORE he gave me his number, which IS documented in our Airbnb messages (wouldn’t they check those?). It seems the host likely got AM and PM confused when he faked this message.

By the way, during this time after my review was removed, I was requested to pay an additional €22 for “additional cleaning”. His proof of the “damage” that I caused was the blankets sitting at the foot of the beds with no sheets. Like I was supposed to fucking put them away. I obviously refuted that, saying I always put blankets at the foot of the bed to make it easier to WASH BETWEEN GUESTS.

So anyway, a WEEK and a dozen messages later after pointing out the difference between AM and PM, they send me a message saying “you’re probably right and your review has been reinstated”. Good fucking grief.

I said, “that is ABSOLUTE LEAST you can do. I have no reason to trust Airbnb at all if guys like this are allowed to operate AT ALL.”

About two days later, I got a message saying my review had been removed AGAIN. For the same reason.

I contacted support again, went through the whole circus AGAIN. And today, I got messages from both threads: they decided against me on the €22, and they decided against me on getting my review reinstated.

Here’s proof that he didn’t give me his number until 12 hours after this message was sent: https://imgur.com/a/96ynkja

7 years of business to Airbnb. The last 3 years or so have been increasingly rocky, and this is it. Airbnb doesn’t have licensing or legal standards to keep up. If I can’t trust the reviews, I don’t have anything. So this is it. Goodbye forever.

Edit: 3h after posting this (just now), Airbnb overturned their final decision and reinstated my review for the second time.

Airbnb can be a risk. There are too many scams on the platform, and the company has a history of not standing behind guests that find themselves stranded without a place to stay – or hosts whose properties are poorly treated.

But the platform that connects people who want to rent their real estate, and guests looking for a place to stay (at a hefty fee to both parties), has a real place.

Destinations without good hotel options. I’ve used them on the Texas Gulf Coast, Martha’s Vineyard, and parts of Australia’s Gold Coast for instance.
Larger accommodations, where multiple families or large families might want to stay together and over longer periods of time with residential-style amenities.
Sure, cleaning fees that still leave you with a chore list of cleaning to do before departure gets most of the bad press. But here’s a shocking case where guests were really at the mercy of a property owner that treated them badly – with Airbnb nowhere to be found.

A senior citizen – an Airbnb Superhost himself – booked a house for 8 siblings to stay in for their brother’s funeral. A total of 5 of them actually stayed at the property. Over the course of the week several people came over to pay condolences and care for the family.

Properties may have maximum guest numbers to comply with local ordinances, or additional charges for larger number of guests to discourage parties and damage. Though only 5 people spent the night at the property,

The Airbnb host watched them on camera and saw visitors come over then demanded they pay $5,000 additional dollars as though more people than registered were staying and threatened to kick them out if they refused.

Airbnb contacted the 70 year old man to demand the additional payment. The host claimed the seniors “caused community disturbance.” Before the funeral they were evicted “at midnight, with their suitcases, grocery bags & nowhere to go.” At 2 a.m. before the funeral, with the help of family members, they found a budget hotel to move to. The guest was blocked from the platform as a host, so that he couldn’t manage his rental properties either.

The homesharing platform became responsive – only after the man’s son, a lawyer, had his tweets about the incident go viral.

To be sure, outlier events happen in hotels, you’re never fully protected anywhere you go. But there’s a company to go after when staying with a chain, and if nothing else tort liability helps align incentives. To date that hasn’t seemed to be the case with Airbnb.",1233,147,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/14mkqyv/5_seniors_evicted_from_airbnb_at_midnight_before/,2023-06-30 00:00:55,Booking.com
Airbnb,Expedia? Booking.com? Any advice on if it's worth adding other channels?,"I currently list my STR properties on Airbnb and VRBO.  

The Airbnb guests are generally very good, especially since Airbnb started working to eliminate party-guests.  VRBO guests are decent, but tend to be a little more high-maintenance and act like they're staying at a hotel.  I assume the difference has to do with the demographic and also that guest reviews are a bigger part of the Airbnb ecosystem (bad reviews from hosts actually mean something on Airbnb). 

Has anyone had luck with other channels besides Airbnb and VRBO?  Looking for channels that can generate enough volume to be worth the integration effort, and also have decent and considerate guests.  I tried [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) a couple years ago and the guests were so bad, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.  They mostly trashed my houses and the payments would fail all the time.  Also, their website is such a complicated mess that it's borderline impossible to figure out what they're doing (for example, they required me to login and manually pay invoices on each property separately so they could get their commissions, wtf).  I'll never use them again.

Anyone having luck with channels other that Airbnb and VRBO?   My properties are in North Carolina - Charlotte and Asheville.

Airbnb,AirBnB now banning interior cameras in all properties [USA],"Article here: https://www.wired.com/story/airbnb-indoor-security-camera-ban/ 

Airbnb will soon ban hosts from watching their guests with indoor security cameras, as the company is reversing course on its surveillance policies.

As of April 30, hosts around the world must remove indoor cameras and disclose other outdoor monitoring tech to guests before they book. Airbnb previously allowed hosts to install security cameras in common areas of a home, like hallways and living rooms. But it also required hosts to disclose them, make them clearly visible, and keep the cameras out of places like sleeping areas and bathrooms.

Still, the cameras have been an issue. Guests have reported encountering hidden cameras in their short-term rentals. For hosts, the cameras can be a way to discourage guests from throwing large parties or to stop the gatherings before they become too disruptive. It’s a big enough concern that several companies have started making noise monitoring tech, billing themselves as solutions to protect short-term rentals.

But guests see them as an invasion of privacy—a watching eye intruding on their vacation.

“We're really grateful that Airbnb listened to those of us pushing back and calling for them to actually put safety and privacy first,” says Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a pro-privacy organization.

In its announcement, Airbnb said that the majority of its listings do not mention a security camera, so the rule change may not affect most listings. Vrbo, another short-term rental platform, already banned the use of visual and audio surveillance inside of properties.

Airbnb says it will investigate reported violations of the rule, and may penalize violators by removing their listings or accounts. But this policy may struggle to address the camera problem at large, as the company has already required hosts to disclose the indoor cameras, and guests have sometimes reported hidden and undisclosed cameras.

The new rules also require hosts to disclose to guests whether they are using noise decibel monitors or outdoor cameras before guests book. Both are used by some hosts to monitor properties for parties, which have continued to bring noise, damage, and danger even after Airbnb instituted a party ban and employed new anti-party tech to try to prevent revelers from booking on its site. Airbnb will also prohibit hosts from using outdoor cameras to monitor indoor spaces, and bars them from “certain outdoor areas where there’s a greater expectation of privacy,” such as outdoor showers and saunas, it says.

“This just emphasizes the fact that surveillance always gives a huge amount of power to whoever controls the camera system,” says Fox Cahn. “When it's used in a property you're renting, whether it's a landlord or an Airbnb, it's ripe for abuse.”",302,298,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1bc7hsa/airbnb_now_banning_interior_cameras_in_all/,2024-03-11 16:35:27,Booking.com

Airbnb,Airbnb search changes.

He mentioned that listing titles are no longer the driving force or even seen in searches.  He could be wrong but he seems to be quite successful and not sure why he would lie about these new changes. 

Anyhow, what I took from what he said was that newcomers to airbnb site probably wont find a more normal listing as easily and that vrbo and bookings dot com sites are what you need to bring people to your listing.

Thoughts?  I've looked at booking site and it looks kinda sterile and difficult, vrbo looks nicer but that doesn't mean anything I suppose.

Airbnb,[UPDATE] Host WAS imposing a $750 late check-in fee. They're now talking about legal action for my previous post.,"So per my final update to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/y5x3cc/host_is_imposing_a_750_late_checkin_fee_what/), AirBnB sided with me and provided me a near $2,500 refund after the host I booked with (Luxsle Corp/Luxury Sleep Accommodations/Luxury Virtual Staging) tried to charge me $150 per hour fee to check in at 11pm.

They sent me a new message today: [https://imgur.com/a/FUIrIWh](https://imgur.com/a/FUIrIWh)

It wasn't unexpected. They've responded this way to numerous other people. Am I right in assuming that they have no basis for taking legal action against me?

My concern is they also seem to be threatening me, dropping my Reddit username and that they know what my occupation is. I've already reported them to AirBnB.

Thanks again for reading.

Edit: To update for anyone interested, AirBnB has reached out to me to discuss this case. I don't know what that means but I hope it means we're getting somewhere. I haven't gotten a chance to reply to everyone but I'm appreciative of the continued support!! :)

Airbnb,Take note from Booking.com Brian. Here's what a real partnership is.,"This is what [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) sent out today. Take note Brian. It’s never too late to learn. That's a real partnership. Not your HotAirbnb.

*Dear partner,*

*We understand that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on your business, just as it has on ours. We're committed to supporting you as best as we possibly can. Our teams have been working around the clock on solutions to help you retain as many reservations as possible in these challenging times.*

*Suspending Force Majeure*

*In support of this, last week we shared that our Force Majeure conditions wouldn't apply to bookings made Monday, April 6, and forward. This means you're in control of how to respond to cancellation requests for reservations made on or after this date (as explained in our message to you on Friday, April 3).*

*Force Majeure Guest Agreements*

*We're also working to help you protect revenue from reservations made before Monday, April 6, when our Force Majeure conditions still applied. If guests are seeking a cancellation, we'll support you by exploring their alternative options with them, outlined below.*

*For these reservations, we expect you to respect the inability of guests to stay as intended. We ask that you—to the satisfaction of the guest—arrange:*

*•	New dates for a future stay through* [*Booking.com*](https://Booking.com) *(different rates may apply), or*

*•	A voucher issued by you for a future stay worth the value paid by the guest or a higher amount at your discretion, or*

*•	A full refund of any prepayment/deposit.*

*We won't charge commission in cases where the reservation is canceled due to Force Majeure.*

*Minimizing Force Majeure Cancellations*

*While we share the desire for having as many guests as possible stay with you, the current situation is preventing them from doing so. That's why we're actively encouraging customers to choose the date change option wherever we can. We do this by highlighting the opportunity to reschedule, making this option the most prominent on our site, app, and via our Customer Service teams.*

*We've also built tooling to make these date changes happen as quickly and easily as possible. Both you and your guests can now modify reservation dates without needing to call our Customer Service teams. For more info on managing date modifications, visit our Partner Hub.*

*To ensure as many guests as possible choose a date change over a refund, we encourage you to make sure your availability is up-to-date on our platform and loaded as far into the future as possible.*

*Stay informed*

*We'll be updating you regularly about our ongoing work to support you as the COVID-19 situation continues to unfold. For the most up-to-date news and info, keep checking our Partner Hub.*

*Yours in partnership,*

Airbnb,Is Booking(dot)com trying to kill Airbnb?,"First, no I don't work for either company. I just travel a lot -- even during the pandemic. 

I just booked an apartment in a popular Southern Mexican city. On Airbnb, the total cost -- after service fees -- was over $400.

If I was Airbnb, I'd be very worried about this. Is there any advantage to using Airbnb? The customer service? Well, I've traveled a lot and found the customer service at Booking(dot)com is really just as good as Airbnb. And they both have a messaging feature on the app.

Airbnb,"Host set absurd and unreasonable rules. Are they legal/enforceable? [TX, US]","My friend accidentally booked this crazy listing not seeing ""Additional rules"" he agreed to. Some seem absolutely excessive - not using ""own items"", ""no shaving"", fee for leaving ceiling fan on, etc. Airbnb support says host can set any rules they want. Anything can be done about it? 

- No staying in the room during the day Monday through Friday (9am until 5pm). This is just a room to sleep and not a place to camp/work all day. 
- No music or TV or any kind of talking after midnight. No entering / leaving the home between 12am and 5am.
- Please maintain 6' distance at all times from all people in the household. Do not engage with other guests. Keep conversations politically correct and respectful. 
-You can use the kitchen anytime between 6am - 9:00am and 5pm-10pm. Dispose of all organic matter (including oils/ grease) in the trash bin.
- Living room and backyard are off limits (private / dog training). 
- Washer and Dryer: 1 load per 1 week of stay (does not include linens). Outside temperature must be above 45 degrees (F) in order to operate the washer. Running the washer during freezing temperatures will burst the pipes and you'll be responsible for all damages. Please schedule a time with me in order to activate the washer.
- Please do not expect direct interaction from me. Maintain communication via Airbnb messaging. If I’m wearing headphones please do not interrupt unless it is an emergency.
- Luci, my dog, will try to make friends with you; if you don’t like Black Labs you cannot stay here. He is a lover and if you treat him poorly you'll be asked to leave the premises. 
-No COVID exposure or symptoms. Anyone regularly coughing will be required to leave the premises immediately.
- Do not take any supplies or items with you; only use items provided inside the home while on premises.
-Familiarize yourself with the amenities provided and prepare accordingly.
- No shaving in the bathroom sink. Doing so will result in a $175 fee.
- Dispose of all trash in cans located in the kitchen area. You will be charged $50 for any trash that needs to be disposed of after yourself (including water bottles or leftover food).
- You break it, you pay for it. No modifications to any of the rooms allowed.
- No guns or illegal substances allowed. No criminal records.
-Ceiling fans / bathroom exhaust will be turned off if you’re not in the room or bathroom. Please make an effort to leave them turned off before you leave and help save electricity. Failure to do so will result in a $50 fee.
- If you leave the fridge open or front door open or windows open you will be charged $50 per occurrence.
- Check out is 11am. Late check out starts at 11:30am. $100 fee per every hour of delay.
-Please be careful when entering/exiting the property. There are small steps in the walkway and a small front door ledge. Not liable for slips and falls or tripping.  
- Watch your step while inside the property. Flooring is black porcelain and changes in temperature or terrain may cause uneven surfaces. Not liable for slips and falls or tripping.

EDIT/UPDATE:

Asked host if the rules are negotiable, she complained to Airbnb support that I am blackmailing her. Here's all the interaction that she reported as blackmailing:


Me: Hi, how strict is your ""no staying inside during the day"" thing? 


Her: Hi *name*,
Most definitely not during the week. Weekends are ok to stay in.
The room is designed for those who go to school or work during the day and need a clean and peaceful place to sleep 🙂


Me: My friend booked your room not seeing your additional rules, he wanted a quiet and peaceful place to apply for jobs and sleep. He is moving from Poland and it would be a major disruption if he's unable to be inside at all during the day. I understand that you set your rules, but I can assure that it would not make it less clean or peaceful for you. Would you be able to accommodate an exception?

He got a phone call from Airbnb informing that I was ""blackmailing"" her.
Then got a message:

- Hi *name*, This is one of the Airbnb support ambassadors. Hope all is well. As discussed with you on call, please inform your friend *my name* stop sending messages to Host *her name*, because it's not allowed as per Airbnb policies. Best regards, Team Airbnb



Update 2 (5 days in): 
Host lied about him leaving windows open, contacted airbnb ""support"" and they are canceling his reservation without refund, basically stealing $1300 from a 20 year old that moved to US 3 days ago. He just opened a window in his room while he was inside - she took a picture of open window. Apparently it is enough to do a no refund cancelation. 

Legally, what's the best was to proceed? Small claims court? Police report? Escalate to Airbnb executives?

It is now 3 days before his arrival and he is asking me to waive the cancelation fees because he is allegedly sick. I really want to reject the request but am worried that if I do not reply and/or reject his request that he will just leave a poor review as soon as he can (I only have 11 reviews so far with average score of 9.4).

The day before I checked out, they reminded me for a THIRD time to do the laundry in official Airbnb communications. I'm here on a work conference, I'm not here relaxing on a month long stay—the VERY LAST thing I want to do while I'm running around for work everyday is do your chores that you're making me pay for through exorbitant cleaning fees. I snapped. Here's what I responded with:

> Hello x, in the spirit of communication before writing reviews, as you say, I’m not particularly happy at being asked to do laundry several times in these official checkins. I’m paying a rather steep cleaning fee, and I’m being asked to check out earlier than the customary 11am so that the cleaning crew can come in. I would expect that the crew do the laundry for what I’m paying—as a customer, not as a casual house guest. As such, I will not be separating laundry and starting a load as you request since such duties, beyond my own personal preferences, were not stated in the listing or the house rules prior to booking. I would appreciate not being asked to do laundry for a fourth time. Thank you.

They responded immediately—terrified—asking for us to both not write each other reviews and that I did not have to do laundry. Then they made some longwinded explanation about how they ask for laundry to be done as ""a gesture of kindness"" (LMFAO, a gesture that you're charging me almost $200 for), that the messages are automated, and that the only way they can logistically clean the place before bringing in new guests is if I save them an hour by starting the laundry before I go. Otherwise they have to pay the cleaners more and it delays the next check in. 

**NEWSFLASH** You're charging me almost $200 in cleaning fees. I am not obligated to help you logistically turn over your rental for the next person. I am not a casual house guest, I am a paying customer. If you plan your turn over so tight that it won't work without asking me to do your chores, then *change your schedule*. Don't ask me to do work for you.

These are corporate hosts. I asked them details about the space (do the sleeping areas have doors?) and they didn't even know.

Airbnb,Walked out halfway through my 5 week dream Villa stay. No idea if I'll ever see any refund. Or another Airbnb.,"Death by a million cuts is the best way to describe this and Airbnb support is ridiculously useless.

Want to know why I went from thinking AirBNB is like a life-hack to probably getting banned? Turns out AirBNB is a bad choice for any important trip.

I should have studied Airbnb's overly complicated check-in policies before my arrival to protect myself from THIS. But I made bad assumptions. Assumptions that AirBNB encourages you to make, by the way, considering they prominently say you're protected with guarantees all over their website. I'd laugh if I wasn't still so livid.

It all started because I never should have accepted the slightest change inside the villa from what I expected at check in, no matter how small or fixable.

I was so enamored with the location that I'd searched so hard to find. [Here's the view, see what I mean?](https://imgur.com/a/B9ujX4f). When you arrive from the airport with a half dozen bags and family of 4 in tow including your 9 year old son, you just want to get in the pool. And everyone in my group was already taking selfies and smiling. Let's just get this check-in over with.

The kitchen was pretty filthy. But whatever. We'll be here for a long time and can clean it up quick. And the listing includes 2 professional cleanings a week. (Narrator Voice: The cleaners never come)

There was an unexpected long and steep trail, like about 500’ long, from the villa from the car parking area. But don't worry, the manager lady said, there's a small vehicle that can drive you and all your groceries to the room (ominous foretelling).

Where's the BBQ? I had been dreaming for months about spending the summer here with a beer and grilling burgers. ""Don't worry, we'll bring the bbq tomorrow.""

The ceiling fans aren't working, but again, ""don't worry, our tech will handle it tomorrow.""

I should have called Airbnb immediately and asked for the ""check-in guarantee"". Because now I know this is (probably) the last possible minute that Airbnb gives a rip. Wait until tomorrow and that option is gone and Airbnb will put you on read for the rest of your trip.

That night I slept (poorly) in a 90 degree room. ""Oh sorry, we'll come by the next day to fix the air-conditioning.""

The BBQ arrived 2 days later: [here's the bbq](https://imgur.com/a/4ljnYAn). ""We can't really use this because of the rust, any chance you've got something better?"", I felt dismayed. ""Oh, this is the one everybody uses and never complain before. Sorry"".

Damn. Whatever. We'll work around it. Good attitude. But it's a listed amenity... and I guess this is technically a BBQ.

The next afternoon we go to stock up on groceries, one of those huge shopping trips where you buy 24 pack cases of beers and water and soda, and everything. All together it fills the trunk of the car and half the back seat. It's all dropped off at the lobby by our taxi, but the electric villa car driver downright refuses to help. ""Sorry, you villa no can car"". He doesn't speak much English at all. But he's definitely not going to help. At all. WTF. So one by one we each relay the boxes and bags down the 500 foot trail.

A few days later, a few more ""tech support"" calls for outlets not working, the microwave not working, light bulbs going out all over the place, eventually I thought the move in pains would be done for. 

Now it's time to relax and recharge. 

Then the gorgeous infinity pool started to turn [green and slimy](https://imgur.com/a/oN6U87l). ""No, can't be, our pool guy comes by twice a week"" they said. I sent the manager [underwater video showing the murky view](https://i.imgur.com/9j3uqiU.mp4) from my GoPro. ""OMG"" was the reply. ""I'll check with the pool guy"". A few days later he arrives. It took a week before the pool was clear again.

I was starting to despair a little by this point. So. Many. Problems. But they eventually got mostly fixed (kinda) after a day or two. It felt like I was a guinea pig. Like I was the project manager dealing with a punch list. It felt like they must think I'm the most complaining guy ever. But I also felt that if I didn't stay on top of it, they'd leave and never return.

Then the bomb dropped, or I should say was just about to drop, 20 days in. Based on the AirBNB listing I had agreed to pay utilities - an amount roughly equal to $3 per cubic meter of water. My total should be like... $30 for the whole trip. Oh, also, I was required to give $600 cash deposit at check in. 

I know, I know. Airbnb says to [not deal with money outside the platform](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/140/security-deposits). But according to this page:

""There is one exception: Hosts who manage their listings with API-connected software can set a security deposit using our offline fees feature outside of Airbnb.” 

How would I know? It was suspicious to me. I also found this [other article on Airbnb](https://i.imgur.com/LVuq7rs.png) that reassured me. I asked the host about it. He mentioned the deposit in his listing. He says they are a hotel and real business with receipts and everything. Surely AirBNB knows he's asking on his listing as they approved it (right???).

So by this time, it occurred to me to check on the utility meters and I was STUNNED to discover that we'd already consumed a volume equivalent to about three 20' sea shipping containers. 100 cubic meters. In 20 days, with 4 people. Impossible. That is like 4 entire swimming pools.

The host agrees, ""seems high"". ""Ok great"", I said, ""let's get on the same page, how are you going to charge water now?"". ""According to the meter"". Ummm. How's that going to work? ""Don't worry, you won't have to pay for the leak, just according to the meter"". Come on man. Figure this out. ""Dude, that makes no sense. Why don't we agree on some average family usage now, so that when I'm checking out we don't have a big miscommunication"". 

I even googled for average household water consumption in various regions of the world to get an estimate. (It's about 25-50 cubic meters a YEAR per person, if you wondered). I shared my newfound knowledge with the host.

""No, we won't discuss until checkout.""

""???""

""No, we won't discuss until checkout.""

Shit. Now at this point I'm getting red hot under the collar. This is red flag galore time. I'm never going to see my deposit again. I'm going to be extorted by a $1000 water bill an hour before my flight out of here and the police are going to have to come. We need to decide how to fix this now.

So we're getting nowhere. This guy becomes obstinate. He absolutely refuses to name a total. He absolutely refuses to say how he'll calculate it later. But somehow on our day of checking out, he'll know.

Days of this are going goes by and now I'm losing sleep. The water meter is spinning wildly when everything inside the house is turned off. Like, seriously feeling stressed and anxious about this whole situation. The ""I'm getting cheated alarm"" is going off in my mind. I'm even documenting the meter hour by hour to see how much is getting lost.

I start looking for other signs of cheating. Hey, where's the cleaner who's supposed to be here twice a week? They haven't come yet. I ask and of course he says ""that was for pre-covid rates, now we don't do it because your price is too low, sorry.""

But it's in your listing! 

""Sorry, have a nice day"" is the response.

We mention the water leak to the girl in the lobby. ""Oh, you should meet the HOA president, he knows about this.""

So we learned that the owner of our villa owes the HOA like $75k in past due bills. There was a surprise huge water bill last month, which they didn't pay. Their villa is an illegal AirBNB he thinks with no proper registration. The HOA has to tell guests of our villa all the time they don't get to use the community resources like the gym (which was also in the listing of course).

I ask Airbnb for help. A bit desperately. If you've ever done the same, maybe you have an idea what happens next. A full day passes before the first reply. Then 5 minutes later that guy's shift ends and he hands the ticket it to another customer service rep who promptly marked it closed. Then another full day passes. I ask for help more urgently. I submit everything I have. 

I get a copy/paste reply. It seems like they are trying to discuss with the host behind the scenes. I reply instantly for clarification. More copy/paste hell responses. Another day goes by. I get a message from AirBNB that says the host promised them he won't cheat us about the water. So we can relax now. 

I explain again about the amenities just discovered and missing. The burned out lights over the stairs safety problem. The disaster that's unfolding. He's already cheating me. I feel like almost daily I'm ""reporting"" a new amenities issue or safety issue with AirBnB. The worst feeling.

The next reply from AirBnBis basically sorry, this isn't something we can help with. We recommend you use the ""ask for money"" feature and see if the host will refund you.

I decided to sleep on it. Maybe I can just chill. Meditate for an hour. Find more zen here, which is why I came. But I wake at 4 am and can't sleep anymore. I sit on the deck and drink my coffee while looking towards the dark sea and morning stars. Damn, [the view](https://imgur.com/a/s93ApYQ) here is so good. But why does this cause so much stress. This isn't why I'm here. My life is too short for this. I need close this and mentally move on.

Then an idea comes to me. I'm just going to leave. Fuck these fucks for ruining my time.

My wife wakes a few hours later and I tell her my plan: book another place today. Go. Fight more on Airbnb if we can. If they give us the runaround, charge back the whole thing with my bank. My credit card company will look at it as service not as described, I think. I have a fuck ton of chat messages and pictures showing I'm not getting what I paid for. AirBNB can fight this chargeback with my bank if they don't want to talk with me in the support chat. This AirBnB ""customer service"" has wasted 5 days to tell me they can't help. I assume no answer means the answer is no.

If I get banned from AirBnB? Great. The feeling is mutual.

###Tl;Dr: 

scammer hosts know how to make your AirBNB experience a disaster. And AirBNB customer service enables them.

###Updates
Last Week: I've tweeted at @airbnbhelp. They replied after a few hours with a nice copy paste to say they urged their own internal team to reply.

Last Friday: Took out a Twitter ad and posted the video of the pool. It got 35k views and 40 retweets at @airbnb. Still no progress. But maybe some of those 35k people will reconsider AirBnb next time.

Monday: Now over 100k impressions on my Twitter campaign. I truly hope that I've influenced a potential customer or two to reconsider their booking plans.

Not sure if this is money well spent, or if my wife would agree, but this angry money makes me feel better.



Update Monday: After 72 hours of leaving me on read, Airbnb support replied [with this](https://imgur.com/a/GthQbLH). Does anybody think my host is going to ”approve” this? 😂 

Went to the Thai Police and filed a police report while I'm still in the area. I just want to fire a shot across the bow to this scammer host for trying to ""renegotiate"" after I'd paid.

Update Tuesday:
Airbnb updated me to say my host didn't respond about refunding the unspent nights. They recommend we just use the review feature now. 

Another Tuesday update: The chargeback is filed with my bank. Spent a few hours organizing all of the notes, pictures, and discrepancies from the listing, and writing a letter to explain why I think I'm entitled to a successful dispute. 

I think it will take a while for this to work it's way through the bank networks but I'll keep updating when there's new information.

Airbnb,WSJ: Airbnb to Make Cleaning Fees Clearer on Searches After Customer Complaints,"It's about time.  Let's see how it works when it's rolled out.

>Airbnb to Make Cleaning Fees Clearer on Searches After Customer Complaints The travel company also says it will make predeparture cleaning requirements easier for customers to find earlier in their search  
>  
>After social-media backlash more than a year ago, Airbnb announced a review of its fees.  
>  
>By Allison Pohle  
>  
>Nov. 7, 2022 4:00 am ET  
>  
>The cleaning fees that customers of Airbnb Inc. have long complained about will soon become more apparent early in searches for lodging, the company says.  
>  
>Starting in December, on an undetermined date, the company will allow guests to filter their search results by the total cost of the stay before taxes, Chief Executive Brian Chesky said on Sunday. That means the often-maligned cleaning fees will be among the fees included in the prices customers see.  
>  
>Guests will need to hit a toggle switch to display the total cost of nightly rates and fees, rather than just the nightly rate, which now is often the only cost customers in the U.S. and elsewhere see early in the shopping process. Once a customer selects the feature, the total price will display on maps, wish lists, in itineraries and when searching by price range, Mr. Chesky says.  
>  
>“We want everyone to see it. We want people to turn it on,” he says. The feature will stay turned on as long as the person is logged in, so it doesn’t need to be selected every time, he says.  
>  
>Starting next month, Airbnb will let people search by total price, including all fees before taxes. PHOTO: AIRBNB The change comes after complaints the company heard regarding how pricing is displayed on the platform. After social-media backlash last year, Airbnb announced a review of its fees in May 2021. The company said it aimed to have the review and recommendations in place by Dec. 15 of that year.  
>  
>Asked why the process took nearly another year, Mr. Chesky says that it involved feedback from hosts and guests, and turned into a general review of pricing. The company tested defaulting to displaying the total cost of the stay, a feature already mandated by law in certain countries, including those in the European Union. When Airbnb displayed the total price without any reference to the change, people were confused, he says.  
>  
>“The prices do look more expensive. They don’t know why they’re more expensive and certainly that’s not helpful to business,” he says. He added that Airbnb needed extra time to get the design of the display right. Toggling on and off allows people to become aware of what changes were made in the display, he says.  
>  
>The change is one of a few the company is announcing formally Monday. The total cost of the stay will also factor more heavily into search results, regardless of whether users toggle the total price feature. Listings with better value, determined by price and quality relative to other listings in their area, will rank higher in search results, the company says. This change is live, but will continue to be refined, Mr. Chesky says.  
>  
>In the coming months, hosts will have access to tools to set more variable pricing, including seasonal and weekend discounts, the company says.  
>  
>Early next year, Airbnb also plans to make predeparture requirements related to cleaning easier to find on listings so people can evaluate them before they book, Mr. Chesky says.  
>  
>This also means updating guidelines for hosts on what is a reasonable task, he says. Some requirements, such as turning off lights and locking doors are reasonable, but, others, such as vacuuming and doing laundry, cross a line, he says.  
>  
>“These are chores, and we don’t think that people should have to do unreasonable chores,” Mr. Chesky says.

Airbnb,"Getting ready to set up my own corona virus policy for Air BnB, Booking.com, and direct","  

CORONA VIRUS POLICIES AT DIA BnB

1. Perimeter defense: If you have Corona virus, don’t come. If you suspect you have infection don’t come. If we suspect you are infected, we won’t let you in. We have eliminated all non-essential traffic and guests on the property for the safety of staff and guests.

2. Switching rooms: We reserve rights to have guests switch rooms. All rooms have flooring that is mopped and sanitized in addition to looking great. All rooms have new beds with “bed in a box” technology. All have a 50” Roku television with all streaming services. The Wi-Fi is superfast and generally averages of 100 Mps. We switch rooms to give you the one that has gone the longest period of time without a guest, for safety reasons.

3. Minimum one week stay: We are looking for guests that are going to be here for a little bit. We are about 10 miles away from Denver International Airport and under 5 miles from the junction of three different major highway intersections. We get a ton of overnight visitors numbering in the hundreds each year. We are turning that off to only have longer-term guests.

4. Easiest cancelation policies in the world: In this time of travel during in a freaking pandemic, how can you realistically hold anybody to a commitment? We 100% refund all unused time. We also allow all guests to make sure they are comfortable and feel safe with the accommodations. At the same time, this is a two-way street and we are not guaranteeing a room for you. If you appear to be ill or the situation does not sound right, you will not be let in.

5. No guests without management approval: We are limiting people here to paying customers. All of our guests are here for work-related reasons. Let’s all do our jobs and try to get through this. More people = more interaction = more risks.

6. Maid service: We have always had a maid. She does not clean your room, she does not go into your room. She cleans and sterilizes all the common areas. We follow the Center for Disease Control (CDC) cleaning guidelines.

7. Temperature checking: There is not widely available testing at this time. We do the next best thing of asking questions to determine risk and requiring a temperature check. We are looking for 99.5 and below. If your temperature is higher than this, you will be requested to leave immediately and the unused portion of your stay and deposit will be refunded immediately. Temperature is taken via an infrared thermometer to the forehead.

8. Remote check-in: We have always been set up for remote check-in, but we are making it clearer, simpler, and faster. We can still take cash and we have a procedure for that as well. We also take PayPal, Cash App, and Venmo. We can still use Square as well, but charge a higher processing fee for having to physically touch the card.

9. We handle the challenge of getting supplies: With limited stores open, limited hours, and limited inventory, we handle all of that for you. We have also opened an onsite convenience store which includes some breakfast items. These are not meant as profit centers, merely trying to keep guests from leaving to pick up soda, candy bars, and cigarettes. We even provide all movie channels and streaming platforms.",0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/g0wlpa/getting_ready_to_set_up_my_own_corona_virus/,2020-04-14 01:55:03,Booking.com
Airbnb,I will never use Airbnb again (Nightmare Guest and horrible customer service),"I will start by saying that I’ve been hosting on airbnb for 3.5 years and have a 90 reviews with a 4.90 star rating. My property has two homes on one lot and I live in the small front unit while the Airbnb home is in a nice private lot behind my home. It was a great ride but airbnbs customer service is a joke these days and will not do anything to help the host, even when they are threatened from a guest. 

Here’s the story:

I received a last minute instant-booking Monday at 6 pm and my cleaners car broke down earlier and communicated that they’d be really late (usually cleanings are completed by 3 pm) 

I let the guest know about the situation and communicated that my wife and I will be cleaning the home to have it ready by 8 pm for the guest (We cleaned the home for a whole year before hiring professional cleaners). 

I offered a $100 credit towards their stay and let them know if that wasn’t enough, they are able to cancel due to the inconvenience. 

I didn’t receive a message back on Airbnb so I decided to call the gentlemen to alert him in case he wasn’t aware of the situation, but the phone number is disconnected. I sent a text message anyways so I had proof that I tried reaching out in different ways. 

I made sure to communicate when we were nearing completion and sent a message on Airbnb at 8 pm alerting the guest that the home was ready. 

I still didn’t receive a response so I tried calling a few more times, but left it alone since it was late. 

The next morning rolls by and still no guest.

Odd. 

I thought it was potentially a company that booked it since I’ve had a few past guests miss the first night. 

Next day at 11:30 am, the guest sent a disturbing and scary message. 

“I need cancellation I need my money Place back in my account all I need another place of my choice with a week's extension for free for the hassle and the b******* for sleeping on the streets with my kids the whole nine yards last night it was b******* I've never been through this before with you guys I need to know something now. 

I need to know the f****** proper address and yes I would like at least two to three days of extra for the f****** b******* that we had to go through you don't understand me and my kids were sleeping in the truck on the side of the road in the neighborhood we have no no nothing about okay that's not too much to ask for and I need the address that just I got was 845 okay there was no 845 we walked all over the damn place we even ask people on the street no one knew what was that we couldn't find it otherwise I want my full refund. 

So what are we doing I'm sitting here waiting for some kind of answer I'm tired of waiting I'm tired of all this s*** I need to know something now.”

My wife and I instantly felt scared and threatened as we had to host this crazy guy for 5 nights. 

Those message came from nowhere and we instantly wanted to cancel to get this guy away. We attempted to cancel but airbnb doesn’t allow us to cancel during a stay. So I called customer service and my god…. 

I spoke to 10 different airbnb specialists (I’m not kidding) to have this guy’s booking canceled but they said that they’d investigate and get back to me in a hour or two. 

Every single agent said the same exact thing for the next 4 days. I have screenshots of everything. 

The crazy guy then roamed my entire property knocking on my own private home, my windows, and into my backyard to find us.

My wife and I have never felt more scared in our entire lives. 

I told airbnb to contact him and let him know that he’ll get his money back and to leave my property right away. They never contacted him. 

I messaged him that he is no longer allowed on the property and he needs to call airbnb. If he started acting more threatening, I was going to call the police. 

There’s a lot more to this story but In a nutshell:

Airbnb did nothing to resolve it as he continued to send disturbing messages to me via airbnb message, text and a voicemail from a random number. Airbnb finally called me on the last night asking if I can cancel and give the money back to the guest… on the last night. Oh, and I would lose super host status for canceling. 

They literally told me that it is what it is and we’re sorry. 

I let them know that I’ll be exposing their terrible airbnb protocols in order to change their business model to help protect and assist hosts and future guests from any threatening or scary situations. They apologized in the most unauthentic way and said can we help you with anything else? 

I hung up. 

Please be safe everyone. Airbnb is NOTHING like before and if you have any issues, you’ll get screwed. 

I’m using VRBO and Booking.com until I can rent the home out.

I was hit by one of the bullets in the back of the neck, less than an inch from being dead or paralyzed. AirBnb did not allow us to leave a review.","Trying this again since my post was removed for some reason.  The intent of this post is to give people a heads up to avoid properties like the one I stayed at and to share our experience with AirBnB.

I removed the address and the link to the property this go around.  To clarify, I don't have issue with the property being relisted.  My frustration is that we were not afforded an opportunity to leave a review.  In other words, the host or AirBnb deleted the listing prior to us being able to leave a review and have since relisted it, effectively covering up a relevant experience per AirBnb's review policy.

My good friend booked an AirBnB for a mutual friend's bachelor party and then the title happened.  
The DropBox link below is my friend's write up of the experience (trigger warning, gunshot violence). TLDR: 4.72/5 star AirBnB is in one of the highest crime neighborhoods in Nashville, there was a drive by outside and I was shot.

AirBnB denied us the ability to leave a review.  Guests should be aware of the danger they are exposed to at properties like this. I was hesitant to even post this to avoid going through this again but this behavior is not right and a prime example of how AirBnB continues to prioritize money over guest safety. Passing this on in hopes that it may prevent someone from going through something similar. If anyone has insight in to what we can do further to inform Nashville visitors, please DM me.

Well last night at 9:30pm I answer a call *""This is Agent Cody with the Drug Enforcement Administration, we're conducting a Narcotics Search Warrant at your condo""*. The guests refused to answer the door so they kicked it in, arrested 3-people for distribution of Fentanyl, searched the place for 3hrs and found thousands of Fentanyl pills, other opioids, bags of cash, 2 handguns (including pills flushed down the toilet which the police removed to fish out the drain.

I reached out to Airbnb this morning and have a dedicated agent, they agreed to cover all expenses for repairs and cleanup, re-furnishing and resupplying, told me to send them receipts for each thing and they will deposit it into my account.

Hopefully Airbnb actually does everything they agreed to do, but we'll see.

Just wondering if anyone has had any experience in cancelling a guest on booking. com. We were originally unaware that as a host you could not cancel a guest under any circumstance of which I find quite disturbing. As such, we are wanting to remove our property from the platform.

Airbnb,Anyone use Booking.com? Technical Question,"Preface this by saying that issues like this are part of the reason I only host on Airbnb instead of on multiple sites!  

I don't use Booking, but a friend hosts her house through it (lists it on several sites) and I've helped her with the other sites a couple of times but I'm stumped here.  She uses Lodgify as a channel manager and uses cleaning fees.  Lodgify told her that she can't add a cleaning fee to reservations made on Booking through Lodgify, but that the cleaning fee has to be added on the booking listing details.  The phrasing on the booking side of it is confusing (and I'm an experienced Airbnb host) - you have to say whether the cleaning charge is included in the booking, but a lot of their charges seem like you can add them but have to charge the guest cash in person?  It's not clear how to add it as an extra to the nightly charge (even after having read a couple of help articles).

Airbnb,Airbnb defrauded me and abused me and left me on the street [UK],"Okay so I came to the UK for the weekend to watch the LoL world finals.

I booked a flat via airbnb. I was supposed to receive the check in pin for the keybox on the day of the checkin, the pin never came. I asked the host what is going on, and he proceeded to tell me he will be refusing to host me due to apparent “bed bugs”

Picture 1:

https://x.com/starlightapm/status/1852383866297647518?s=46

Ok no issue, airbnb told me they will give me 30 dollar as compensation and to look for a hotel. End of the line.

I found this ridiculous so i posted the tweet above that garnered about 20,000 impressions.

At this point someone from “senior leadership” reached out to me urgently saying they will be compensated me up to 500 USD a night and i can send them a listing to book via airbnb so they will generate a specific coupon

https://x.com/starlightapm/status/1852444188077392132?s=46

Ok finally I had a decent place booked near the event venue for tomorrow, i thought everything will be going well. However 3 hours later airbnb proceeded to tell me they are cancelled my ENTIRE account for apparently planning to host  an “unauthorized party” in the same airbnb my case worker booked for me. Completely removing my access to the support tickets and my account. Only leaving me with a small form to “plead” my case which they will make a decision in 7 days. Now even if i call their support they tell me they cant do anything as their “designated “ team is the only one that has access to my account 

https://x.com/starlightapm/status/1852547353401581744?s=46

Airbnb,"Yet again, Airbnb refusing to honor their extenuating circumstances policy","I just arrived in France and as most people know, there is horrible rioting and looting going on all over. We were supposed to arrive in Paris and take the train to Lyon today, but our Airbnb was literally one block away from a protest location that was deemed illegal, so we knew there would be trouble. We did not feel comfortable arriving at 8 PM right when this protest was scheduled. In the end, the protesters had tear gas released on them and the whole night was filled with rioting, fireworks being shot at police, looting, etc. 

I posted to Reddit to ask people’s advice and everyone suggested we not stay right in this area. It’s too dangerous and unclear right now. If we stayed there, we’d have to shut ourselves in all evening. 

I contacted Airbnb saying I had a safety issue. They never replied through the app. They just closed the case. When we landed in Paris, I called them and the agent is telling me that this does not qualify as an extenuating circumstance despite the fact that rioting and civil unrest are in the policy:

“Military actions and other hostilities. Acts of war, hostilities, invasions, civil war, terrorism, explosions, bombings, rebellions, riots, insurrection, civil disorder, and civil unrest.”

The agent tried to tell me that there’s no military action, so it doesn’t count. Bullshit. That is not how this is written. Now he’s telling me there is no more rioting in Lyon as if they know that. Are we supposed to just assume it’ll all be ok tonight and the next few days? No one knows what’s going to happen. 

I ended up canceling the booking for a measly $107 back on a $455 reservation. They’re telling me it’s up to the listing owner to decide if I can get the rest back. I’m so frustrated. We’ve already had to spend hundreds more on a room in Paris for the night, plus we have to figure out a new booking plan for the next few days.

Airbnb,I'm suing AirBnB and I'm telling you why and how in case you need to do the same [Spain],"I have booked a place in Spain to spend a week with my family in January next year for just under €1,000.

After a long back and forth about which place to choose, I decide on one that looks good to accommodate the family. Just as I click and proceed with the payment, I receive the automatic confirmation that the booking has been accepted.

Delighted I check the booking and I see ""No pets allowed"" which triggered... my mum has a small dog, well behaved but a pet at the end of the day so I immediately texted the host (an agency) stating that if they could make an exception for a well behaved dog or would they mind processing the full refund as I made a mistake and I communicated it to them immediately (no loss to anyone).

Their reply the next day was ""No pets allowed and therefore we cannot process the refund"", no negotiation, no flexibility, no further explanation despite my subsequent messages. They are keeping more than €500 in case I want to cancel, which I find completely unacceptable.

My actions from here:

1. **Opened a case with support** which was a complete waste of time.

**Result**: 2 days back and forth explaining the case to no help and supporting the host's decision with ""Host's policy and we can't do anything as we respect our community"". Apparently they respect their community but not their customers.

2. **Claim via Paypal** to see if there is more sense there as they won't be able to provide the service  
Result: (I will update here when they come back to me)

3. **Take this matter to** [Facua](https://facua.org/whoweare/) to understand what legal actions we can take\*\*.\*\* I am member of this organisation and they have been proved very useful as I am in court with Ryanair as well and so far so good.  
Result: I will update this as it comes.

Additional data:  
The host is a company called Novasol and apparently they are pretty bad given their [trust pilot](https://ie.trustpilot.com/review/www.novasol.com) and [google reviews](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Novasol+AS/@36.6855487,-5.0407102,9z/data=!3m1!5s0xd72f79c71ec695b:0x21f70b2cb43bbaa9!4m12!1m2!2m1!1snovasol!3m8!1s0xd72f796b9d726f1:0xff51c162990860ed!8m2!3d36.71377!4d-4.4343307!9m1!1b1!15sCgdub3Zhc29skgEQY29ycG9yYXRlX29mZmljZeABAA!16s%2Fg%2F11d_7yjt95?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).

  
EDIT: for those siding with ""read the terms and conditions"". California has regulated this already:  
24-hour free cancellation period for reservations in California

When you're booking a stay in California at least 72 hours before check-in, you'll have 24 hours to cancel for a full refund. We're doing this to comply with California law and to improve the booking experience.

Note: You may have more than 24 hours to cancel for a full refund, depending on your host’s cancellation policy.",0,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1ggijr4/im_suing_airbnb_and_im_telling_you_why_and_how_in/,2024-10-31 16:23:45,Booking.com

Airbnb,Unfair bad review. Guest expected things never offered [USA],"I have a couple small-ish units in a weekend heavy tourist town.  One of them is your typical hotel room sized with a kitchenette, cozy reading/TV chair/corner, and a full bath.  My listing is very clear on the size and I specify every single amenity.  My photos are not professional and do not use wide angle lenses, except for one which is able to capture basically the entire room (it's more fisheye and clearly not to scale).  What you see is exactly what you get.  I have all 5 star, glowing, reviews except this new one which is 2.  

Their biggest gripe is that they were down there for a quasi family reunion and were ""distraught"" that they were unable to cook and have a large family dinner because the kitchen didn't have a stove, oven, and full cookware.  No where in my listing does it mention I have any of those and my pictures are not ambiguous or misleading.  Here's a picture of the kitchenette and the list of amenities.. 

[kitchenette Pic](https://i.imgur.com/sBFvXAU.jpeg)

[Kitchen Amenities in Listing](https://i.imgur.com/hHu5ltB.jpeg)

They also complained that people could see through the front door glass if they wanted to and they felt EXTREMELY unsafe because of it.  The glass is a narrow strip with old stained/bubble glass which also has a frosting film on the inside.  It's so frosted that even if you put your hand up against it you wouldn't be able to see the hand from the other side.  

Outside of that the rest of their review was very good andatched the general sentiment of all my other ones.  Hell, had they reached out to me I would have given them access to my full sized unit which has everything they wanted, on the top floor (I don't rent that space).

I reached out to Airbnb to try and have the review removed.  The rep was sympathetic and seemed to agree with my points.  It'd be like booking a place that has no pool then giving it a 1 star review because it had no pool.  That seems spiteful and not on good faith, do e simply to harm the host.  I provided pictures of everything and they said I'd hear back in a couple days. 

A day later I got a response that nothing on the review violated their terms and they would not remove it. 

It sucks because I worked really hard to build a unique space and Im a very accommodating and involved host.  This one 2 star, even weighed against all the 5s brings down my score. It's not enough to remove me as a super host but what if I get another one or two in the future?  It's takes so many 5 stars too offset a single bad review.  My place is normally in the top 1-3 results when you search in the town and it's kept me very booked.  I don't want to lose that. 

Is there anything I can do?  Should I keep calling over and over hoping that they get exasperated and remove the review? ",0,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1fhr0oc/unfair_bad_review_guest_expected_things_never/,2024-09-15 23:59:03,Booking.com

It’s the raining season right now and have been traveling and all the pools have been freezing. I Booked this place specifically for the “jacuzzi” when check in. There  is no jacuzzi just a cold pool connected to a smaller cold pool. I messaged and ask where is the jacuzzi because the one in the picture is just a 2 ft deep freezing kiddy pool. She says it there and then when I pressed the matter further, she’s saws we call that a jacuzzi and that she didn’t know that meat warm/hot water. I sent her a screen shot of what it says if you google “what is a jacuzzi” 

How could she have 77 reviews and no one mention that there was no jacuzzi or hot tub?

Airbnb,AirBnB is refusing to honor their Extenuating Circumstances policy,"I scheduled a trip to Paris with my family (wife + 2 kids) for March 9 - 16. Today is March 8th. We woke up to this news.

Riots and civil unrest.

To be clear, I stand with the people of Paris. I take no issue with the strike. However, I have young children and I'd rather not be in Paris while this is going on.

This morning, I requested a refund from the host. They refused. I then requested a refund from AirBnB. I pointed out their extenuating circumstances policy, which I have pasted below. It is available for all to see at [https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1320](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1320).

From the policy:

""This Extenuating Circumstances Policy explains how cancellations are handled when unforeseen events beyond your control arise after booking and make it impracticable or illegal to complete your reservation. This Policy applies to reservations for both accommodations and Experiences.

**When this Policy allows for cancellation, it controls and takes precedence over the reservation’s** [**cancellation policy**](https://www.airbnb.com/home/cancellation_policies)**. Guests that are impacted by an event covered by this Policy can cancel their reservation and receive, depending on the circumstances, a cash refund, travel credit, and/or other consideration.** Hosts that are impacted by an event covered by this Policy can cancel [without adverse consequences](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/990/as-a-host-what-penalties-apply-if-i-cancel-a-reservation-for-a-stay), but, depending on the circumstances, their calendars may be blocked for the dates of the cancelled reservation.""

The above text clearly states that ""this Policy allows for cancellation, it controls and takes precedence over the reservation’s [cancellation policy](https://www.airbnb.com/home/cancellation_policies).""  and ""Guests that are impacted by an event covered by this Policy can cancel their reservation and receive, depending on the circumstances, a cash refund, travel credit, and/or other consideration.""

Among the events covered are the following:

""Military actions and other hostilities. Acts of war, hostilities, invasions, civil war, terrorism, explosions, bombings, rebellions, **riots**, insurrection, **civil disorder**, and **civil unrest**.""

I spent over 9 hours of chats and calls trying to get AirBnB to do the right thing and follow their own policy.

7 minutes after posting a link to this Reddit post to my AirBnB chat thread, I got a full refund.

The new price: $10,112.21

The host didn't even reach out or contact us at all... was only notified by AirBnB support.

FWIW, a hotel has never cancelled on me to raise the price 3x

\---

EDIT:

I think the lesson to be learned here is that Instant Bookings from AirBnB aren't fully protected, as the host has 3 Instant Bookings a year they can cancel without penalty. If this was a regular booking, AirBnB policy (I believe) is to disallow the host from relisting the property during the dates they cancelled on you.

I think the problem here is that the host waited 4 months to cancel their Instant Booking, which doesn't make sense to me. Instant Booking policies should probably turn into regular booking policies after 1 month from the booking date. It doesn't seem right that they can use the Instant Booking policies after 4 months from the reservation.

Also AirBnB could do a better job at making it clear that you're less protected as a guest when doing Instant Bookings, below support article for Instant Book only mentions the positives, none of the negatives. Only the host version of the instant book feature really explains the power they have over bookings.

Host said price is now increased x3.8 times. and requests that I cancel the booking as they wont be able to host me with price that I paid for my booking.

I proceed to cancellation page and I notice Airbnb is showing me $0 will be refunded to me, since check-in is less than 24 hours. I click on 'Host asked me to cancel' button and Airbnb show a message saying I need to ask host to cancel it by themselves. I click on the button and it opens a page to check with host. so I messaged host to cancel, host said they are looking at how to cancel....

After few hours, host still did not cancel. I contact Airbnb support. Airbnb said my booking is under flexible cancellation and I should be able to cancel without issue and get refund. I screenshot the page that it show $0 will be refunded. Support said sorry for confusion, and said I am correct, since booking is for tomorrow, I cannot cancel it. They said they will ask host to cancel.

Meanwhile, I booked a place for me and my family to stay via [booking.com](https://booking.com). so that we don't be homeless.

Check-in day arrived and I ask Airbnb support for an update. This time another chat agent replied and they said they are still waiting for host to proceed with cancellation. I told them how long more I should wait, Airbnb support said it all depends on the host.

I argue with them that I am protected via Rebooking and Refund Policy as well as AirCover for checkin guarantee.

Checkout day come, I asked for an update. Again this time, another chat agent replied, Airbnb support replied: ""I would like to set a proper expectation, that will depend on your Host discretion if they will give you a full refund."", ""As we check, the reservation is not cancelled yet"", ""Inform your host that he needs to cancel your reservation on there end and its is not cancelled anymore on our system"" (this is exact copy paste of support reply, including grammar mistakes, so at least I know support is not a robot...)

Now one day after checkout day, Airbnb email me and asked me to leave a review for my stay that I never stood.

Is AirCover just for decoration? Why airbnb is not offering any help? What are chances that I can get a refund? and why should I take so much effort to get my refund, should support just process it for me? why they keep ask me to ask host to cancel it knowing host won’t cancel (likely to avoid cancellation penalty)

Airbnb,"Bugs under the bed, Airbnb refuses to give a refund","I booked an Airbnb for myself, spouse and in-laws. We checked in tonight, dropped off our bags and left for dinner. Upon returning and getting ready for bed we found a couple of dead bugs on the bed. No biggie - it’s an older house and it’s summer in the south. I brushed them off and kept going. My wife lifted her pillow and found a third bug, this one moving. 

At this point we lifted the mattress and discovered dozens, if not hundreds of bugs on the bed frame. Being late at night we took pictures and videos, booked the nearest reasonably priced hotel and got the hell out of there. 

The host is refusing the give us a refund saying that if we’d asked he had another property nearby he could have offered. He also said that if we canceled and he can rebook the place he’d consider a refund. Both those options sound ridiculous to me -
1.	Why would I trust any other place doesn’t have the same issues?
2.	I’ll get my money back if he can get someone else to pay to sleep in a bug infested bed? 

Airbnb tells me that bugs aren’t a covered reason for a refund because they’re not considered dangerous to humans which is also absurd. 

At this point I’ve told Airbnb that I refuse to cancel or move to another of the hosts properties. What methods are available to me to get a refund? I’ve attached some pictures but beware if you’re squeamish

Airbnb,what would you do? host wants us to pay $57 for new sheets or book another stay for minor menstrual stain [USA],"
hello just wanted to see how this situation would be handled from a host or other guests perspective

just finished a 2 night stay and everything was good 

however, being a human with a uterus-i got my period and left minor stains on the white sheets. obviously not intentional, and i’m talking 3 *drops* of blood in a small area-nothing crazy.

however this happened the morning of checking out, we made sure to follow all house rules and checking out/cleaning policies and left the place clean. didnt really have much time or the products to deal with the stains but i did just carefully blot them with cold water and paper towel which definitely helped fade them and blot the stain, but didnt completely remove it. i was definitely embarassed and didnt want to stain the sheets. 

host kindly messaged us this morning before checkout and i let them know everything was great and informed them about the stain as a courtesy.
they responded asking if i could bleach it at a laundromat or if we would replace the sheets? mind you this was 30mins before the set checkout time and we definitely were not going to go to laundromat when we had a 7 hour drive to do. 
ultimately imo the stain is minor and is definitely treatable. ive gotten hundreds of blood stains out of many fabrics in my lifetime. 

i let them know this this all and mentioned that’s something that should be covered by a cleaning fee but i didnt realize they didnt charge for one, however they don’t have any policies stating anything about replacing soiled linens or something along those lines.

host sent pictures, which i’m glad they did because to me these pictures prove the stains are minor. they have been nice and understanding people but they want it replaced without even trying to wash/treat the sheets due to past experiences and becuase of their septic tank... anyways they offered us to either pay $57 for new sheets or book another stay with them.

i will attatch pics of sheets and convo:

https://imgur.com/a/k2jM4i2

the hosts and stay were great and they asked more than once for 5 stars, but this situation has left me feeling uncomfortable and not knowing how to move forward 

as a host or guest what would you do in this situation?

tldr: left minor faded menstrual blood stains on sheets and hosts wants us to pay $57 for new sheets or book another stay with them

edit: i know this is 10 days later but thank you to everyone who commented!!! i really was just curious to see how other people would handle this and i feel validated by the majority and especially by the hosts that agree the situation was handled poorly and to those who disagree i respect your differences! i agree its gross to deal with any bodily functions and any type of stains in general but this sort of situation common for this industry. i know everyone has their own protocol so i just wanted some outside perspectives, thank u kindly :)

Airbnb,Unit owner wants to cancel my reservation made to photograph the solar eclipse. I reserved it 20 months ago[USA],"I am an astrophotographer who reserved a large Airbnb in Marble Falls,Texas to shoot the total solar eclipse on April 8th of this year. I've invited my extended family and so far there are 12 of us who will be coming, many of whom have already purchased flights into Austin and rental cars. I made the reservation on the very first available date which was April 8, 2022. If you tried to book a comparable home now it would be more than triple the cost because so many people are making last minute plans. 

Today I was told by the unit's management company - [Horseshoe Bay Living](https://www.horseshoebayliving.com) \- that the unit owner is no longer doing short-term rentals and that they were going to cancel my reservation.  This is devastating news. I suspect the owner now realizes he/she can get a lot more money simply renting it on their own. 

Horseshoe Bay Living said they were allowed to cancel per their lease which they sent me today, however it was the first time I've seen it and it was unsigned. All of my dealings were directly with Airbnb. The company says they will try to find something comparable in quality and price, but a quick glance at Airbnb shows that that is highly unlikely. 

This is the very first time I've rented an Airbnb and could sure use some help.

Thank you

Airbnb,BIG UPDATE. I am furious.,"Original post here:

My girlfriends and I find a place with everything we're looking for. $1440 for the weekend, but not so bad with the 20% off coupon support mentioned.

I contact support to cancel the first booking with the broken hot tub. Get my refund, and the 20% coupon. Only to find out the coupon isn't 20% off the value of my next stay, as I understood, but 20% of the value of the first stay. Worse still, because I hadn't been charged the full amount yet, my 20% credit was based on my $162 deposit. I have a coupon for a measly $32, and another ""rebooking"" coupon for $41, totalling $73, LESS than what the hosts had offered me as a discount.

I call Myra (my assigned customer support agent) and am nearly in tears. Now we've cancelled our booking and can't afford the new place, since we're not getting the 20% off they had mentioned. I tell her I never would have cancelled the first stay if I'd known the credit from AirBnB was going to be 20% based on my first stay, let alone on the DEPOSIT of the first stay. It makes no sense. So, If I had paid in full last August instead of selecting the ""pay later"" option, my 20% credit would be $162?

She's going to talk to her manager to ""approve"" my request, which means they could also very well deny it. They could very well call it a day with my $32 credit (+$41). I'm livid. I don't know what to do.

&#x200B;

**FINAL UPDATE:** We got approved for the full 20% off credit based on $811, totalling $162 off my next stay. Still not the best situation, as we've cancelled our first stay and have a request in for the more expensive place, which may or may not be approved.

This has been stress inducing. I got my friend to put in a request for the first place we cancelled since I could see it on my map again. She did and ended up getting the confirmation, so at the very least, we can still go to the first place (no working hot tub). 

We’ll see what happens. People aren’t as friendly on this post as they were my first, but I understand how this can all come across as entitled. Being able to afford a weekend by the lake with your closest friends is a privilege not everyone gets, and a trip we’ve been saving up for all year.

Airbnb,Traumatized - accused of $9k in damages - do you think cleaners are taking advantage of out-of-town hosts? [USA],"I think our last host is being taken advantage of by the boots-on-the-ground team, and I'm wondering if this is something that is starting to become more common. 

The cleaning company she hired seemed to know how to push buttons to get her raging quickly. The host claimed we damaged 2 couches and caused tons of cleaning fees because of how filthy we were. When she made the claim, I could see all the screenshots between her and the cleaner. She was making such ridiculous claims.  This is a question and-vent post now.

We stayed on a property in Estes Valley for a month and had a great time as a family.  

Several red flags were flying. I knew I should have listened to them as they went up, but we were very excited to stay together as a family and didn't want to jeopardize our vacation.

1. A month after we booked, we were asked for an additional fee. They claimed that their septic tank would need to be drained while we were there and asked us to pay half the price. 

2. Asked to take communication off app 3 days before stay to talk on the phone. She was worried about her couches because of the kids. I felt that she may have been a bit neurotic at this point because who has an Airbnb that houses 7 people and a crib for a baby and doesn't prepare for the fact that there are kids staying? However, when I arrived, the couches looked VERY WORN. I should have taken pictures at the time, but I didn't. It came back to get me. 

3. Asked us to do hot tub maintenance after the fact, meaning balancing the chemicals. 

4. After I spoke with her, I felt like we had to be VERY CAREFUL because I was worried about what she'd do or say. I ended up repairing her washer, which was leaking when we arrived because I was worried she was going to blame us for it. 

5. She asked me to crawl under her house and open the septic tank to check if it was full halfway through the stay. I didn't know what to do but said ok, so I did it. 

6. Too cheap to pay for trash pickup in the area - Required us to go 25 minutes into town to drop off trash at $20 a visit. 

7. Unfamiliar with the area, there was no cell service for 20 minutes in either direction nor was there a landline for us. One day, the power was knocked out because of the wind, and we had no way to communicate with anyone. She clearly didn't know the property. 

8. According to a neighbor who had never seen her before our stay, she purchased the property sight unseen. She used the same images in the listing that she used when she bought the house. 

9. The house had many quirks, as do many Airbnbs, and we didn't want to nitpick, so we handled issues as they came up and did our best.

10. she listted it for sale before we checked in

After we checked out, she became belligerent with me via message, sending me images of the clean laundry we piled up on the table and couch, saying we trashed the home and ruined her hot tub. The tone was disrespectful, so I told her I would be more comfortable discussing anything further on the app. 

The next day, I received a $9k reimbursement claim from her. I was flabbergasted because we went the extra mile to be good guests. I truly believe most of the issues from her claim come from an unscrupulous and incompetent cleaning team (i saw another post that claimed the whole house smelled like vomit). Not only did this cleaning team take advantage of her, she has other vendors that I think are too. The septic tank company cleaned out the septic tank twice while we (a family of 8) were there for a month. Anyone that knows septic systems knows that's insane. The hot tub company that came and drained and filled the tub charged her $500. We used it a handful of times while were were there because it was too hot outside to be enjoyable. We weren't soaking ourselves in dirt then getting in and it definitely didn't look like that when we last used it. 

Anyway, Here's my response to Airbnb resolutions team:   
[https://imgur.com/a/yKbiRot](https://imgur.com/a/yKbiRot)

I'm not perfect, but after scrolling through this and the Airbnb host subs, I made every effort to be a good guest. Putting this out there is helping me let go of it. I've canceled my account. I've left my review. I'm cooperating with the resolutions team. That said, there must be a few things that service providers know will get them more money if they say to the host. 

Thanks for listening

Airbnb,Asked to pay security deposit via an external hyperlink. What should I do? [USA],"I booked a cabin via AirBnB for a few days. It looks like the owners have 4 or 5 cabins and have their own little LLC or something (the host's email address is something like firstname_lastname@cabinrentalcompany.com). 

After booking I got a message from the host with the following information:

""You will be required to sign a rental agreement as well as provide information for a security deposit as stated in the listing  prior to staying at the cabin. The security deposit is a fully refundable hold that will be released 72 hours after check out pending no damages. You will NOT receive access to the property or check in instructions unless both the security deposit form and rental agreement are completed. Please take a minute to click on the following link, input your information, and sign. If the link does not work, please copy and paste the URL below into your browser."" (Then there was a hyperlink to some website that wants me to enter my credit card info and other info).


After reading through AirBnB's policy, it looks like hosts are not allowed to solicit security deposits outside of the AirBnB app (the text below is from AirBnB's help center article concerning security deposits).

""Hosts aren’t allowed to charge guests a security deposit through our Resolution Center or outside the Airbnb platform. Instead, we inform guests at the time of booking that their payment method may be charged if they cause damage during a stay.  There is one exception: Hosts who manage their listings with API-connected software can set a security deposit using our offline fees feature. If a Host has done this, the deposit requirements will be clearly communicated during the booking process.""


There was definitely no security deposit requirements included in the booking process, the only time a security deposit is mentioned was in the listing and in the message I received afterwards from the host. 

I'm not opposed to paying a security deposit, but I don't trust an external link; and if it turns out there are any damages or claims by the host, AirBnB can just charge my credit card that I booked the cabin with, right? 

What do I do? 



****UPDATE****

After some back and forth messages with the host, I cancelled the reservation and reported them to Airbnb for trying to charge guests money outside of the Airbnb platform. 



For those curious, here is the message exchange I had with the host:

----------
Me: Hi (host)! Looking forward to the trip! However, it's my understanding that Airbnb policy is that all transactions must be done through the Airbnb platform. Is that correct? 

I really don't feel comfortable entering my credit card info via a 3rd party link that takes me outside of Airbnb. 

Any potential damages done to the property can be claimed through Airbnb and charged to the credit card we used to book your cabin (although I've been using Airbnb for years and never been charged damages or paid a security deposit before). 

Just wondering if we are still able to book and stay in the cabin without using the external security deposit website? Please let me know! 

----------
Host: Hi (guest)! You are correct, the only exception is software connected hosts such as ourselves. That basically means Airbnb has vetted the software we use and has deemed it trustworthy.  I have attached a screenshot of the policy so you can check it out! 
(They included a screenshot but I'll paste the text below) 
""SECURITY DEPOSIT
Hosts aren't allowed to charge guests a security deposit through our Resolution Center or outside the Airbnb platform. Instead, we inform guests at the time of booking that their payment method may be charged if they cause damage during a stay.
There is one exception: Hosts who manage their listings with API-
connected software can set a security deposit using our offline fees feature. If a Host has done this, the deposit requirements will be clearly
communicated during the booking process.""

----------
Me: I read that policy and unfortunately you do not fall under that exception. If your software was API connected, then the security deposit would have been included in the payment process within the Airbnb platform at the time of booking. Sending a hyperlink in a message AFTER the booking process is not API connected at all (I'm a software engineer). 

API connected software would mean that you have your own booking software (like a hotel or resort, etc) and your software ""talks"" to the Airbnb software during the booking process to share information (including payment information). 

I'm very weary of any externally provided links like the one you sent me. At best, it's another form of payment outside of the Airbnb platform (which is against Airbnb policy). At worst, you now have my credit card info and can do whatever you want with it.  And AirBnB can't cover me or help me because I gave it to you voluntarily via a source that was outside of Airbnb's platform. 

The security deposit isn't really necessary anyways, because if you really needed to, you could file a damage claim through Airbnb and I would be forced to pay with the credit card that I booked your cabin with. 

We would really like to continue with this booking and utilize your cabin.  Can we do that without paying an external security deposit? 

----------
Host: I completely understand. Our booking software does fall in fact fall under Airbnb’s list of approved API connections although your point about the specifics of the connection may be valid (I am not an engineer). However we do list the requirement for the security deposit in the house rules as instructed by Airbnb so it is disclosed prior to booking. I completely understand your hesitancy and you’re well within your booking window to cancel for a full refund. Let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Airbnb,Help! Airbnb is scamming me,"So two days ago I was looking to block off multiple days for my stay. I was just browsing the app comparing different airbnbs. I searched using dates that were around the time i intended to stay which was 5 days but i searched for a 10 day window. 

I found one listing and I wanted to ask the host a question about the unit. The airbnb app is somewhat confusing because it doesnt tell you the total until you click reserve and I didnt see contact host option (i guess i missed it).  I clicked reserve to see the price of the cleaning fee. Below that I saw a message box to contact the host. I figured I could type my question here. I couldnt find that option anywhere so i wrote my message and clicked send. Only i mistakenly booked the listing. I then canceled right away receiving only 4% back. What the heck?!The total was $4,400.00! 

 Literally one minute later i called airbnb to report the mistake (8:28am was the mistake. My support ticket was 8:29am)

They said they would handle it and get my money back. A full day went by. The next day they said they cannot reach the host and it would take another day. I wondered why are they reaching the host? This was an error I made in the app. The day after they said the host can offer only 50% refund. Wait what?! I was expecting a full refund. Airbnb said because it was instant booking there was nothing that could be done about. So not only did I lose a couple thousand bucks those dates are now taken so I cant even use it the days I intended.

I feel like I got scammed. I just dont understand how a real company like airbnb doesnt have mechanisms in place to prevent this especially when I tried resolving it 1 minute later. Im really depressed about this. I really needed that money for this trip. Airbnb scammed me, pure and simple.

NEW UPDATE!
So the host responded. They responded to my message asking for a refund. Its weird they didnt even acknowledge the refund. Just for me to book new dates. NOW he says the real address is 5 miles from where its on the map. I took screenshots of the map and this fact. Im hoping airbnb rectifies this but they still have the record me saying i screwed up. 

Whats my next move? 5 miles is a lot

Airbnb,Why do hosts think this is acceptable? [USA],"# Was in the Columbus Ohio area and needed a quick stay 1 night before getting on road in the morning. Booked this place and the sheets and pillows was filthy. Dirt and Yellow stains on the sheets. Yellow stains on the pillows. Sofa pillows stunk like piss. Shower head had crud in it and faint black ring around tub. We had to wash the sheets and use our own store bought pillows! And the kicker.... if it wasnt longer than a 4 day stay, we could not use the washer and dryer........ No smoking signs posted everywhere in the Airbnb but it clearly smelled like someone had been smoking in there and there was cleaning products and spray covering the smell up.

The place where people rest their head, the bed, should be clean. Unacceptable. And to think the place had good reviews with some negative sprinkled about with the same concerns I had. I think most guest don't bother checking thoroughly.  Since we got there around 6 PM, we cleaned what we can and left 9 in the morning. If it wasnt we were so tired, we would of went to a hotel. 

Edit....

Host stated my review was false and Airbnb took the review down. Despite me messaging him with the concerns. I opened up an escalation with customer service to provide my photos and videos. These filthy hosts may get over other guests but not me. You will be exposed.

Airbnb,Dodged a bullet with a someone trying to book today [USA],"I had a lady reach out and try to book today (8 year old account, no bookings). We live in an area that sees a wide-range of ages, and some of our favorite guests have been older. This one asked for help booking and chalked it up to being an ""old hippy from San Diego.""  I had a couple personal days marked out on the calendar between some longer bookings so she wasn't able to book two days back-to-back . I decided to offer either blocked date to expand her week day trip to two days mid-week. I sent her the total for her booking, including the dog fee ($40) and cleaning fee ($25) rounded down $2 to be $325 for 2 weeknights as a special offer so she could just press accept and not have to walk her through the steps. She then went on to accuse me of being a scammer committing fraud and that I raised the prices on her and to go back to MAGAT land where my profile mentions I'm from (Las Vegas). I bit my tongue, wanting to explain to her why she was wrong, but she just kept sending more mean messages to me and decided she wasn't going to be worth the hassles.

Airbnb,Unsafe Host at Long-Term Stay in Manhattan [USA],"TL;DR: My host was a(n easily) confirmed sexual predator and con artist. After explaining the situation to multiple Airbnb employees over two days and sending documentation to this effect, I received a message from Airbnb support saying that the host had refused to cancel my stay, and that they were “bound to abide by certain regulations.” After I replied to that post, Airbnb’s response was that “If both of you are unable to reach an agreement with my help, I will then have to make a decision.” I received another reply that I’ve just had a chance to respond to, but as far as I can tell, I am out $1,600+ and several hours of my life (not to mention the extreme stress of needing to scramble to find a place to stay) because the host wouldn’t simply agree to refund my money. 

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for the suggestions. I contacted media outlets, and after letting Airbnb know that I had done so, I received a fairly quick response (25 minutes) that they ""take these reports seriously and \[were\] currently investigating."" I got a full refund for my stay, plus reimbursements for expenses I had receipts for. This is the second time in the past month or so that I got immediate results from threatening a corporation (with court the other time) when multiple other attempts for reasonable reimbursement repeatedly failed.

**BACKSTORY:**

My lease ended at the end of August, and instead of rushing into a new apartment, I decided to take a couple months doing month-long Airbnb stays. The first host was great, and I really enjoyed my stay. 

On Tuesday, October 1, around 8:30PM, I got to my second reservation. I texted the host (Winston Nguyen) when I got there and he replied letting me know where the gate was to meet him. Another person was smoking outside, and asked me if I was going to “MD”. I wasn’t sure what he meant, so I said no. (I was a little cagey because I wasn’t sure the Airbnb was allowed based on the apartment complex’s rules.) He then asked “Are you here for the Airbnb?”, and while he was asking that, I saw the host walking toward the gate, so I sort of made a noise and avoided answering the question. Then he said, “I’m about to call the cops.” I wasn’t a hundred percent sure what he said, but that’s what it sounded like. I figured he was a busybody/nosy neighbor type and wasn’t too concerned, because lease violations aren’t in the NYPD’s jurisdiction. 

The host walked me in the building. The apartment was right on the first floor, apartment MD. I told him, “Oh, someone outside said something about MD, but I didn’t really understand them, so I thought there was a CityMD in the building or something,” and he mentioned that coincidentally, there had actually been a doctor’s office in the unit at one point.

He showed me around the apartment, and mentioned that there was a renter in the third bedroom who hadn’t paid yet, but he (the host) was trying to be as lenient as possible. Overall, he seemed very nice and charming. After he showed me the apartment, he showed me the laundry room and storage and told me a bit about the building— everything seemed great. The host seemed very nice and personable.  

So I went to my room, changed into pajamas, and was settling into bed/considering ordering delivery, when I heard a very light knock on my bedroom door. When I answered, it was the man who had been smoking outside (and, presumably, the other renter). 

Before I said anything, he said “I’m trying to be very discreet. I found some things out about this man, and he’s not a good person. Google his name. He’s a pedophile. And he’s being evicted, so I don’t know how long you’ll be staying here.” Then he turned and walked back down the hallway.

I was in minor shock and still thought that maybe this person was being dramatic. I didn’t actually know the host’s last name, but I was able to Google his first name and the address of the building\*, and I found his full name that way. 

As soon as I Googled him, a plethora of articles came up about how he recently been arrested and ~~charged with~~ is under investigation for \[EDIT, thank you u/AustEastTX\] catfishing teenagers (including students at the high school where he worked as a teacher) into sending him naked pictures, and had stolen $300,000 from an elderly man who he was a personal care aide for. I didn’t find anything about the eviction, but, obviously, I didn’t feel safe or comfortable staying in an apartment with someone who would do this. (In addition to my personal safety, I work at a preschool. While catfishing teenagers and preying on toddlers are two different things, a) this guy clearly has a wide breadth of creepiness; b) I need to be in a good mental state to properly care for children, and living in an unsafe place is not conducive to that; and c) if families found out that their children’s teacher was living with a sexual predator, they would be reasonably EXTREMELY concerned about that, and that could easily put my job and career in jeopardy\*\*.) 

It was already late, and I was still in shock, so I decided to stay the night, try to keep as low profile as possible, and bring my stuff to storage in the morning before work. I had off work Thursday and Friday, and already had plans to be out of town starting Wednesday evening, so I figured I would use that time to figure things out. I considered leaving my stuff and coming back for it, but while I didn’t find anything about the eviction, I didn’t want to risk it not being accessible. 

So after freaking out about this until midnight, I woke up in the morning, showered, and got ready for work. When I tried to leave, the apartment door wouldn’t open. This is a weird thing for an adult human in the twenty first century to say, but I am TERRIBLE at doors. Locks that no one else thinks are tricky take me several minutes to open every time I use them. So it is ENTIRELY plausible, and in fact likely, that nothing creepy was happening in regards to this. However, I tried everything I could think of to open this door (pushing when I clearly needed to pull, latching and unlatching different locks, etc.). I could see the latch moving when I turned the knob, and that all of the latches were unlocked, but the door *would. not.* open. Again, I don’t know what this guy would’ve gotten out of locking me in his apartment, so there was probably something I could have done to get the door open, but at this point I was not going to risk that he was also a serial killer. I went back into the bedroom, locked the door to the room, opened the window and screen, and threw my shit out the window, then lowered myself down with my backpack on and jumped out the window. A high point in my life! 

I ran to the front of the building, ordered a Lyft, and called my sister to let her know I was safe. 

**AIRBNB’S RESPONSE:**

Ok, so all that was to say that Airbnb’s response was/has been absolute garbage. 

A little more background: I had to make a second Airbnb account at some point because I couldn’t get my log-in information for my regular account. My phone number is associated with my alternative account and I can’t have the same number associated with two accounts, but also couldn’t delete my number from the one account without adding another. I had requested to book a place via this account a few months ago, but it wasn’t available. None of this was initially at the front of my mind (or on my mind at all) when dealing with Airbnb support. 

So my memory isn’t the greatest when I’m stressed out, and this was an incredibly stressful and chaotic process, so I might be a little fuzzy on some of the details of the phone calls, but I have done my best to fact check myself and be as accurate as possible. What I can tell you is that I called Airbnb three times on Friday and Saturday, spoke to at least 3 Airbnb agents, got disconnected (nobody’s fault) once or twice, and had my messages to Airbnb support marked as “Closed due to inactivity” multiple times. 

The first thing I did on these calls was to explain the problem and what I wanted (at the time, to be rebooked in an equivalent room at no charge to me, because I wouldn’t be able to find something at the last minute at a price I could afford). The agent who I spoke to for more than a couple minutes put my call on hold (totally understandable), then returned and asked something about my stay with Andrew. I told her “No, Winston. I don’t know who Andrew is.” She said “Winston, Winston, Winston”, as though she was looking for the reservation (which, to be clear, I assume she was), asked for the reservation code, then said “Ok, you’re all set to stay there.” (I don’t remember exactly how she worded this, but something to the effect that I had successfully booked this reservation and could stay in this apartment). Whatever— she’s probably overworked and had to field other issues while I was on hold or something. But still, it was a frustrating thing to hear in that moment. So I explained the situation again, and she said someone would get back to me later that day about the situation. 

Guess what? No one did!

In the meantime, I figured out what the confusion was re: Andrew (it was a stay I had attempted to book on the alternative account for the same start date). I requested to delete the alternate account via the website, but needed Airbnb’s approval to do so. 

So the next day, I called again, and explained which account I was calling in reference to, in addition to what the issue was. After putting me on hold, the agent came back and said “Ok, what’s the issue?”, which, again, whatever. I’m sure he’s busy and I can’t totally blame him for this. But then, when I explained again that the number I was calling from was not associated with the account I was calling about, he kept asking me about “the account \[I was\] calling from.” I had a lot of difficulty getting across to him that these are both my accounts, and the one I was calling in reference to did not have a number associated with it that I could call from. Finally, he assisted me in deleting the alternate account and I was able to add my phone number to my actual account and move forward. 

So, at some point in all of this, immediately after I explained the problem (for the second or third time), he asked me if I had contacted my host to cancel the reservation. Which … no. I had not contacted my host, informed him that he was a sexual predator, and requested a refund 🤷🏻‍♀️. Call me cynical, but that’s seems like a dead end. He said that he was going to contact the host, and did not seem receptive to the idea that there was no way that was going to go anywhere in terms of getting me a refund. He also kept thanking me for “sharing my thoughts” (dude, I have a therapist. I’m calling to get a refund.), and saying they “have to do what’s fair.”

He asked me for documentation of what I’d found, so I sent screenshots of articles from the New York Times, the New York Post, and New York Magazine, all using this guy’s full name and explaining his history, and at least two with photos of him. When I got a reply (at 3:36AM that night/the next morning), it said (all emphases mine):

>Hi Natasha,

>Apologies for the delay response. I just got a response from your Host, and unfortunately, he has decided to uphold his cancellation policy. I am really sorry if this is not the outcome that you hoped for.

>As much as I'd love to shorten your stay and process the refund for you, **since the Host has not given me the authorization to process any refund, I won't be able to proceed**.

>It really breaks my heart that your request cannot be granted at this time. I hope that you understand that if there was anything that I could do, I could have done it right away without any hesitation.

>My goal is to make sure that you get the best experience without compromising the policies we have in place. I understand that it's a bit disheartening at this point, however, **we are bound to abide by certain regulations**.

An hour later, I replied:

>Why would the host decide to shorten my stay? AirBnB needs to refund my money for allowing me to be put in an unsafe situation with a predator as a host. This is an outrageous situation

Six hours after that, the reply from Airbnb was:

>Thanks for your response. I understand your frustration. My role here is to treat you fairly to help you and your guest reach an agreement for a resolution. If both of you are unable to reach an agreement with my help, **I will then have to make a decision**. However, my aim is to **ensure that it’s fair for both of you**.

(A couple things about this message: To me, the line “I will then have to make a decision” directly contradicts the previous statement that they “are bound to abide by certain regulations,” and that there is absolutely nothing Airbnb can do here. And, I think this is obvious, how the f\*\*\* is this “fair to both of” us? I have no bargaining chips here, and there is no reason a person like this host is going to just give me my money back if he doesn’t lose anything by not doing so. Airbnb should be the ones to enforce a refund if their clients are put in an unsafe situation.)

Then, an hour and a half after that:

>I just wanted to make sure that you receive our message. I hope that I was still able to help you with your concern. We really apologize for the inconvenience, **I hope that this will not deter you from using Airbnb**.

>Just always remember, even if we're **unable to accommodate all requests**, Airbnb truly values user and we are always here to support you when any issue arises. Again, we really apologize for the inconvenience. But thank you so much for your understanding and patience working with me. I really appreciate it.

>Thank you also for letting me assist you with your case. I'll close this case for now, but please know that we are here with you all throughout your Airbnb journey so if ever you need assistance, just email us or contact us, and we'll be more than happy to assist. Again, thank you for being the best part of the community. I wish you a wonderful day and stay safe!

(Other than the bolded text, all messages are copied and pasted from the message thread without any omissions or editing on my part.)

So . . . absolutely laughable to “hope that this will not deter \[me\] from using Airbnb.” Not only has this shown me that I am unsafe using Airbnb and will be afforded no protection by the company if I’m in a similar situation in the future, almost literally the only leverage I have in this situation is to delete my account after this gets resolved and never use their service again, despite the near-monopoly they have for this sort of accommodation. 

I am continuing communication with them, but not holding my breath about a desirable outcome. 

\*So, even if it had occurred to me to Google all of this beforehand, I didn’t have the address of the building until too close to the reservation date to cancel without a fee. There’s literally nothing I could have done differently in order to find out who this guy was and cancel my reservation in time according to policy.

Airbnb,My Airbnb host is blaming me for damage to her countertop that I know my friends and I didn’t cause. What are my next steps? [CANADA],"Reposting since my first post got no replies 😭

Me and 7 other friends of mine checked out of an Airbnb on Sunday. It was overall a great stay so this morning (Tuesday) I left a 5 star review. Now, about 4 hours later I get a text from her showing “damage” she states we’ve caused to her countertop and she sends a a picture of what looks like either a a small irregular hole, chip or burn mark in the countertop. Maybe 1x1cm. I’m not sure what would’ve caused this, and I’m 100% sure it wasn’t my group, I’ve asked them as well. 

She’s now saying the entire countertop needs to be replaced. She called me and I denied that we did this and I asked her to send more pictures. And pictures of the whole countertop. She said she wasn’t able to at the moment because it’s the cleaners that sent her the picture and she’s not there right now. 

I’m not about to pay for something we didn’t do. What’s my best course of action here? Also removing my credit card isn’t an option because I have another trip booked on the platform with it in December and it won’t let me remove it due to that. 

Also do I contact Airbnb or wait for her to make a move?

Airbnb,Airbnb ruined my Christmas and my son's birthday.,"Finally got my own Airbnb horror story. Checked in yesterday. Unit has no water since last night. No place to brush our teeth, no drinking water, no place to poop. Host is doing nothing other than the generic ""looking into it"" messages. Then they just ghosted us. Airbnb support is doing the same thing. We had to book a nearby hotel. This is a ""superhost"" with 60+ listings so they definitely had lots of empty units in the area, they just didn't give a fuck.

I've spent over 160 nights at Airbnbs this year alone and this is the first time I needed their support. Seeing how bad it is, I would be a fool to ever use them again.

TL;DR: Kayla Laatz manages two AirBnBs (average ~$600 a night) inside a beach resort in Kauai, Hawaii, and recently upped the cleaning fees on the properties from $200 to $250 to pay their cleaner a better wage, cover the cost of supplies, and replace linens or towels.

Airbnb,"London host listed a social housing unit, and Airbnb won't refund the fees [England]","We showed up with our young kids for a multiple-week (so expensive) stay in London, only to discover upon arrival that it was a government social housing building. There were police circling the block and some unsavory characters milling around – it definitely didn't seem safe for us to stay there with our young kids.

Of course the listing made no mention of this fact, and it appears to be [illegal to do this](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49149983)?

We had to find urgent alternative (more expensive) accommodations with our bags and kids by the road, and then ultimately booked and stayed in a different Airbnb.

  
Airbnb support were rude to my wife on the phone while we were literally stressing out on the side of the road – it seems that their offshore support team also didn't understand what we meant by council-provided social housing.

After having to repeatedly chase this up, and getting bounced between 5 different Airbnb support agents, they didn't refund the platform fees, so we're still out over $500.

The kicker is that we ended up paying Airbnb twice - once for the fraudulent, cancelled booking, and then for the one we actually stayed in.

Any ideas how to escalate this with Airbnb support? Or should we just submit a report to London city council?",25,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1f5y47y/london_host_listed_a_social_housing_unit_and/,2024-08-31 21:31:43,Booking.com
Airbnb,Discrimination against guide dog," 

If you’re wondering why people don’t disclose their service dogs to hosts, this is why! 

I see so many posts here claiming the problem is “fake service dogs” and they would never deny a legitimate service dog. I did the host a COURTESY, and notified host that the other guest is visually impaired and has a guide dog beforehand to be considerate, and avoid the anxiety and problems in check in, not to ask for permission. This is an entire apartment, NOT shared. According to host profile, she doesn’t even live in the same state, so I seriously doubt she’s cleaning it herself, she also has 10+ units. 

This is her response, now we are out of places to stay that are near everywhere we need it to be, have 3 weeks open, and have an elevator or are on the first floor, and aren’t shared, within our budget. The host hasn’t even had these dates blocked off by Airbnb, or the automated review posted. The representative told me “make sure you ask or notify the host before booking!” so they can discriminate freely without consequences, right?

Why is Airbnb, a company that has partnerships with the National Federation of the Blind, not providing hosts or employees any education on accessibility?

“Just book pet-friendly accommodations!” Except there aren't any that fit the budget, needs, amenities, or location or be on the first floor/elevator access.  If you don't want to host service animals and follow anti-discrimination laws, then you shouldn't be in business.  Also, my only reason could be that we liked the pool better at the non-pet-friendly place,  or I didn't like the vibes of the pet-friendly places. 

All the ""options"" of similar price points Airbnb has given me have stairs, and are a good 15+ miles out of the way of what we need, and in case you didn't know - blind people can't drive, meaning proximity to public transit and walking distance of things is important.  I have asked airbnb to cover the cost difference of a similar unit in the same area, I was offered a $100 coupon, which doesn't come close, and no we are not going to stay in a hotel for almost a month.

Airbnb,Need help navigating a sketchy Airbnb reservation [UK],"My older and not-so-tech-savvy parent booked [this listing](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1166755649665517487) in London for 9 days over Christmas. (I know.) I didn't see the listing until today and screamed when I did.

I assume it's a scam. The property has no reviews despite being listed for months, and the host only has one other property in a different city with a single 1-star review by someone saying it was already occupied when they showed up.

The address that shows in our reservation gives the address of a Marks & Spencer. The ""where you'll be staying"" map (not the listing map) does show a residential street about half a mile away, but I'm obviously skeptical.

Unfortunately since this was booked a couple months ago we are out of the free cancellation window and will only get a 50% refund if we cancel ourselves and book something more trustworthy.

I'm planning to get in touch with Airbnb support tomorrow but know how awful they can be.

Airbnb,Host is asking for a deposit to be put down outside of the app. [USA],"I know that you're not supposed to send money outside of Airbnb, but this person is a super host. I don't have a lot of experience with Airbnb so I was wondering if you guys had any advice for me. Thank you!

Here's the exchange so far:

Host:
Hi,

Thanks for booking Round Mtn!

I have entered your Airbnb booking into our main booking system.

Could you take a second to click on the following link? This will open a POC (point of contact) form and renter agreement that we ask all guests to sign before coming out to Round Mtn.

e-Signature form for Booking # ORB12353008

If the above link does not work, please copy and paste the URL below to access the Rental Agreement for signature.

https://orez.io/v1/f/5fb453c5139e410bb381a3a9756cb122

If you could take care of this ASAP, that will complete your booking for Round Mtn. Also, to confirm your check-in time will start at 4pm at the earliest. If early check-in is available you will be notified on the morning of your check-in.

Talk to you soon and thanks for booking!


Me: Sorry, that is how people get scammed and airbnb specifically warns against it.

Host: Good Morning, We do require a rental agreement and security deposit for all bookings. As the platform does not have a way to provide this directly we have a resort style software ""Owner Rez"" which helps process both. You will see additional information including a copy of the full rental agreement in the Additional Rules section of our listing.


So how do I proceed? The property looks really nice and I want to make it happen but not sure if this is safe to go along with. 

Here is the property in question:

Airbnb,[CAN] A TikToker went viral after she found 'hidden cameras' in electrical outlets in her Airbnb. Police investigated. Airbnb suspended host. Months later police investigation has determined they were just regular outlets.,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktoker-went-viral-she-found-144554522.html

Kennedy Calwell, one of 15 friends staying at the rental, posted about their experience of finding the ""camera"" in a TikTok video in April which went viral.

She explained that one of her friends was ""paranoid"" and checked each room with a flashlight and eventually thought she found a camera inside electrical outlets facing the shower in two of the bathroom on the property.

The group alerted local police who searched the property 

Sunshine Coast RCMP confirmed to Insider at the time that an investigation was ongoing.

An Airbnb spokesperson told Insider at the time that the listing had since been suspended and refunded the group for the booking.

RCMP said that the electrical outlets were removed and sent to a laboratory for investigation.

But on June 30, the examination findings revealed that it was actually just an electrical outlet and did not contain any camera, lenses, or storage/recording devices.",179,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/156k5rn/can_a_tiktoker_went_viral_after_she_found_hidden/,2023-07-22 13:27:14,Booking.com

Airbnb,"A warning for travelers booking short-term Airbnb rentals in Bangkok, Thailand","I recently learned the hard way about the risks of booking short-term Airbnb rentals in Bangkok. Upon arriving at the building where I had booked a condo, I was confronted by a security guard who questioned my presence and became angry when I mentioned that I had rented the property on Airbnb. The guard proceeded to pull out a stack of documents and point to a specific phrase stating that ""Airbnb Daily & Weekly Rentals are Illegal in Thailand - Hotel Act, Immigration Act, and Building Control Act.""

I left the building and contacted Airbnb to report the issue. However, I was disappointed to learn that the company was not willing to take any responsibility for this and stated it was the guest's responsibility to ensure that the condo was legal - I was informed that my booking was non-refundable.

This experience was a cautionary tale for anyone considering booking an Airbnb in Bangkok for less than 30 days - be sure to do your due diligence and verify the legality of the property before confirming your reservation, as the consequences of booking an illegal property can be severe, including the loss of your payment

Two pages of reviews of me, I could add more: [https://imgur.com/a/ZuM1Q7P](https://imgur.com/a/ZuM1Q7P)

Proof of 9 upcoming trips (10 as of this edit): [https://imgur.com/a/fe8EX1s](https://imgur.com/a/fe8EX1s)

**Original Post:**

I've never left a negative review before, and I was very careful to bullet the exact issues.

I get a message saying ""The review didn’t have enough relevant information to help the Airbnb community make informed booking or hosting decisions.""

This is obviously a vague policy that lets support work with problematic hosts to keep bad reviews out of sight. I had five bullets, each clearly specifying the exact issues that arose. I haven't had any of those issues at any of the past 48 stays I've booked with Airbnb.

Worse yet, anticipating my negative review, the host of course wrote a negative review of me, which Airbnb is allowing to stay up. I did just speak to an Ambassador who is appealing on my behalf after our call.

UPDATE 1: same boiler plate response and vague policy reference; I also just learned that a 2021 survey found that 75% of customer complaints are about the poor customer service, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

UPDATE 2: appealed again to support, and same boiler plate response.

UPDATE 3: I filed a BBB complaints, wrote a letter to the CEO linking this reddit thread, then spent 30 minutes gathering the relevant sections from the app's message log with the host accusing me of random things that all later proved to be the Nanny or the wife's doing. After documenting all of this (also documented in the BBB complaint), and filing yet ANOTHER airbnb support request, they apparently got nervous and immediately pulled the host's review of me citing the same vague language of it ""not being useful."" That appears to be their catch-all method of excusing any action they wish.

Because they closed the third case, I've opened a fourth requesting a formal complaint filed against the host and demanding an investigation into the host's practices of accusing guests of things they are not doing and have no control over. Here's an excerpt that finally got support's attention. The sad part is this was all in the messages. They were just too lazy to go read them. I had to do their job for them -- again.

Pardeep 6:47 PM

Friendly reminder please turn off kitchen lights after finishing in kitchen.

Pardeep 11:17 AM

Hey Mark!Just wanted to let u know last night kitchen light was on again and no one in kitchen!

Pardeep 12:58 PM

Mark!Last night before we came in lounge light was left on and we turned off before we turn on light for other side!

We have discus our switching lights off before too!

Mark 9:37 PM

Hey Pardeep, I just brought my own light into the kitchen as discussed to ensure it's not me leaving it on, and sure enough, the kitchen light was on. The nanny was there. I got a drink out of the fridge, reminded her about the light as I left -- but I stayed in the hallway to watch. She just walked outside and left it on. Do I turn it off? Is she using the kitchen and just went outside for some reason? Maybe she is the one leaving it on?

Pardeep 9:38 PM

She’s doing milk bottle for Hason and ll turn it off when finishing.

This is one of a variety of similar issues the host kept accusing me of until he figured out it wasn't me. I later began to suspect the live-in Nanny didn't like having airbnb guests because she gets the house to herself unless someone is staying there. I think she intentionally tried to generate stress between the host and guest to get them to give it up hosting. There were other incidents that seemed to confirm this.

What's so foolish about Airbnb's customer support response is the brand just took a huge hit for me. I'd now gladly jump ship in an instant because it's clear Airbnb now is willing to let future guests walk into the same trap I just landed in with that host. (UPDATE: just downloaded Abb's largest competitor app and it appears I get hotels and short-term rental options all in one place).

I'm now in the process of attempting to replace then cancel all 9 of my upcoming stays, totaling many thousands of dollars, which I can still do since those cancel-by dates haven't arrived yet. It's time to give Airbnb back what they're giving to me: nothing.

With a closed review system like this, it's pretty clear they've gone the way of amazon reviews. It's essentially fake because critical reviews get removed with vague claims of lack of information.

Airbnb,Spotted a nasty little surprise buried deep down in the 'house rules' - is this allowed? [Thailand],"I'll preface this by stating that I've used Airbnb plenty of times all over the world, and the price I pay through Airbnb upon booking is the full, definitive amount.

I booked a two week stay in a condo in Thailand. The price is pretty much exactly what I'm used to paying for a condo in Thailand, so I didn't think anything of it and booked and paid for the non-refundable booking.

I decided to take another look at the place later on, and I realise buried in the house rules under 'other rules', they have 'you must pay for electricity and water upon check out'.

I'm a digital nomad and am always on the move, living in hotels, airbnbs and the occasional offline short term rental. The only time I've ever had to pay water and electricity are through the offline agreements. 

It never even crossed my mind to check for additional charges, because I've literally never experienced this in all my time using either Booking.com or Airbnb.

Does Airbnb really allow this?

Airbnb,"Large dead cockroach, dirty bedding, unusable pool, no smoke alarm – I canceled after the first night but Air Bnb will not refund me","My sister and I recently booked a 7 night stay at an Air Bnb. When we got there, we were disgusted by how dirty it was. Here’s a summary and [photos](https://imgur.com/a/zxi44AE) of the issues we noticed:

* Sheets were stained or had loose hair/debris on them. We washed them and the stains lifted which lets us know the sheets were not washed before we arrived.
* We found dead bugs on the floor, including a huge cockroach under the bedside table in the master bedroom.
* The cutting boards, mugs, spoons, and many dishes we looked at were dirty. They were put away with food debris still on them.
* The floors were dirty. They had dust, hair, and an old hair elastic on them. They had not been swept or mopped.
* There were no kitchen towels.
* The pool was green, cloudy, and unclean. It could not have been brought into swimmable conditions during our week long stay.
* There were no smoke detectors.
* The drains in both bathroom showers were clogged, and one of the toilets would not flush properly.

We arrived Saturday April 22 pretty late and were exhausted from traveling and family obligations (we were traveling under stressful circumstances, not for vacation). At 10:46pm we messaged the host to let him know about these issues. We didn’t feel like trying to find somewhere else to stay for the night at that point, so we sucked it up, washed all the sheets and tried to make the best of it.

The host messaged us back at 11:35pm apologizing and telling us that the cleaning lady must have been rushed and that the previous guest turned off the pool pump. He said the cleaning lady could come Sunday morning to spot clean, and he would send someone to work on the pool.

We did not really want a cleaner there while we were sleeping, showering, having breakfast, etc. so we told the host not to send the cleaner. At this point, the host went from signing his messages “Bob” to “Tranvacation” which let us know it was some kind of property management company working through Air Bnb which made us feel even worse about the situation.

At 12:40am we messaged Air Bnb to let them know the issues with the house. We sent them a list along with photos.

The next morning, we had not heard back from Air Bnb support, but we knew we could not stay 6 more nights at this dirty house. We found a different Air Bnb in the area and booked it for the remaining nights we needed to be in town. At 1:43pm we canceled the rest of our stay at the dirty house. At 3:04pm we messaged the host to let him know we were out of the house.

We felt confident that based on [Air Bnb's cancellation policy](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2868/) we would get a refund for the cleaning fee and the nights we did not stay. In their refund policy, Air Bnb says “travel issues” include “accomodations that are… not reasonably clean and sanitary, including bedding and towels \[or accommodations\] contain pests” and “special amenity or feature… does not function (e.g. pool).” We reported all of that well within the 72 hour limit, so we booked a new house and left the dirty one with peace of mind that Air Bnb would have us covered.

Luckily the new house we rented was amazing. Everything was lovely and clean and their pool was in good condition. However on Tuesday April 25, Air Bnb support messaged us to basically let us know that ‘minor inconveniences’ are not covered under AirCover. My sister went back and forth with their support over a few messages, pointing out that the issues were cleanliness issues explicitly listed in Air Bnb’s refund policy and were reported within the 72 hours. At one point they addressed her by the wrong name and told us they couldn’t do anything since we didn’t report before 72 hours. It was like they were not paying attention to what she was saying at all. Eventually their support essentially told her they are siding with the Host and closing the case.

My sister found a phone number and called today to see if she could talk to someone and he said they will reopen the case, but based on our previous experience with their messaging support, we are not holding our breath that anything different will happen.

We are both generally easy going people who would rather put up with minor inconveniences than make a fuss. But the state of this house was absolutely not up to a minimum standard of cleanliness, and we are losing about $1000 dollars on this experience if we can’t get a refund.

Airbnb,"Long time hosts, have you noticed a steep decline in bookings? Hosts might be the product here...","It appears that Airbnb is harvesting hosts.  During the last corporate quarterly meeting, Chesky mentioned that 14,000 new hosts were added monthly last year.  What does that mean?  It means that we are beginning to see over saturation of stays.  Additionally, new hosts come with motivation to do good.  What does that mean?  It means that it benefits Airbnb to put new listings at the top of the search because those new stays are refreshed, everything is new, and new hosts are willing to bend backwards to make a guest happy.  Who wins?  Airbnb and guests.  Guests get newer refreshed listings and Airbnb rakes in cash on both ends.  $ABNB collects their guest fee and host fee.

* cooking utensils
* utensils
* scissors
* kitchen knives

Airbnb,"Airbnb being discriminatory against age when trying to book on Halloween weekend [Ontario, Canada]","Every year I host a Halloween party at my house and I have a group of friends that come from out of town to attend the party. Usually, they book a hotel to stay at for the night because I don’t have the room to accommodate them at my house after the party is over. This year however, the hotel prices in the area skyrocketed so they turned to Airbnb to seek a place to stay for the night. Little did I know this would be a week long ordeal for us back and forth with Airbnb support. My friends and I are all 24 years old. No matter which account we tried booking from, the booking would be denied because us booking it “could lead to an unauthorized party in the home”. 3 of my friends and I all tried from our individual accounts. We all have positive account ratings with past hosts and some even with extensive stay history. At first we suspected it was possible that host that was rejecting us somehow so we reached out to them. They said they could not accept the booking request from their end but had no issue having us at their property. We tried to book 3 separate properties from 3 different hosts all with the same outcome. 

Then we decided to individually call Airbnb support and give the same story about not being able to book. We explained that we had no intention of hosting a party in the house and we’d simply be using it to sleep. The support team member would create a ticket with a “specialized team” that would contact us via email within 24 hours. All 4 of us got identical emails. They look like [this](https://imgur.com/a/QGijrbS). No option to dispute the matter further. If you try calling support back, they’ll say they can’t do anything. Now we’re stuck with no affordable place for my friends to stay. Just for shits and giggles, I ask my Mom to try booking one of the properties from her account. Well, without hesitation the booking gets approved. She has even less of a stay history than some of my friends do. Still, the property gets booked with no issues. I was shocked. The only factor I can think of to deny us would be our age. It’s absolutely ridiculous that Airbnb can assume that because we’re 24, we are automatically going to throw a party. That’s insane! We are all responsible normal 24 year olds with jobs and educations. Furthermore, shouldn’t we be held accountable if something bad were to happen? Isn’t that the whole point of Airbnb taking information like our identification down when we sign up? It’s as if our money isn’t green. Very disappointing and I’d really like something to be done about this.

If you made it to this point, thank you for reading!

Airbnb,I was kicked out by my host for telling her that there may be an issue with cocroaches?[MEX],"

So I was staying at a booking. Here's some background: when I first got there, things were great. I told the host that I'd be extending a week. However, I realized that her quiet hours were going to conflict with my wfh schedule, so I proceeded to tell her that I actually would not be staying, as it would be better for both of us. She agreed. 

So until then - 3 days, I cancelled every late night meeting I had. Usually, my work situation is not a problem in airbnb, however this time my room was directly beside hers and the desk was up against the wall so I could hear everything she said and she could hear me also. Our rooms were so close that if I walked out of my room she could see me. There was even a mirror in her room and the door was always open, which was a bit unsettling because I was always reflected in the mirror in her bedroom if I needed to come out of my room for any reason. 


She did not state that the quiet hours meant no use of the kitchen, so I did not know. It was not in the listing and if it had been I wouldn't have booked the place to begin with. She had no rules besides don't let out the cat and to keep quiet after 11 pm, which is reasonable and I did my best to comply. 

However, during my 5 night stay (now 4), I went to make some food during the night. It was just about 1AM, and I heated up rice and beans. The kitchen is not very close to her bedroom, but it's a small flat so even if I open my door she would've probably been disturbed. I felt like I was walking on eggshells. 

When i went into the kitchen and turned on the light, I immediately saw a cockroach on the wall. I kinda panicked, and used a small towel to swat it away. I got close first, to confirm it was indeed the typical American cockroach. I thought about telling the host, since the reviews for this place were sparking, and I thought she may want to know. 

Immediately, she took me to the kitchen and started to point out that some rice had been spilled here or there, and said that because I spilled rice that i must have attracted the cockroach. 

Anyone who is familiar with cockroaches knows that, if you see one- there are likely more, and that points to a potential infestation or one that is likely impending if the problem is not approached proactively. Despite knowing this and feeling blamed, I told her that I had no intention of leaving a bad review, but that based on what I know an inspection might be in order to prevent it from becoming a serious issue. 

She than began accusing me of lying, saying that because I spilled rice I am the reason for the insects. Being mindful that she had also left fresh fruit and other food out on the counter for several hours and with the fruit, days since my stay started, I attempted to validate her by telling her that I would be more careful to clean the kitchen, but that I recommend that she investigate further. 


She then kicked me out on the spot, and airbnb completely supported her. I was left with no phone battery, no where to go, in the pouring rain and having the cancel my work in the middle of the day. She responded to my review where I stated basically the same thing I said in the post, by saying that I have a hygiene problem, and that my vaginal discharge left a stain on her sheets, obviously my body speaks for itself. That's what she said, and airbnb could only offer me a refund of one night and to remove her comment, but they only removed it from her profile and not the listing itself. 


This is what happened, I guess I just needed to vent. After using airbnb for 5 years, I've never had such an experience before.

Airbnb,Undisclosed Camera Inside House - am I Over reacting?,"I’m in San Antonio working an event and staying in an AirBnB for 12 days.  Looks normal and nice.  Got there yesterday and checked in and late last night discovered a mounted camera in the ceiling of the kitchen.

It has a clear view of the whole house and I feel creeped out knowing someone is watching us and probably listening too.

The listing did not disclose an internal camera.  Is this against ToS?  Here’s the video:


Here’s [AirBnB Camera (undisclosed)](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRGcKfJE/)

I plan to contact AirBnB and work to get out of this reservation and move somewhere else for the next 12 days.

Updates ( I just shared an IG video update [here](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CofnkicLmKA/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=)) 
-this is a whole home rental <br>
-listing only discloses external cameras
-the video camera is ON and it’s line of sight is the main area of the home, including the living room with the couch
-it’s been 24hrs and AirBnB has not contacted me back about it
-I’ve located and unplugged the Camera box (I think)
-we work all day and then go back to Airbnb at night, it’s difficult to find time to facilitate a move and find a new spot.  It doesn’t help the Rodeo is in town and a lot of options in SA are booked.",63,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/10y3x7k/undisclosed_camera_inside_house_am_i_over_reacting/,2023-02-09 19:36:57,Booking.com
Airbnb,SO made a mistake on the days and the host is eating 50% of the money. [UK],"We've been working no stop for the past couple months and finally had a break to plan a vacation. 


In her defence, she have almost exclusively used booking.com previously. Also it was late, she was tired and still recovering from being sick for a week already. 
She booked the flight and everything else, but couple minutes after confirming the AirBnB booking she noticed she mixed up the month.
Booked to January while everything else is booked on February.


We contacted right away the host but it was late night. Next day, nothing from host until later in the day after we messaged again. 
He's reply was: 50% to cancel.
He has half a dozen other properties but none available for our dates.

Support says it all depends on him, they supposedly contacted him, but he's not budging.


And here we are, feeling like we got straight up mugged out of a quarter month's worth in salary in Poland. 


What service doesn't at least allow for a short grace period to fix mistakes?
We're now going to chase a charge back through our bank now, it was through a debit card but there should be mechanisms for it anyway.

Airbnb,"Host harassed me about leaving a one star and now harassing me because I reported her to Airbnb and she got deactivated [Shore, NJ]","
Gave a host 1 star and she started messaging me on app and by text complaining about it using vulgar language. I sent the messages to Airbnb and she was deactivated,

Now she is texting even more about how Labor Day is when she gets high pricing and all her bookings were cancelled. I would block her but she was a bitch so I kind of enjoy this.

Airbnb,Florida Man goes from zero to snark when denying my stay request. [USA],"For my current job, I travel full time.  I'm in a new city every 2-4 weeks and have been on a rotation of company paid housing at extended stay hotels, or taking our travel buyout and finding my own place at Sonders or AirBnBs.

So far, all my AirBnB experiences have been great and I've had pleasant interactions with all my hosts, even when there was something that needed attention in the rental...

...Until a few days ago when I was trying to book a place to stay in Tampa, FL for the beginning of February.

The listing in question talked up the property a lot and even mentioned that it would be the host's primary residence if they didn't travel so much.  The listing did have this bit written at the end: 

>Other things to note  
\*\*\*READ FIRST PLEASE\*\*\* UPDATE: This house has mainly become an annual rental. 60 day minimum stay is almost always in place due to demand.

The selection of properties in my price range that were also close to my jobsite were slim.  This note at the end gave me pause, but I saw the ""almost always"" and assumed that if it let me click the request button for a 2-week stay, perhaps this is one of the exceptions to the rule of the 60 day minimum.

I was wrong.

Ten minutes later I get a reply from the host after declining my request.  Here is the short conversation that ensued:

&#x200B;

>FLORIDA MAN  11:04 PM  
Please read the listings before you make requests. 60 day minimum on this house stated multiple places. Saves wasting everyone’s time. Good luck.

&#x200B;

>ME  11:12 PM  
I did read the listing and it states ""60 minimum stay is almost always in place.""  
The word ""almost"" indicates that sometimes it may be available for shorter stays. And I have no way of knowing that without submitting a request.  
If you consider it a waste of time to respond to requests, perhaps you should set a minimum stay for your listing to avoid any misunderstandings in the future.  
Here's a link to the AirBnB help article on setting minimum or maximum nights for your listing: [https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/880](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/880)

&#x200B;

>FLORIDA MAN 11:13 PM  
Jesus. Buddy, you made an official request before asking a single question like 99% of other do for efficiency sake. That would’ve been your question. Not trying to be right. Like I said, good luck.

&#x200B;

>ME 11:18 PM  
I have no issue with my request being declined. I also have no issue with your minimum stay requirements. It's your house to make available to whomever for however long you wish. I do have an issue with the attitude of your reply and insinuating that I wasted your time when you have not set up your listing to match your requirements. Have a good night.

&#x200B;

I was blown away by his immediate attitude with my request. I know that I instantly matched his snark level with my reply, but was I in the wrong?  

If AirBnB gives hosts the tools to automatically filter out requests that don't match their requirements I think the hosts should use them instead of trying to bully guests who were permitted by the website to submit a reservation request that didn't align with the hosts ambiguous language in the listing.

Airbnb,How I found out that AirBnb support from the ground up is simply designed to scam customers.,"**EDIT: This is kind of funny observing how biased this subreddit is lol. It looks like all the hosts protecting their income by shifting the attention from what this thread is about - how support is handling the complaints - to who was at fault, which has nothing to do with that, lol. Everyone seeking the help from the support deserve to be treated decently, no matter what the potential outcome of the case could be.**

Hello everyone. The purpose of this thread is to raise awareness for everyone who is traveling and picking AirBnb and to seek some advice, even tho I don't think there is anything a regular person can do in a case like mine.

So whopping 8 months ago I created [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/x4xchg/host_lost_my_belongings/) thread explaining what happened to me on my vacation in the US. Now I don't want to go much into the details of who fucked up etc., but just for the recap - long story short is - I had a trip planned with 8 different AirBnB, at one of the locations I forgot to take my backpack when driving away. The host offered to send it back to me; it was stolen from his car when sitting on a driveway overnight. 

**From the police report, I have found that the car remained UNLOCKED. Since the neighborhood seemed pretty nice and my travel insurance company decided to reject paying me back for stuff I've lost for this very reason and  it was a possibility that the host took it and since it was a lot of stress to me, I decided to reach out to AirBnb support and try hard to really stay persistent with the case.**

Below, I will post some timeline and my communication with AirBnb just to showcase how scammy it is and how little you can do since they can simply press a button to close your help request whenever they feel the case is inconvenient for them and silently tell you one big: FUCK YOU.

Anyway, there is a timeline and my ridiculous attempts to move the case forward.

So the thing happened **early 09/2022**. I contacted AirBnb support over the phone and was instructed that they will create a ticket and someone would reach out to me but that never happened. 

I decided to start with emails with the ""claims team"" to keep the log of all the conversation and explained my case.

First response I received **on 7th of Sept 2022** looked actually like this:
> Hi Pawel,
> 
> I'm Abril A from Airbnb Claims Team.
> 
> As the incident in question occurred outside of the booked listing, we cannot assist you with this incident.
> 
> We're truly sorry for any negative experience that has occurred in relation to this reservation and thankful to have you in our community. We hope you'll have better experiences with Airbnb moving forward. Should you have any questions or concerns in the future, we're available 24/7 at:

Since it looked super ridiculous to me, the same day I responded with:
> Oh. So what you are saying is that if it's just 10 mins after check out time host can just steal your things or throw it into the trash and airbnb has nothing to do with it?
> 
> Does it look right to you?

The same day I received a response:

> Hi Pawel,
> 
> I’m Matthew H, from Airbnb’s Claims team. I would request you kindly to fill the Host Liability insurance form.
> 
> In the rare event that any of your guests or a third party gets hurt or their belongings are damaged during a stay at your place, Host liability insurance provides $1M USD in coverage for your legal responsibility.
> 
> It also provides you with primary liability insurance coverage–that means it generally applies first, regardless of any insurance you may have.
> 
> How you submit a claim depends on when and where the reservation was.
> 
<here some details on the claims thing>

Now is where things get ridiculous. Right after coming back from my trip, on **11th of September 2022** I finally created a claim and provided all the documents, I received this email:
> Hi Pawel,
> 
> My name is Joseph K. I’m with Airbnb’s Claims team.
> 
> Thanks for submitting your Host liability insurance claim form—I’m now going to send it to Generali for review. They’ll assign a claims handler who’ll get in touch with you directly very soon.
> 
> In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reply to this message if you have any questions or concerns. I’m here to help.
> 
> Best,
> 

Now the ""fun"" begins, for 8 months the claim wasn't pushed forward even a tiny bit. Nobody ever contacted me from the Generali, and AirBnb kept repeating they cannot do anything, over and over. They designed this system to be able to delegate the responsibility to some 3rd party and then keep repeating you same stuff, anyway, here is a log:

**13th of Sept 2022 from AirBnb:**
> My name is Finola C with Airbnb’s Claims team, I will be the case handler at Airbnb for your Host Liability Insurance Claim.
> 
> Please note that your claim form was sent to our insurance partner and one of their designated insurance adjusters will contact you soon to discuss the next steps.
> 
> Should you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I will still be available as your Airbnb point of contact, although I won’t be able to discuss, mediate, or evaluate your Hli claim on your behalf.
> 
> Kind regards,

I provided all the documents but did not receive any contact from the insurance company. I proceed with:

**16th of Sept 2022 (ME):**
> Hello. 
> 
> First of all, once again I am including the police report.
> 
> Secondly, I've tried to contact Jennifer <redacted> who is handling the case by calling <redacted> like 10 times over last few days but there is only a voicemail and zero response.

* close the chat (ticket) without any response

* response and ask for details, then once I provide the details, they close the chat

* they call me, ask for some details, tell me there is not much they can do but they will ""forward this case to claims team"". Then after couple of days the case is closed.

Airbnb,Account wrongfully removed - what to do? [USA],"Hey all, long time AirBnB fan and user here in the US and abroad. I booked a nearby stay last month, updated my profile because it had been a while, and then got an email that my account had been removed, with the statement: 

""We've removed your account from the Airbnb platform because you haven't followed our [policy on illegal and prohibited activities](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/3064/illegal-and-prohibited-activities).""

I legitimately have no idea why my account was removed, since I don't do anything illegal to begin with, but I read through their list and certainly didn't break any rules according to AirBnB. I appealed it saying that I had no idea why it was removed and asking for a reason, and got a message that they were upholding their decision.

Anyone have experience with this?? Is there anyone I can contact to get my account back? I would be super bummed to lose access to AirBnB - it's been a really helpful travel tool for me.",2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1gjnb3q/account_wrongfully_removed_what_to_do_usa/,2024-11-04 19:46:25,Booking.com

Airbnb,Should I book the Airbnb prior or see it first? (Host offered) [Albania],"Background:
https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnb_hosts/comments/1gwy6da/listing_price_changed_after_expressing_interest/

I asked the host if they could do $600 and they agreed... but they said the following paraphrased:

""The price works for me as having one guest is better than having multiple. I'm mostly not home because I'm working. ****If it works for you, you can see the house before you come and than decide. We can arrange the payment****""

The host has 1, 5 star review for hosting, 1, 5 star review as a guest, and basically no bookings on the property going forward (it is off season tho).

I'm wondering two things:

1) Shoukd I just book the 2.5 months through the platform right off the bat? Book at least a month to at least have that reservation, then book longer if I like it? I just don't want to have to move to another place a month in, ie why I'm trying to book longer.

2) Does this sound unsafe? Like should I be worried? Should I see if the host can video call or something prior? If so, how do I get there number because I thought exchanging contacts would result in ban?

I want the place booked for peace of mind, but also if the host wants cash, should I go that way? Or am I getting set up to be robbed? (Also maybe the host only has 1 review because they always do cash deals?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1gxm3gl/should_i_book_the_airbnb_prior_or_see_it_first/,2024-11-22 23:53:32,Booking.com

Airbnb,Please Help Me Write an Honest Review about Airbnb in an AWFUL Location,"First off I just want to say I have stayed in over 100 Airbnbs and ive only ever rated 2 poorly. So I only do this when it's absolutely necessary. 

We stayed in Marrakech, Morocco recently and our Airbnb had a 4.8 star rating from many reviews. When we got there it turned out to be in an AWFUL part of the city. I mean it looked convenient but it turned out to be in a really dangerous/extremely unfriendly area (ive been to over 40 countries and I've never felt that level of vulnerability to danger and disdain before like in this neighborhood). In fact during the check in process the host took me to the roof top terrace and proceeded to explain a laundry list of scams/dangers happening in the neighborhood (some of which were attempted on us on our way there) and then he even spotted one AS IT WAS HAPPENING and narrated what was going to happen step by step. I thought I was in a hidden camera show. To make matters worse the airbnb was right next to a leather tannery. The main bedroom STUNK of rotting skin because of the work going on right outside the window. Thankfully we aren't PETA employees or else we might have had heart attacks. I went outside alone one more time to get groceries after checking in and had the worst 1 hour walk of my life. I felt like I was walking through the Upside Down in Stranger things. Everything about this neighborhood was either really crappy or wanting to kill you. This was such a horrible neighborhood all the way through and there was no way to get a taxi in or out of there to avoid it. So we spent the next 3 days staying inside until our flight home because it wasn't worth risking our necks going back outside again. We're on a tight budget this month and it wasn't worth booking another place either nor going through the awkward request to ask for a refund from the host or through some weird airbnb mediation process. 

I was so confused about how bad this location was I had to recheck if I booked the right place and read through all the reviews but I found zero red flags, no mentions of ""unsafe area"" nor ""AWFUL SMELL"".  But then I learned today as I understand it, people are not allowed to mention these two issues that are ""out of the host's control"". Ok so this explains why it has no reviews mentioning these two VERY IMPORTANT details that had I known I would have NEVER stayed there.  I also actually found out this airbnb used to be a hotel but it's still on Google maps with reviews mentioning THESE 2 VERY IMPORTANT DETAILS and to make it worse the owners/hosts used to mark it in a different location on booking.com's map apparently. Not surprising in the least because it turns out this neighborhood has a really bad reputation. So how can I allude to these issues without getting my review deleted by airbnb?",59,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/vquao8/please_help_me_write_an_honest_review_about/,2022-07-03 23:50:21,Booking.com
Airbnb,"First time hosting: violent domestic dispute, police showed up [Canada]","TL;DR: My first guests ever in my basement suite had a violent domestic dispute, cops ended up at my house, and their reservation was cancelled. 

I’ve been using Air BnB as a guest for 11 years. Last month my tenant moved out of my basement suite, and my wife and I decided to furnish the suite and rent it out on air BnB.

We put so much love into the decor, we provided free Nespresso, snacks, coffee creamer, tea, welcome chocolates on the pillows, and all the good regular stuff you’d want from a short stay rental. 

I even had a professionally designed welcome package made. We were very excited. 

On day one of publishing we got our first reservation request!! We were so excited. We checked their profile and they had good reviews so we accepted. 

In hindsight, we should have chatted them up beforehand and asked for more details, reason for their stay, etc. but we went off of the reviews because we were just pumped that someone has reserved so quickly.

The guest messaged us “We’re looking forward to our stay!” 

We sent them a welcome message with some instructions on their check in day. 

No reply. 

We sent another follow up offering our cell number just in case. 

No reply. 

We sent another message that evening asking if they had everything they needed, and how they were settling in. 

No reply. 

They had seen every single message, but not replied. 

At this point we were a little confused. Guest communication is important. And this isn’t some rental condo… this is our house. In our basement separated by a small door. We can hear them downstairs and they can hear us upstairs. 

But no reply. 

We thought it odd. We asked family members who had also been air BnB hosts if this was normal, and they said it happens and that some people just want to be left alone. 

So we tried considering that and left it alone. But there was something nagging the back of our mind about it. It didn’t feel right. 

The next day, I go to work (I work from home on the second floor), and my wife is downstairs in the living room. She starts hearing some commotion at around 4 pm. 

Yelling… swearing starts coming upstairs. 

My dogs freak out and start barking and one of them runs down the stairway that leads to the air BnB door. 

My wife runs after him to bring him upstairs.  She grabs him when he’s outside the closed/locked door to the air BnB unit… and that’s when she hears it. 

Physical violence, yelling, a woman screaming. Then shouting “You’re a fucking loser!!”

My wife runs up the stairs panicked, calls for me. I come downstairs from the top floor and she is having a panic attack. She is hyperventilating. Telling me that the guy in the unit is beating her up and that she was screaming bloody murder.

Were freaked out. And that’s when we hear from outside, the guests leaving the unit. We hear their footsteps coming up the stairs outside. 

So we go up to my office and look out the window to the front of the house. The woman is taking a bunch of stuff out of our unit to her truck parked out front. 

My wife sends her another message on air BnB saying we heard some commotion and asking if she’s alright or if she needs help. 

No reply. Sees the message but no reply. 

We see her going back and forth and loading her truck. It seems like she’s about to check out early. 

She gets in the truck and leaves!! 

But her guest is still in our basement! 

Now at this point I should tell you she was the one who booked the unit. And she said she had a “guest” with her. The guest had no name. So now there’s a violent male alone in our basement, who did not book the unit. We don’t know his name, or anything about him, except that he’s a violent man who hits women. 

30 minutes later she replies the message on air BnB and says “sorry for the commotion, we’ll keep it down. Yep everything’s fine!”

Then 10 minutes later she arrives again in her truck. This time she parks the truck not in front of our house like before, but around the corner out of sight. 

We’re still watching out of my office window. 

5 minutes later, the male comes out of our unit and walks around the corner to the truck. 

We are confused and worried. 

We decide to call the non emergency police and report what happened. They take all the info, including a license plate for their truck and the guests name. 

An hour after we called the police, they called us back. Apparently BOTH the male and the female guest had separately called the police to report domestic issues earlier… but they had just said they were in an air BnB and didn’t give an address. So because of our report, they now connected the dots and knew the address of the air BnB. 

So the cops said they were coming over to do a check in. We were worried, because now they’re going to know we reported it and this could result in backlash towards us from a violent guest. They could trash our unit or worse… 

My wife is terrified. I’m stressed as fuck. 

The cops show up at our house and come in and we’re quietly telling them about what happened. They said they’re going downstairs to talk to them, and they assured us they wouldn’t let them know that we reported anything. 

They go down, and they come back and give us a report. Apparently the guy had left… the woman told the police he was gone and wouldn’t be back. The police told us this and we were confused and shocked… but okay let’s see what happens. 

10 minutes later, the cop cars are still parked outside. We’re in the foyer of our house watching waiting for them to leave. When all of a sudden we hear a males voice coming from downstairs. 

No… multiple male voices. 

The cops had returned to our basement unit and were now speaking to the male guest. That’s right, he hadn’t left. He was hiding in the bathroom. 

For some reason, which the police wouldn’t tell us, they decided to go back to the unit and conduct a search. During their search, they found the male hiding in the bathroom. The woman lied to the police saying he was gone. He wasn’t. 

Turns out he was on probation, and was hiding because he didn’t want to get into trouble. The cops ended up speaking to them for 30 minutes. We overheard the guy saying to the police: 

“I fucking hate cops you know? I’ve been tazed, I’ve been shot with bean bags, so I didn’t want to see you.”

If he’s been tazed and shot with bean bags, sounds like he is a violent person. When the police returned to tell us the report, I asked if he was on probation for a violent crime. The police both looked at each other, hesitated, then told me they couldn’t share that info. 

But judging from their reaction, it seemed like my hunch was right. 

The police unfortunately couldn’t do anything at this point. They told us if anything else happens to call them, but for now the woman seemed very concerned about her Air BnB rating and was going to be chill apparently. 

My wife and I are spooked. She wants to go spend the night at her parents. I don’t want to be scared out of my own house leaving two strangers in my house alone, but I do understand her concern. 

Now at this point I should tell you, since 4:00 pm when the original commotion happened, we’ve been trying to get in touch with someone at Air BnB’s safety team to help us out. It’s now 8:30 pm, and FINALLY we were able to speak to someone who could help. 

I even tweeted about this to @airbnb to try and get through to someone: https://x.com/sepbaz/status/1839509041007169627?s=46&t=MtPVmiUJ2YFncCh028xvLg

Air BnB cancelled their reservation, and they agreed to leave. Meanwhile we’re thinking “They lied to the police, why not lie to Air BnB?”

I thought we were gunna have a squatter situation on our hands. 

Luckily, 30 minutes later they started packing up their truck. Oddly, they had soooooo much stuff with them. Multiple giant Tupperware containers full of stuff. Coolers, tons of bags. 

It honestly looked like they were moving out of our basement minus the furniture. 

They left by around 9:00 pm, and we breathed a sigh of relief - after I went downstairs to check the place out and saw that it wasn’t trashed that is. 

Our guess is that these people don’t have a fixed address. They have criminal records and can’t find housing, so they go from air BnB to air BnB spending 5 or so nights at each one. There was a lot of empty booze bottles left behind. So Im guessing they just get drunk or high or both and then get into violent fights.  

Upon looking at the guests air BnB profile again, we thought it was weird that she had stayed in so many local air bnbs. Her passport stamps were all cities around my municipality. 

Perhaps it’s important to host people with more international stays and not just local ones for this reason.

This was our very first air BnB hosting experience, and I don’t know if we have the stomach to do it again. 

We’ll see. ",8,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1fqods7/first_time_hosting_violent_domestic_dispute/,2024-09-27 13:59:13,Booking.com

Airbnb,Forced eviction and in need of urgent support,"Booked an Airbnb for 5 months in nyc for $30,000+ and 3 months into my stay the building surprises us with an eviction notice since our Airbnb host didn’t pay the bills. Asked to move out on 3 day notice. Airbnb has done nothing to help. This is absolute chaos.

Some details: 
Airbnb failed to find alternative housing and has refused to refund us for all of the unused nights of our stay (56 unused nights = $8134). It says directly in the policy that we should be refunded in this scenario (included at the bottom), as we were quite literally scammed by our host, who not only was hosting under a fake name for an apartment he wasn’t paying for, but has a warrant as well. I’m in shock Airbnb allowed this host on the platform in the first place, let alone still haven’t removed him. I’ve spent hours every week on the phone with Airbnb support, having to explain the situation repeatedly and continuously transferred to different ambassadors (Julian S, Rio, Viviana P, Gerardo J, Cesar, Mitch, Dahlia) with hardly any of them messaging me back afterwards. They have repeatedly closed support tickets. It seems like they’re actively trying to avoid helping me given how serious the situation is. 

How many ambassadors do I need to speak with to get someone’s attention? My roommates and I are university students and cannot pay our upcoming rent until we’re refunded. I’m so stressed about all the money lost and how to solve this, resulting in missing class and work. I’ve uploaded all the eviction papers to Airbnb, reached out on Twitter, even talking to attorneys.

This is my 22nd stay with Airbnb and I’ve never experienced anything like this. Airbnb staff shows no remorse for this nightmare my host has put me through and I desperately need to be refunded to avoid being homeless next month. 

If anyone has a contact at Airbnb or can offer any sort of advice/support, I would be extremely grateful.

Airbnb,"Fuck AirBnB, Honestly. Filthy Unheated Apartment, Terrible Host, and I Can't Get My Money Back Because of Made Up Reasons.","I have used AirBnB multiple times, but this is the last time. I booked a small apartment for a week in Europe with a friend. We were going to an expensive city and wanted to save money. The apartment seemed cute, but we rapidly discovered it was uninhabitable. The heat didn't work, in the dead of winter. The host came over to ""fix it"" which just involved him trying to gaslight me into thinking I wasn't actually cold because I'm a stupid American and I just don't understand Celsius and, oh, clearly I'm just confused because 8C is *different* from 8F and 8C is actually perfectly fine. Like I'm an idiot who can't use a fucking converter calculator on my phone. (8C is 46F, for anyone wondering.) 

It was late and we had nowhere else to go, so we stayed and just wore our coats to bed, not that we could sleep because it was actually in a kinda shitty neighborhood full of people screaming and yelling in the street below. Definitely not the ""cute upscale neighborhood"" that was promised.

In the morning, in the daylight (half the lightbulbs were just straight-up missing), we realized the place was filthy. The sheets, pillows and blankets, towels were all stained, threadbare, and smelly. The host suggested that I just wash everything myself because the apartment included a washer, but what the hell did I pay him a cleaning fee for, then? Nothing was cleaned! The comforter was stained and was far too big to fit in the washer anyway! We were finally able to secure a reservation for our dates, with early check-in, to a real hotel and immediately jumped ship and cancelled the rest of the AirBnB. The real hotel was amazing and I really wish we'd gone there from the start. It was actually one I was considering when I went with AirBnB to save money. I stupidly thought saving a grand was worth taking a chance. It wasn't and I ended up paying well over that ($1.5k) in the end anyway.

AirBnb is now saying that I'm not entitled to a full refund because I'm the one who initiated the cancellation and that somehow means I forfeit all my rights to a refund, even though it doesn't say that anywhere in their refund policy! I notified them within 24 hours of check-in, with proof, and cited them their own policies which say I am entitled to the refund, only to get ""I'm sorry, I can't help you"" over and over and over again, or they'd just shut the case abruptly. I went through a dozen reps in multiple different complaints over the course of a week trying to get someone who actually felt like honoring their own company policy and still only got 75% of the money back, with no compensation for the additional $1.5k the situation ended up costing me. They said that the only way I would get the rest back is to contact the host directly and just hope he feels like giving it back to me, which is bullshit and is also nowhere in their TOS. They're just making up shit at this point.

I gave up and just called my credit card company to dispute the charge. CC company had it done in 10 minutes and I just found out that I have trip insurance through them which may actually reimburse me for the additional money all this shit cost me. Never again will I cheap out on the hotel. I have learned my lesson. You get what you pay for. I will be booking a real hotel from now on.

Fuck you, AirBnB. I will get every cent of my money back if it kills me.

It's not even about the money anymore, it's just the blatant disrespect I've been shown by everyone in the process. I now understand why old rich kings went to war over being disrespected because, tbh, I'd sack Constantinople over some shit like this. No question.

Thank you for reading this rant. [Here is a picture of my cat in compensation.](https://imgur.com/a/5CY1zln)

Edit: Yes, I did research on the host beforehand. They were a ""Superhost"" with ~~4.6~~ 4.86 stars out of ~~like 350+~~ 321 reviews and they had full bookings months in advance. I also read a lot of the reviews and they were glowing, so I have no idea what happened there. The actual apartment itself was cute, but the host had obviously just not cleaned it from the previous guest(s) for whatever reason and the heater had become broken and, instead of taking accountability for that and making it right, which I would have accepted, he chose to gaslight me and dismiss me.

Also, yeah, I read AirBnB's TOS (apparently not all of it the first time) and yes, I am now aware cancelling was a mistake on my part, but I am still entitled to a refund under their TOS regardless and the only reason they are withholding it from me is because they just want to keep my money for doing nothing.

Airbnb,Airbnb changed our rating of a guest from 1-3 stars to all 5 stars. Can you trust guest ratings? [US],"\[UPDATE: The next morning, after seeing the comment by [ianzabel](https://www.reddit.com/user/ianzabel/), I rechecked the guests reviews, and lo and behold, the ratings now reflect those that I originally gave the guest. So issue resolved. (But I am curious why.)\]

\[Original post\]:

Had a guest check out and found extensive blood and/or dye stains on the (100% cotton) flat sheet, 3of4 pillowcases, 3 towels, hand towels, quilted bedspread, blanket, spare blanket (!), and hand towels. The fitted sheet from the linen set was nowhere to be found, replaced by a cheap 100% polyester set from Walmart.

I wrote an appropriate and very descriptive review of what we found. Gave her 3 stars overall (generous), 1or2 stars for cleanliness (can't remember exact), etc. She didn't write a review of us.

Today our review of her appeared, and although the text we wrote was there, it was all 5 stars for everything! Called Airbnb help, and they said unfortunately they couldn't fix the ratings. (Despite the ratings being quite obviously out of sync with the text of our review.) Our choice was to either live with it as is, or remove the review entirely. (She had 3 other reviews, all 5 stars.) Obviously leaving it up is better than removing it entirely; at least careful hosts might notice the problem.

Since she is a known quantity to us, she won't be able to book us again. But for other hosts, they will only be alerted to the problem if they read the texts of reviews. (And since she has all 5 star reviews, she'll be able to instant book anywhere she wants.)

I can't be sure this wasn't just a one-off glitch in Airbnb's system, but I will at least scan the text of reviews of future guests that have a 5 star average. At least for a while, I'm not trusting them.",4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1fd89wc/airbnb_changed_our_rating_of_a_guest_from_13/,2024-09-10 03:13:51,Booking.com
Airbnb,Host is demanding additional payment,"[I made a post about this very recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/14w8cqe/host_is_requesting_payment_for_damages/) but the situation has been complicated. 
 
In addition to the damages, the host also brought up that two people stayed in the listing, when it was only booked for 1 person. This is true, but it was an honest mistake. I did not pay attention to the guest amount, and it was set to 1 by default. Every correspondence since I first booked the place included the words ""we"" or ""us"", so I made it fairly clear that it wasn't just me coming, and yet he only brings this up now. So he is now looking to charge for this as well. 
 
I'm not too interested in ever using Airbnb after this experience, so I don't mind getting permanently banned from the website if that's what's necessary. I really don't want to give this guy any money. Should I contact Airbnb about the situation, or should I just ignore it altogether? Am I liable to get in any legal trouble for not paying this money?
 
EDIT: Some additional context. The listing was a small unit with a queen sized bed, easily suited for couples. During our stay, we didn't directly tell the host that the heat was unbearable, but we did request a fan, politely saying that the air did not circulate very well. The host responded the next day, denying our request, but thanking us for the feedback. At this point, we left quietly without communicating further, until the last day of our reservation. It was just to confirm that we had left. I did not tell them we left early, I wasn't planning on escalating anything until all this happened. 
 
The no A/C thing is not unusual for this country. Most airbnb's here probably wouldn't have one. Hell, most hotels don't have AC either. So, I wasn't surprised when we walked in and there wasn't one. However, it's also true that most living accommodations will be well ventilated, and there will be enough windows for sufficient air circulation.

Airbnb,"Host sets me up for a scam, and AirBnB support refuses to take action [Italy]","A few weeks ago, I was on a train trip through Europe ending in Italy. I wanted to have some very unique experiences, so I went with AirBnB to stay with some locals, meet some people, and have some fun. I'm on a train heading towards Italy, when the host asks if we can talk on WhatsApp - This has not been an issue before, so I go ahead and send them my number. Not long after, the host's mother begins texting me through WhatsApp - After I let them know I can't talk, they send me a very suspicious message in Italian. Below you'll find the chat logs, with redacted info.

[Chatlogs - Whatsapp](https://imgur.com/5Kc4XF0)

The Italian is a little too complicated for me, so I pop it through Google Translate:

[English Translation](https://imgur.com/MnsiJY1)

This is extremely suspicious, and I figure this is an obvious attempt by the host to essentially prime me for a scam. I don't believe for a second that there's hackers running around and cancelling random bookings, that's outlandish.

Essentially, the situation they're priming me for is that on the day of my arrival in a foreign city, they cancel my booking, I have no place to sleep, hotels are either fully booked or too expensive for a same-day booking to be feasible, but I can show up to the host and pay in cash, where they would very likely charge me more than what I intended to pay. In my opinion, the host chose to send me this message as soon as the full refund window passed.

This doesn't exactly appeal to me, and I'm not too keen on sharing a home with a host that's trying to scam me, even if they decide not to follow through with this. I contact support, give them the chat logs, and ask for a full refund since I feel like I don't want to get a partial refund for essentially avoiding a scam. However, I'm met with a lot of resistance from the support.

[Chatlogs - AirBnB Support](https://imgur.com/KDbhEia)

This is a fairly long and, honestly, frustrating read, but I'll summarize it quickly:

AirBnB refuses to acknowledge any of the contents in the message from the host. They meander, take a long time to respond, and seem to honestly not have any idea what the issue is. The only thing they are willing to do is to ask the host if they're willing to give me a full refund, which the host has absolutely no reason to do. Eventually, AirBnB support puts their foot down, and basically tell me that I need to cancel the booking, get a partial refund, and that I'm basically shit out of luck. This entire conversation took roughly six hours to reach a conclusion.

Eventually, and this is out of scope of the AirBnB chatlogs, I'm given a full refund as a ""goodwill"" gesture from AirBnB after I complained more, however, no action was taken against the host and **this host is still listed on AirBnB**, and is likely still pulling these scams. Not to mention I had to pay a great deal more in booking a hotel room.

Suffice to say, I am never using AirBnB again. I'll be telling all of my friends the same, and if anyone asks why, I'll just refer to this post.

Orignal post:

Who else agrees?

I was supposed to go to FL but it's in a state of emergency, so I canceled my booking. Policy is strict, free cancel within 48 hrs, otherwise 50% back. Booked this over half a year ago, so who'd known we'd be going through a pandemic.

Host refuses to budge on the policy. I called AIRBNB for a case manager. No help either, they said it's up to the host. I escalated it to the supervisor. No luck, bc FL isn't part of the stupid extenuating circumstances areas.

This is complete bs (sorry, I am frustrated after almost of week of calling and never getting call backs). It is NOT fair to be penalized for protecting ourselves from this coronavirus risk. Honestly, what pisses me off is that my days got rebooked by other people so it's not like the host is losing money from me.

As of now, AIRBNB lines are busy and I doubt I'll get any call backs as more states are getting more emergency annoucements. I've sent screenshots of news articles but also no response. I, like many others, deserve 100% refund.

I've also talked to countless others who were able to get a full refund with strict policy... maybe I'm just one of the few unlucky ones.

Edit: I’m sorry, I didn’t mean for this to be a back and forth btw guest vs host. I see both sides, believe me. I am disappointed in all parties but I’m emphasizing the need to broaden the extenuating circumstance policy bc the virus is in 110+ countries, not just 3. The US itself is #8 in the world with state of emergencies every day. It’s not fair for the host to lose all their bookings but AIRBNB should support them and guests more than ever than leave us in the dark. 

Also to those saying FL doesn’t have an official travel ban and I could have still went are missing the point by far lol. I’m young and healthy but this shit is serious.

Airbnb,Why would I owe $70 more (Occupancy Taxes Adjustment) if I change reservation from 5 guests to 4? [USA],"I'm about a month from my reservation in Denver. We had someone drop out so we're staying at 5 bdrm house with only 4 people. I don't want to be paying for more space than we need so I want to either find a 4bdrm house for less $$$ or, if possible, see if I can pay less if I remove a guest from our booking. When I go to change the reservation to 4 guests, before I make any changes, it already shows that I would owe $70 more if I make any changes. I played around with number of guests all the way up to the 8 guest limit but it still shows I would $70 more.  The kicker is that it says it specifies the reason as ""Occupancy Taxes Adjustment"".

overall saving 12% per rental might be worth it, just i worry that i don't get the same protections ex a renter decides they want to stay longer than their stay and not leave then what? 

overall im just getting a foot in the game and trying to see what app or platforms are worth getting to get more clients and save.

the plan would be get the rental on airbnb, vrbro, [booking.com](https://booking.com) and create my own site (still deciding this) then choose some worth it apps, to synch calendars maybe other recommendations?

Airbnb,"PSA! If you book a place, then on the day of check-in the host tells you “sorry, something came up, but I have this other place...” you are being SCAMMED.","I’ve seen guests inquiring about this type of situation a few times in this sub. [This Vice piece is one example of a particularly extensive US-based network run by what appears to be a single party.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/43k7z3/nationwide-fake-host-scam-on-airbnb) I’ve also read stories (probably on this sub) of people scammed in other countries than the US, so while the Vice piece focuses on a specific single American “property manager” running this scam, you should know it can happen anywhere. It’s an easy enough scam to pull off because it requires very little in the way of resources (you don’t even have to own the promised property, after all, and you can use pics from anywhere) and exploits travelers’ tendency to panic and look for a quick solution when exhausted, blindsided, and in unfamiliar surroundings.

To reiterate: If you book a specific property, and *all of a sudden* on the day of check-in, the property is suddenly “unavailable” because of some sort of emergency - but don’t you worry! The host conveniently has another place to put you up all ready to go! - don’t accept the change or alternate accommodations, immediately call AirBnB support, and keep escalating until they put you in suitable accommodations (on *their* dime - remember this is not your fault, but Airbnb’s fault for not properly vetting listings).

Airbnb,Vacasa Vacation Rentals on Airbnb,"\*\*\* Update - Due to the horrendous refund policy (even after just booking a few hours previously) we decided to go ahead with our stay. We would have lost nearly $750 at that point. And honestly, I was very surprised. The property was amazing, newly renovated, very well cared for, exactly as pictured and all amenities were true to the listing description. We encountered zero issues. However, after reading everyone's responses, I will be extra careful when booking in the future. Thinking it's just best for peace of mind to stay away from Vacasa. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Has anyone booked an Airbnb property hosted by Vacasa?

I just received an odd email from them after booking through Airbnb. The email address was very strange with a series of totally random letters and numbers that do not make sense @ host.airbnb.com  Asking me to click a link, sign a document, and then send it back to another email address.

Airbnb recommends not communicating outside the platform. And not click on any suspicious links. So I contacted Airbnb support. They said it was fine. That I can click and sign. I am so confused!!!!

I then looked up Vacasa on BBB and they have god-awful reviews and hundreds of complaints per month.

Has anyone dealt with them? Is this normal? Did I just waste a crap ton of money?

Airbnb,"Learned my lesson, next time I'll get my own travel insurance [Penticton, Canada]","A couple months ago I booked a small apartment on Airbnb in Penticton, British Columbia, so I could race at Ironman Canada at the end of August. The listing was only partially refundable up to a week before my arrival, so I paid for Airbnb's travel insurance (through Generali) because I was worried about the possibility of wildfires in the middle of summer (Ironman 70.3 Mont Tremblant had already been [canceled](https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/mont-tremblant-ironman-triathlon-rescheduled-for-late-august-1.6457794) earlier in the summer for that reason) and Airbnb specifically says you're 100% covered if ""you can't stay at the listing you booked due to a natural disaster"".

Sure enough, in the week before my trip, [several major wildfires broke out](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/british-columbia-residents-high-alert-wildfires-force-state-emergency-2023-08-19/) in the area around Penticton, which caused British Columbia to [declare a state of emergency](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023PREM0054-001323). That weekend, the province published [Ministerial Order 243/2023](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/mo/mo/m0243_2023), which [said](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2023PREM0054-001325):

> Under this order, effective today until end of day on Sept. 4, 2023, people may not travel to stay in temporary accommodations for non-essential purposes in several communities. This includes hotels, motels, inns, bed and breakfasts, hostels, RV parks, and campgrounds.

Based on that, I made the decision to cancel my reservation. After all, because of a natural disaster, I literally could not stay at the place I booked. Generali's policy defines ""natural disaster"" as ""a flood due to natural causes, tsunami, hurricane, tornado, earthquake, mudslide, avalanche, landslide, volcanic eruption, sandstorm, sinkhole, **wildfire** or blizzard"" (emphasis mine), and one of the covered events for trip cancelations is ""your Accommodations at the Destination made inaccessible by a Natural Disaster. For the purpose of this Covered Event, inaccessible means your Accommodations can not be reached by your original mode of transportation"".

So I started a claim, figuring that surely I'm covered, right? ...right?

No. They have an exclusion for ""travel restrictions imposed for a certain area by governmental authority"". It's a neat little loophole: there *was* a natural disaster, but because the government imposed travel restrictions as a response to the natural disaster... then the natural disaster is no longer covered. As a result, I'm out $1,300.

So, lesson learned: next time I'll get my own CFAR travel insurance instead of paying for Airbnb and Generali's insurance.

## Update

Thank you to those of you who mentioned Airbnb's [Extenuating Circumstances Policy](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1320). I had no idea it existed; Airbnb points you towards their travel insurance at every point, without mentioning this policy anywhere.

I reached out to support again, and as soon as I said ""extenuating circumstances"" on their chat, the automated system gave me a different phone number to call. I called immediately got a support agent. I explained the situation; she looked up my reservation and saw that I had purchased the travel insurance so she told me to start a claim with Generali, so I politely explained the whole thing and complained at length about Generali. She said she understood, apologized for the bad experience with this insurance company and put me on hold for a couple minutes to figure out next steps.

When she came back she told me she'd reach out to the host to ask them to refund me. A couple days later Airbnb let me know they'd be refunding me the reservation in full, and even gave me a $102 travel credit to cover the cost of the insurance itself. (As a bonus, Generali had the gall to send me a customer satisfaction survey; I didn't mince any words.)

I'm leaving this post up in case it's useful to anyone else, but my conclusion is still never *ever* use Airbnb's travel insurance.",54,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/166cb5w/learned_my_lesson_next_time_ill_get_my_own_travel/,2023-08-31 14:13:47,Booking.com
Airbnb,Insane additional terms agreement presented by host,"Hello,

Have been traveling non-stop for 12 months and usually book long-term stays for about 2-4 weeks. Reserved an expensive spot for February that had good reviews. The listing description said there was absolutely no smoking and additional terms for the rental agreement would be sent  to sign after reservation is made. High demand area and options were limited so I didn't think much of it since I don't smoke.

After booking, Host asks me for my e-mail right away. I provide right away. 2 months go by and they finally send the agreement, and oh boy, it's a doozy. If it turns out I'm not the asshole here, I'll post it and share more. Essentially it lays terms that result in me accept all damage, regardless of cause. Attorney fees are pre-defined, held harmless terms defined, and suspiciously the agreement is backdated to a date and time when I could have cancelled and received a full refund. Yikes.

I have a background in procurement, so reviewing contracts and rejecting specific terms or amending them is common to me. I pass along my amendments, which are minimal, and the host flips out. Gaslighting that I'm frustrated and ""never in all my years has anyone even questionsed these terms!"".

Okayyyyy, well, this should be an easy one for Airbnb to resolve. I provided nearly $4k to secure the dates, agreed to a security deposit of $500, and yeah I knew there was another contract coming but it sounds like a house rules policy in the listing. It was actually a 4-page contract that read more like an insurance policy. Whatever, a contract requires two parties to accept terms. They won't get my signature until the terms are acceptable.

I made an honest effort to come to terms. Airbnb took the hosts side, saying I knew about the terms before making the reservation. I've had two attorneys review this and they confirm this is how contracts work, that Airbnb+host are  in the wrong regardless of their internal policies and desires to keep my money. I'm literally asking Airbnb to provide someone from legal or someone with knowledge or credentials in contract law to review the case, and they are just offering me generic corporate propaganda like they are above the law, that I somehow agreed to signing a document that had terms never provided, and that they are very sorry I don't understand how their magical process works.

I know this can easily be disputed either by my credit card or in small claims, but what I fear is the precedent being set here. So I painted a very elaborate picture to the support team member. You know, something that truly illustrates the absurdity here.

""What if the terms of the rental agreement required me to commit a homicide. Would you still suggest I sign? Would I still be ineligible for a refund?"".

Turns out, Airbnb wouldn't refund you if your host offered these terms undisclosed and outside the cancellation policy. Because simply saying ""you will have to sign a rental agreement"" is enough to cover your ass no matter what the rental agreement terms are.

Airbnb cancelled the reservation on me 3 weeks before it would even start. My account says the guest cancelled it, but I didn't. They didn't care the host faked an email backdating to when they sent the policy. They literally just changed the time stamps and pretended falsifying information is no big deal.

So yeah. I won't be doing any more business through Airbnb.

Just another rant.

As the title states today we had the 3rd guest, out of 17 total, come to our front door to input their code for my ""Guest Suite"" apartment in in our private walk out basement expecting that they booked the entire home. I open the front door already knowing the mistake the guest has made - **FAILURE TO READ THE LISTING.**

So I open the door, met with a stunned look of confusion by the guest.

""Hi, are you looking for the Airbnb?""

""Oh yes I am.""

""Okay, well it is actually around the side of the house to the back where you will see the private entrance to the basement flat.""

\*I already know what's coming, the anticipation is almost too much to handle!\*

\*Maintain your professionalism\*

""I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, unfortunately you'll have to contact Airbnb support if there is an issue regarding a refund. I will let you know that the listing hasn't changed since you've booked and it is outlined numerous time that this listing is for the entire private walk out basement. In the meantime while you call Airbnb please feel free to go down to the space as everything is set up for your stay and your booking is still valid.""

I see a lot of guests here with complaints and grievances against Airbnb and their hosts. While, I see some that are clearly outrageous and I feel bad for the guests, I cannot help to think that if I'm experiencing issues with folks simply not reading, then there has to be other hosts that have experienced similar problems.

If a guest isn't reading because they expect their Airbnb to be a ""hotel experience"", in a home or apartment, that is on them. I always make mention of this in any post I do here or on r/AirBnBHosts \- ***AirBNBs are not a 1 for 1 exchange or match for a hotel, they are each a unique alternative!*** If you're expecting hotel service read the listing and make sure your Airbnb is described as hotel service or, simply book a hotel.

My space is plentiful in SQ FT compared to any hotel you'll get, the TV is bigger then any hotel you'll get, the cookware and kitchenette are nicer then any hotel you'll get, and the community is quieter then any hotel you'll get (I'll save the rest for a surprise for when you book).

I went through their authentication process (admittedly, I look a bit different from my ID, long/short hair & no messy beard do a lot) and today I got a mail saying my account was removed due to fraudulent activity.

also, I was scrolling through the sub to see any similar issues and saw that there was an unreasonable amount of ""0"" votes on posts. This doesn't happen naturally on any sub, it means someone is actively going through all (negative) posts and downvoting them (I upvoted back ofc).

Airbnb,Is automated@airbnb.com legit or scam email address to fish for credit card numbers? [FIN] ,"I booked a trip last sunday using my credit card. Now I got email from [automated@airbnb.com](mailto:automated@airbnb.com) saying:

  
""Visa XXXX valid

You can now use the Visa XXXX card to book trips and experiences on Airbnb."" 

and a button saying ""BOOK YOUR NEXT TRIP"" (i changed numbers to X's but the card numbers matched my credit card).

  
I have used the same card previously and haven't changed anything since. Is that address legit and just some random message or scam attempt to click the button and getting redirected to scamsite? (didnt press it)

 Airbnb lists @airbnb.com as legit address on its site but I have not made any changes to my payment methods or anything so it seems sketchy they would email me all of a sudden and I found this article from 2016 saying that address might not be trusted?

Airbnb,This is why I am leaving Airbnb as a host,"\[UPDATE\]

I took the advice of someone who messaged me privately and emailed the CEO and executive team of Airbnb.  Shortly after my case was resolved with Airbnb canceling the booking from the guest's end, which means the guest lost all their money.  

&#x200B;

However, the guests have refused to leave so I have a new problem that I anticipated.  I am less worried about this.  I know what my options are and most likely I'll have to take a deep breath and wait for them to leave.  I've learned from this experience that when you need REAL support from airbnb in a crisis, expect to go through hell.  The cost of this experience on my stress and lost productivity is not worth it.  From now on, I will USE Airbnb instead of being used by them.   Good luck out there.  

&#x200B;

For those of you that asked about other options than Airbnb here is what I recommend:  If you are serious about investing a lot of time in your rental you can use a site like [littlehotelier.com](https://littlehotelier.com) to set up your own Bed and Breakfast.  Full disclosure I don't have personal experience with them but have talked to others that left airbnb for their own private BnB listing and are fully booked.  The other advantage is that they have been able to sneak past the short-term rental restrictions in Los Angeles.  

&#x200B;

The other option is to connect with a local church or synagogue that has a big community and advertise to their community.  Find local FB groups and advertise through them.  Just remember you are going it alone so you will need to make sure you have all your safety nets, legal docs, and lease arranged.

Original Post

I bought my beautiful duplex 3 years ago.  In Los Angeles this is no small accomplishment.  My wife and I own 1 property and we love it.  We decided to use Airbnb to rent the upstairs while we live in the downstairs.  It has been mostly a great experience and Airbnb was great to work with through some of the small issues that came up from time to time. We earned dozens of great reviews. We become superhosts and we had a lot of confidence in Airbnb as a supportive platform that will be there when we need them.

Boy was I wrong!

After two years of renting we got our first guests from hell.  They paid for 4 and brought 7 which would have cost significantly more. The guests were well aware of our policy beforehand.  When we tried to speak with them nicely to resolve the issue, they threatened us.  Needless to say, I was livid and wanted these people out.  I thought Airbnb would be there to help us.  Again, boy was I wrong!

We have been out through customer support hell.  Here's the gist of it: -They make promises that sounds sincere, like "" we will call you back within an hour"" and they never ever call back. -They assign you a case manager and then 2 hours later their shift is over and someone new takes over that doesn't call you or have any clue what's going on. -They don't respond to their texts -They say they will take action in x amount of time and they don't -You have to call repeatedly and go over your story with the next agent who takes 30 minutes to finally understand the problem -When they finally understand and promise to resolve you hang up happy and then nothing happens.

This list goes on longer than I care to write.  I'm done with airbnb.  But since they've screwed me I'm going to screw then back.  Every guest that requests to book I'm going to take off platform until I get banned. In the meantime I'm going to use smaller but friendlier b&b sites.  I already get lots of off platform requests from an email list I'm part of.  I will share any info for other hosts who are sick of Airbnb.

I always thought people where whiners about Airbnb and now I know. I apologize to you all.  They lost a true fan.  I know I must be among thousands who are sick of them.  I look forward to doing my little part to sabotage them in whatever little way I can.",117,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/p3ieis/this_is_why_i_am_leaving_airbnb_as_a_host/,2021-08-13 07:07:26,Booking.com
Airbnb,Hidden security system with camera/microphone. I’m not sure how to react. [USA],"Staying in a remote location that I’ve stayed at previously and really enjoyed. It’s also conveniently located near my elderly family members I’m visiting. This stay, I noticed behind the couch a security system similar to a tablet device with a camera. I looked up the device online and found that it also has a microphone and has audio recording capabilities.

I’m uncomfortable but unsure if I’m overreacting or underreacting.  It is clear that the camera was not pointed in a way that could record any video footage but obviously the microphone could. This is an interior device that is not disclosed booking. However it is also clearly a security system. 

I did contact AirBnB who gave me a few options such as a new booking and hotels (there is nothing near this location as near convenient.) I am currently considering my options. Should I stay or immediately go? I’m just confused here and trying to be logical. I’m an overthinker.  My husband seems to think I’m overreacting as it’s clearly a security system and doesn’t seem nefarious. Any advice on how to handle this?

Edit: Attaching photos to security system. Yes it was plugged in and functioning. [https://imgur.com/a/wfRMDLJ](https://imgur.com/a/wfRMDLJ)",17,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1d49x6m/hidden_security_system_with_cameramicrophone_im/,2024-05-30 17:49:40,Booking.com
Airbnb,"Plaid ""payment verification""","So today out of the blue while booking an AirBnB I was prompted to verify my payment information with Plaid. This was weird seeing as I had booked a couple others yesterday no problem. Matter of fact, I have booked almost 800 nights totaling close to $100k on this credit card over the last three years.

I figured whatever I would go through the process and clicked continue. I was prompted to log into my bank...where Plaid requested access to _all transactions for all accounts for all time_ (retirement accounts, mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, bank accounts, etc..._everything_) ...wtf?? There is no way I am going to grant this access to ""verify my payment method"". I denied the access request which canceled the verification process and prevented me from booking.

I decided to open a support request to see if I can get an exception figuring AirBnB wouldn't want to lose a customer over this. Well I was wrong, support claims the verification process is ""good for me"" and to ""make sure I don't get scammed"" which doesn't make any sense and offered no way around it other than to use PayPal which I am not interested in doing.

I ended up going over to Vrbo instead and found the exact same place for the same price and booked there. 

I am pretty sure this is just a way for them to make some money (or get a service for cheap/free) in exchange for farming customer transaction data. Even anonymized this data is quite valuable. If the service was legitimately just verifying the credit card limits/balances/etc it only would have requested access to this information. Since it requested unrestricted access to all of my accounts and data types it is clearly just trying to farm data.

Now, my financial department in Poland would not refund my stay, and the host will not generate an invoive for me. I also tried to contact airbnb support but they weren't helpful.

Airbnb,Nightmare Guests Making False Accusations for a Refund. Is this a trend? [USA],"Before the guests arrived, they were trying to cancel their booking because an event they were in town to attend was cancelled. My property manager declined their refund request and once they arrived, the guests were trying to identify any minutiae to justify a refund through AirBnb. The guests complained that the house is rundown and is in a ""ghetto"" neighborhood (among other bogus/ offensive complaints). The house (although located in Newark, NJ) is in a prestigious, federal historic district where houses sell for $650K at the absolute lowest end to $1.5M. These complaints ranged from frivolous at best to outright lies at worst.

Complaints:

-House is rundown and unlivable

-HVAC/ Air conditioning doesn't work and the indoor temperature is 90 degrees

-Staircase feels like its unstable and will cave in

-There is a crack on the bottom of the staircase and dining room ceiling beams are unpainted

Here are some recent photos taken of the property: [https://www.airbnb.com/slink/qpv02dGA](https://www.airbnb.com/slink/qpv02dGA)

Airbnb,Host requiring us to sign contract saying they can substitute another house?,"We found a beautiful house on the beach with a pool and plan to stay for 10 days.

After booking and the host accepting the booking, they now state we are required to sign a 13-page contract.  The contract is pretty basic except for two things:

* a paragraph that states they have the right to replace the property with a similar property
* they want our credit card details on the contract in case of damages, excessive cleaning and ""other applicable fees per the rental agreement herein"".

The part of the contract I'm most concerned with states:

`Accommodation Modification: You agree that the rental unit reserved by you is fungible with similar units. A ""similar unit"" is within a 5-mile radius, a similar distance from the beach, and available amenities, and sufficient occupancy to accommodate you and your guests. If you unit becomes unavailable other than because of your own acts or omissions or force majeure, the property manager may place you in a similar unit or refund all amounts paid by you for unused portions of your stay, at the property manager's sole discretion.`

Is this allowed per AirBnb's rules?  I'm nervous this is a bait and switch and we're going to get to the beach destination and be stuck.  Does anyone have any advice for me?

UPDATE: Thanks everyone.  I read the [link provided](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/465/if-a-host-asks-you-to-sign-a-contract) by a Redditor and read that the host is required to state the contract upfront.  I also went and read the listing a few more times.  I see no details in the listing as to the contract wording but in the ""Trip"">""Things to Know"", they dumped all the contract wording there, including this section about accommodation modification.  Also under ""Where you're staying"", they state ""By booking this house you agree to the following contractual terms...."" and list them again.

There were two other homes we were considering by other hosts and they are still available.  I'm just worried we won't get our money back on this one if we refuse to sign and be on the hook (it was several thousand dollars). Slightly stressful.  I wonder if AirBnB ever imagined/intended this could be such a stressful process.

ANOTHER UPDATE: It took us all morning, but we were able to get the booking cancelled and refunded in full. No help from the host.  It's taken us hours and stress to deal with this.  We are now scrambling to find accommodations at the last minute.  I'm also disheartened because I've read 100 other beach listings since last night and see MANY hosts put contract terms in the listing itself and don't pull this shady business of making you sign afterwards.  Also, as you all eluded, NO ONE mentions an ""accommodation modification"".  Such BS.

After it was cancelled, I was NOT able to leave a review which is disheartening as I feel the need to warn other renters.   I'm disclosing the listing and calling out the company below for other renters that might be googling in hopes that this shady company change their shitty practices.

**Host:** Southern Holiday Homes

FINAL UPDATE: we are on our way to our new vacation destination.  It took many hours to find a new house but in the end we found a beautiful property on VRBO.  While looking for a second rental, I was quite frustrated and called Airbnb citing three violations with all 28 listings of Southern Holiday Homes that Airbnb let stay up on the site.  I said “all listings have the same 3 problems and you are letting them ruin other renters’ vacations as we speak.  How can you do this to your users?” They said they would check into it and offered us a $1000 credit.  Sadly, we found the prices and experience of VRBO so much better, we rented there.

Airbnb,Hosts: please think about the impact on guests of the cleaning and laundry products you use,"I, like many others, have allergies to artificial fragrance found in conventional cleaning products like Tide, Febreeze, Lysol, Fabuloso, etc.   my particular allergies are severe enough to make me have to cancel my stay if the place I’m staying exposes me (think constant migraine, diarrhea, breathing problems).  

I always have a conversation with a prospective host of a listing I’m looking at before I book, about what cleaning and laundry products they use.  I’ve been lied to in the past and had to immediately leave, and then fight with Airbnb to get my money back all while scrambling to find a new place to stay.  

Conventional cleaning products are terrible for the environment as well as for the health of you and your guests.  There exist many alternatives that are fragrance free, made from organic materials (like Seventh Generation or ECOS), and work just as well.   If cost is a concern there are many natural, unscented Cleaners available in bulk at Costco, or you can also use diluted vinegar, baking soda, washing soda, and 3% peroxide to clean everything in your home and do your laundry.  

Allergy sufferers have been petitioning Airbnb to include filters for this kind of thing for years.  This is an accessibility issue, just like wheelchair accessibility is.  So far nothing has changed, so I’m hoping some of you will see this post and decide to do something about it yourselves.

Please think about the impact that products you or your cleaning service uses are having on children, the elderly, chronically ill, and other vulnerable guest populations.   If you use a cleaning service, don’t assume they will use safe hypoallergenic products even if they claim to: please ask for specific brands they use, or better yet buy your own products and tell them to use what you’ve provided.

If more of you would do this, advertise what products you use, and petition Airbnb to include this as an accessibility issue in their filters, I’m sure the 30% of people with fragrance and other related environmental allergies will reward you with more of their business.  I hate staying in hotels, but I do now after being burned by Airbnb hosts too many times: at least the head of housekeeping at a hotel is going to be able to tell me what they clean the rooms with.

Airbnb,Guest Damaged Fiber Line (Internet) Resulting in Cancelations... Now What?,"Had a guests stay with us for 4 nights that was very friendly until late on last night before checkout I got this aggressive message: [https://imgur.com/a/Kd8HNba](https://imgur.com/a/Kd8HNba)

As you can see my husband responded within a few minutes, and we sent several follow up messages and even offered to send any credit provided by our ISP to the guest, but the messages above were the last messages received from the guest. My husband stayed up late that night with our ISP customer service, then spent hours over the next couple days trying to resolve it for the next guest, but could not get it working. They were not able to get a technician out for a week, resulting in a cancelation of a booking worth over $1000 that we were not able to rebook which was the worst part of this situation.

Ultimately when the tech arrived, he noticed that the fiber box clips that hold the face of the box on the wall mount were broken off on one side ([https://imgur.com/a/4uDpySJ](https://imgur.com/a/4uDpySJ)), and only hanging on by 1 clip on the other side. He said most likely someone broke the face off thus damaging the very sensitive tiny fiber cable connected inside. He replaced the box and cut out the damaged part of the fiber line and the internet is working fine again.

The guest also left the place quite a mess with crumbs in every room including the upstairs bedrooms. My cleaner also sent me this photo ([https://imgur.com/a/QGosYby](https://imgur.com/a/QGosYby)) Of 2 soaked towels on the floor of the tub in a pool of yellow liquid. She said she didn't want to touch it, and left the the shower on for awhile to rinse it away. The guest left a review, but I haven't yet so I can't see it. I am approaching the review deadline in a few days so what should I say and how many stars would you give them? Also in terms of filing a report for cleaning and cancelation due to damaged internet do I have a case?

**TLDR;** It looks like maybe one the guests kids broke the fiber internet, and either the parent knew or didn't know, and accused me of blocking the internet on the last night resulting in $1000+ in cancelations from future guests.",8,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/13cxhoc/guest_damaged_fiber_line_internet_resulting_in/,2023-05-09 15:57:58,Booking.com

I find this very deceptive. If you say your house has 3 bedrooms and holds 6 people, the price shown should be for 3 bedrooms and 6 people, not 2 people.

Airbnb,You'll never believe the reason hosts make up damages claims.,"Follow up to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/11u2fl0/host_held_my_girlfriend_and_i_against_our_will_at/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1) post.

It’s quite simple: If a host reports damage and then the guest writes a negative review, the host can get it taken down as “retaliatory.”

I wish I were kidding.

I just found out my negative review was taken down because they determined it was retaliatory.

*""In this case we have determined that the reason why the review was removed is because the reason why you put the review is due to the report received in the listing.""*

They made this determination despite me raising issues with the apartment several times throughout the stay, before the host alleged any damages.

Despite Airbnb ultimately ruling in my favor on the damages claim.

And despite my review not mentioning anything related to the host’s allegations.

Be careful when booking an Airbnb with no negative reviews. They were likely deleted.

Better to search for Airbnbs with negative reviews and see how the host responds to them.

Oh, did I mention that Airbnb refused to delete the host’s negative review of me?

This despite them not saying a single negative thing about me to Airbnb until after I reported them to Trust & Safety after they held my girlfriend and I hostage and demanded hundreds of dollars to let us leave.

I guess continuing to get income from hosts comes before everything… even safety?

Airbnb,"Host messaged me out of nowhere needing additional verification, threatening to cancel reservation [Spain]","I booked a weeklong stay at an Airbnb months ago, we’re scheduled to go there mid-July. Everything went fine with the reservation, but the host just messaged me stating that “upon further review, additional verification is required” and sent me a suspicious looking URL and said that if I do not do this verification within 1 hour, he will cancel our reservation. I went to the domain of the url he sent and it redirected me to booking.com

Airbnb,Host asking to message outside of Airbnb - should I be concerned? [USA],"Hi folks, just want to get a gut check from people who book airbnbs more often. I booked a place in Santa Fe, NM. The specific property only had 2 reviews but the host had 100+ reviews total for a couple of other properties.

After booking and the host confirming the booking, I got a text asking for my email for email communications (copy and pasted below). I've never encountered this before - should I be concerned?

&#x200B;

Here is the host: [https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/494536365](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/494536365). Below is the message:

We will text you to let you know when your property is ready for check-in on or before 4pm on 4/29/24. If you need anything until then, you can reply here. We suggest setting a contact for 'SkyRun Santa Fe' on this phone number so you'll know how to reach us.

Airbnb,Can added guests WITHOUT Airbnb accounts read and respond in the chat conversation [USA],"UPDATE: Turns out, this feature is coming this summer (2024). All guests are now part of the chat and can respond. [https://www.airbnb.com/release/host](https://www.airbnb.com/release/host) But I still don't know if people who don't know how people without an Airbnb account are added to the booking. via email/text and a link that doesn't requiring signup? Perhaps.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

When the person booking adds a second, third, or more guests to the list, but those additional guests DON'T have an Airbnb account, what features are sent to them and how does the process work? Do they add a guest with an email account, or do they just get a shareable link to use?

And then what can that non-airbnb guest do with that email or link? I figure they see the check-in and out date and times, arrival info, checkout info... But are they part of the chats too? (I am a host that has no upcoming trips, so I can't test this myself at the moment.)

I want to encourage guests to add, at minimum, a second guest to the list so they don't miss any chats. But I don't know if chats are accessible to that person. And the guest might say correctly that no one else in their group has an Airbnb account. But maybe that's not required to have?

Sometimes I have guests who are simply bad at reading the chats we send. I want to keep all the communication in the platform, but some people mentally check out once they have booked. I've had 8 guests in a party once but only the lead person included as the guests, and that person never read any helpful chats we sent after (including door codes that caused another guest to be locked out), leaving the other 7 guest in the dark.",3,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1c34pzz/can_added_guests_without_airbnb_accounts_read_and/,2024-04-13 15:35:36,Booking.com

Airbnb,(Help) Hosts charges $700 for “additional fees” 72hrs before booking,"I booked a stay 1 month ago to stay at a condo in a resort in Florida, United States. Last night I got a request for $700 from the host for resort fees. 

Here is her [house rules and message from Airbnb support](https://imgur.com/a/KBmu6lZ)

I was unaware of the fees and caught off guard. The Airbnb mediator called me and informed me that since it was in the house rules she can charge whatever she pleases. I told him that she did not message me 7-10 days prior so I am declining the fees (as per instruction of the AirBnb representative)

I would like a 100% refund or just be able to stay at the location. Has anyone dealt with anything similar or have any advice?

Thank you!

EDIT: Airbnb gave a full refund ~~as this is against their policy for house rules. Mainly what I got was that hosts can’t put a ludicrous range on there and expect the money within 72 hours~~

Edit: just to reiterate so that hopefully this will help someone in the future. From what the mediator told me, hosts are allowed to charge whatever they want in the house rules. When you book a stay you are agreeing to their rules and fees. The ONLY reason that this was refunded to me was because they did not request the money 7-10 days prior. It is a ridiculous policy but I guess that’s what it is.

Airbnb,"Host wanted to cancel my room over 4th of July due to ""repair work"", saw the whole property up on booking for the same dates. [USA] ","*Tl;dr:* host wanted to cancel on me due to repair work having to take place but I found the property up on another site for the same dates. When I further inquired (without specifically mentioning what I had found), the situation suddenly resolved itself and the repair work (why would you schedule repair work on your airbnb on 4th of July) could be moved. What the hell was going on?? 

Ok so the situation has been largely resolved at the moment but I still wanted to share and get some opinions. 
Last weekend I get a message from this room in a house that I booked on the oregon coast for three nights over fourth of July. The message said that they had to cancel my reservation due to some ""repair work"" that needed to be done, but they'd assist me in finding a new accommodation. At this point it was 2am where I'm at, so I didn't think much further and just write back that it wasn't ideal, if course, and I'd be happy about some assistance since finding something over 4th of July on a budget is a pain. 


Then she sent me this message ""I did not cancel your reservation and I won’t do so until either I can get the dates moved from the contractor or I can get you placed in a similar accommodation.""

Which is nice and all but I still wasn't sure what to make of it and went to bed. 


The next day I had a look around the booking sites and of course the options were getting very scarce, much worse than when I initially booked the place almost two months ago. But what really got my attention was that on Airbnb, the property that rented out my room still had some cheaper rooms up for my dates. And the kicker was, on Booking.com, I found the whole property (a big house) being rented out during my dates. 


So I get back to her and tell her that I've had a look and that the options weren't great, and to feel the situation out a bit more I then asked whether I understood correctly that they had to close *the whole property* during my dates (at this point I also realised how stupid it would be to schedule your ""repair work"" over the fourth of July, wow). 

To this, I then received the following answer (if you can call it that):


""Thank you for reaching out. I am pushing out the construction work so you are secure at my place for the holiday! Sorry for the stress"" 

I now checked and the house isn't up on booking anymore. 


So what the hell was the host trying to do here? And should I book a backup motel or something in case they are going to try something again? The whole encounter left me pretty suspicious of this property, what do you think?

Airbnb,Co-Travelers included in Booking can build up their Reviews too?[USA],"I only deduced this by seeing duplicate reviews for 2 of my co-guests, and not 100% verified, but it appears that if a guest invites another guest along as what Airbnb is calling *Co-Travelers*, not only can they see all the details of the stay and can also share in the in-app group conversation, but now I think I learned yet another reason guests should be including their co-guests/co-travelers. The co-travelers will build up their own reviews and ratings *with* the Booker.

This makes sense, because otherwise it would be unfortunate for friends who travel together for only the main guest/booker to receive the review and stars. Can you imagine 10 guests, all Airbnb users, but only one reaps the reward? In this theoretical group dynamic, each guest would only be receiving reviews for 1/10th of their stays. Quite unfortunate.

I have been letting guests know that they can and should include their friends so that things like door codes, or updates, details, etc can be received by more than 1 of them. We had one guest never share the door code, and when the friends came home without them, couldn't get in. I am trying to avoid dumb stuff like that.

But now I think there is a *real and legitimate* reason for them to include extra travelers. If they are generally great guests, they all share in receiving the potential 5.0 stars; a great way to climb faster. And as an added bonus, there may even be a small psychological/peer pressure effect that causes guests to not break rules or damage things, as it is a shared experience now.

What do you guys think? Have you noticed this feature? I don't see the shared-reviews documented anywhere in Airbnb. [https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/3555](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/3555) . If my understanding of it is correct, I personally think it is quite a clever usage for both hosts and guests.

Airbnb,I booked a stay that was listed in the wrong country [Nicaragua],"Has anyone else had this issue?

I needed last minute accommodation. 

I opened AirBNB app and searched for the town I am in in Nicaragua. Then using the map I found a bunch of options and booked the one I thought was the best. 

On the map search it appeared 3km from where I was but when I headed over in the morning I couldn’t find the location the host sent me. Which is when I realised the stay is actually located in Argentina!

Because Argentina is mentioned in one tiny spot above the map of Nicaragua, AirBNB don’t want to refund me. 

I booked it the day before and found out before check in. They told me not to cancel and so now I’ve paid the full amount and they don’t want to refund me.

RESOLVED!

Thanks for your tips. 

I had two more service people review and refuse a refund. 

Then I followed advice to tweet about it and an hour later I had a refund.

Airbnb,At what point does it become acceptable to ask for a refund based on bad internet?,"The AirBnB I am staying at now is a 30 day booking. I am on day 29. The internet has not worked at all for 15 of the days. I need the internet because of my work. I understand for this booking it is too late to request on and I don't plan on it. I'm just trying to come in prepared for future bookings and wondering what is the rule of thumb? Or better yet, what is AirBnB's policy on the matter? At what level is a refund appropriate.

If I ask for a speed test and they show 100 up/down but then I get there and it's 90 up/down, surely I don't expect a refund. But if they say it's 100 up/down and I get there and it's 1 up/down or sometimes doesn't work at all, would that justify a refund? If so, how much?

Airbnb,Host Wants Us to Cancel Even Though They Lied & Kicked Us Out...Are We Wrong Here? Do We Deserve a Full Refund?,"Hello Everyone, this is a long and nuanced one.  We're just looking for advice and help.  We feel like our hosts are completely insane and Airbnb support is willfully negligent but we are looking for third parties to verify or refute.

**Background**

My girlfriend and I booked a long-term stay (\~2.5 months) back in early March for mid-June through early-September.  The place said it was pet-friendly, although the house rules asked for a ""*well-behaved and friendly dog (we do not allow any dog who is aggressive to either people or other animals in anyway, including lunging, loud barking or growling) who is trained to follow the rules below is allowed with an additional pet fee of $50. Payment of this fee will be requested separately through air b and b. Pets are not permitted on the furniture or beds and guest agrees to pay an additional cleaning and/or repair fees associated with failure to comply. If your pet is not able to be in the in the space quietly and comfortably when you are away (i.e. minimal barking or jumping up on the furniture) you will either need to take them with you at all times, or we unfortunately cannot accommodate you. If your dog is kennel trained, we can loan you a kennel during your stay.*""  It said any violation of this would allow the hosts to kick us out and charge us $300.  We did not have our puppy at the time of booking, we picked up a new puppy just before arriving to the Airbnb.  However, it is a Bernedoodle (smart, highly-trainable breed) and we paid to get it trained for a month from age 2 months to age 3 months before we picked her up.  We figured that with her training and our ability to adapt that we would be able to have a ""well-behaved"" dog who fits the description.  We told the hosts we were bringing a dog, and they were cool with that.  We did not specify ""puppy"" but also did not intentionally withhold that.  We thought ""pet-friendly"" meant as such.

It is also worth mentioning that we are fully nomadic, in other words we live at long-term Airbnbs and have been doing so without issue for the past 13 months.  We have a car jam-packed with our stuff and a rooftop bag.  Moving from one location to another is a lot of work.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **Day 1:** we check in late at night, do not see hosts.
2. **Day 2:** we meet the husband host (hereby known as Husband Host).  He meets our puppy and asks her age.  We tell him she's 3 months old.  He seems fine with it.  The wife host (hereby known as Wife Host) is away for the week.
3. **Days 2-7:** we unpack everything and set up our lives.  It's a ton of work.  We join a local gym.  We find out they don't have air conditioning as advertised but instead they have temperature-controlled floors that are fairly ineffective.  Temperature never gets below 70 and is usually at 73-75 which is uncomfortable for us and difficult to sleep in.
4. **Day 8:** Wife Host and Husband Host come by our place and tell us that they have a ""no puppy"" rule and that they took a lot of time to write up their description and that we should have let them know we were bringing a puppy, and that they want us to leave, but that they'll let us stay a little while to find new accommodations.  They are very concerned for their ""very expensive floors and furniture.""  We tell them that a week in she has been entirely non-destructive to furniture or floors, and that the only issue is that she is peeing on the rugs.  She was housebroken by her trainer on indoor pee-pads so it ended up taking her a week to adjust to a new environment and to outdoor potty time.  We ask is there anything we can do to mitigate their concerns, including payment for any damages.  They say it's not about money and that they want us to leave and that's the only option.  We are both confused because we don't remember seeing anything about a no puppy rule, but maybe we missed it, so we say that we'll talk about it and let them know what we're going to do next.  We check the listing and it turns out there is a ""no puppy"" rule, not in the house rules but in the house description space which is about 4 pages long and this text is toward the bottom.  We are mildly suspicious that they made up this rule and put it on the listing after realizing we brought a puppy, but in the meantime we assume responsibility.  We start looking on Airbnb and VRBO for alternative options for long-term stays in the area that are somewhat immediately available, but there is nothing remotely within our price range, and everything is booked for a few weeks out at the minimum anyway.  We call Airbnb immediately and explain the situation.  We tell them that we feel a bit left out to dry...kicked out a week into a 2.5 month stay after we drove across the country with all of our stuff to get there, and ask them if they can help us find/afford new accommodations.  Airbnb tells us that they will try to help and they create a case.
5. **Days 8-11:** we keep calling and messaging Airbnb and get almost no response.  Everyone on the phone says they can't connect us to the right person handling our case.  On Day 10 we find out that no one has been assigned to our case yet, still.  Seems like it got sent to the wrong department or something.  On Day 10-11 we write up a letter to the hosts and my girlfriend stays up all night baking them cookies.  The letter does the following 1) apologizes for us misreading their rules and the resulting discomfort we caused, 2) begs them to let us stay with a list of potential issues with a puppy and how we feel we can mitigate them, and again offering financial compensation, and 3) we say that ultimately we do not want to cause them any trouble so if the answer is still no then we respect that and will get out of their way ASAP and no hard feelings.  No response.  On Day 11 we find out that the original listing when we booked said nothing about puppies, age limits, or housebroken rules.  Now we're pissed off and REALLY need Airbnb to help us out, whether by pushing back on the host or by finding us a new place to stay.
6. **Day 12:** The host sends us a copy of a message they sent to Airbnb: ""*we specify that we only friendly, well-behaved dogs over the age of 2 (no puppies or older dogs who do not have good bladder control)- it is ridiculous that they assumed that they could buy a new puppy and train it in our home. It is completely unacceptable that they think it is ok to bring an animal who will poop and pee in the house, potentially chew on and damage the furniture). Our dog just turned 1 year old so we just finished training a dog and went to a lot of effort to protect the floors and furniture for the first year. we've had many dogs and have had them professionally trained as well as trained them ourselves and every dog has accidents and ruins thing no matter how carefully you watch them. When we confronted them about the puppy, who is 12 weeks old, they claimed that they had it professionally trained (that is just ludicrous it routinely takes at least 16-20 weeks to fully house train a dog, and even then they will still have frequent accidents for several months after). we asked them if they had ever had a puppy before and they said as children (i.e. their parents trained them) and assured me that she was cleaning up after the dog when it has accidents. THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT, WE DO NOT WANT A DOG IN OUR HOME THAT WE ARE NOT DIRECTLY SUPERVISING HAVING ACCIDENTS.Even if this was not in direct violation of our rules, no normal, polite and considerate person would ever take a new puppy into someone else's home without permission and expect that they would be ok with the dog having accidents in their home. We have a very nice, expensive home with concrete floors and lots of custom made furniture. It is completely unacceptable that air b and b is dragging their feet in addressing this situation. I will only assume that you are willing through your insurance policy to pay the 10's of 1000's of dollars it will cost to have the floor refinished to remove all trace of urine odor. we did not even allow our own puppy in that space until she was potty trained, i cannot believe we are being forced to endure an inconsiderate, sneaky guest who claims that they did not know the rules and now expect that is their problem that they cannot find another spot to stay that will allow them to have a new puppy (any normal person who cares for their home would not allow this, so i'm not surprised that they are having a hard time finding another place.*""  We don't understand what happened or why the hosts would accuse us of deceit, sneakiness, or why they would react negatively to our letter at all.  In a later direct conversation Wife Host tells us that after reading our letter they were convinced we would not leave, even though our letter explicitly states that we will and ""no hard feelings.""  In retrospect, it is our belief that from the moment they learned we brought a puppy that they thought that we willfully deceived them, and as a result everything that followed they chose to believe nothing that we said.  The hosts tell us they want us out by **Day 15**, and we say that we want to leave ASAP but we don't have anywhere to go and that we want to work this through Airbnb and are waiting for them to get back to us.  We are calling Airbnb like crazy people multiple times a day and messaging nonstop, to no avail.  We're scared to talk directly with the hosts again.
7. **Day 13:** The hosts threatens legal action, and we go to a hotel.
8. **Day 14:** We ask our host to cancel the reservation.  The host refuses and says we must cancel because she doesn't want us having our full refund and that we should pay for the time we stayed.  We think that because we were kicked out for violating rules that didn't exist that we deserve a full refund, not to mention the lying, accusations, and threats we received.  They violated the [Terms of Service](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2908/terms-of-service) where it says hosts should ""Act with integrity and treat others with respect"".  Furthermore, on the [Trust & Safety](https://www.airbnb.com/trust/standards) page it says that hosts ""should not fail to disclose hazards and habitability issues"".  In the [Canceling During Your Stay](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/544/canceling-during-your-stay) article it says that ""If your Host cancels your reservation, you will always get a full refund, including all fees and taxes.""  Airbnb told the hosts they can't kick us out for the nonexistent puppy rule, so the hosts instead tell them we violated the rules mentioned in the opening paragraph: that our 6.5lb dog was aggressive toward them and that she kept them up barking at night.  Our puppy did a soft play-growl with their dog, completely non-threatening as she loves all dogs and just wants to play.  Husband Host was there when it happened and even said ""aww she just wants to play.""  Our dog did bark a bit at night as we got her used to crate training, but after a week she was good.  Here's our issue with these alleged ""rule violations"": 1) the aggressiveness thing is a straight up lie / intentional misrepresentation and 2) the hosts NEVER came to us with these issues.  As stated in the [Guest Reliability Standards](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2894/guest-reliability-standards), the host is supposed to communicate issues with the guest to find resolutions.  Not to mention, they only brought this up to Airbnb 6 days after telling us to leave and 1 day after we left for a hotel, and again only after getting caught lying about the ""no puppy"" rule.  We typed this all out to Airbnb (because of course we can't get them on the phone), but nevertheless they ""determined"" we violated the rules and are therefore ineligible for a full refund.
9. **Day 15:** We go back to the residence to grab all of our stuff and move it out.  We spend 9 hours cleaning the place because we are paranoid that they're going to try to charge us for damages.  Admittedly our dog peed on the rugs (not carpets) a bit and those may need professional cleaning even though we did our best.  The host mentioned ""10s of thousands of dollars"" for replacing their floors, although our dog never peed on their floor for whatever reason.  We hand scrubbed the entire floor and treated all the rugs with stain and odor remover.   Obviously we also cleaned up the best we could each time our dog peed, immediately, as we always had our eyes on her.  If we damaged their rugs, we're happy to pay for them.

Now we are at a hotel with all of our stuff, paying 30% higher nightly rate than our Airbnb, with a puppy, both working from home, and desperately trying to find new housing.  Airbnb has not responded to our messages for 48 hours and I think they are willfully ignoring us.  Despite saying they'd help, they haven't helped us with housing at all.  We are trying to decide whether to accept the hosts' proposal to shorten the stay to the time we spent there and pay them for 2+ weeks of rent, and obviously minus the service fee, or whether to go to the Resolution Center and ask for a full refund.  The other option is to pursue a dispute through our Capital One credit card.  I spoke with them today and they said it would be tough to get back the money for the days that we stayed at the home.  At the end of the day we feel like even if we should have been more aware there could have been sensitivity to a puppy vs a dog, that the host 1) should not allow any dogs in a home with such EXPENSIVE FLOORS because even housebroken dogs pee in new environments sometimes, 2) should have written that rule out explicitly, 3) should have checked to see the age / condition of our dog when we mentioned we were bringing one if they're so sensitive about it, 4) SHOULD NOT HAVE LIED TO US about the no puppy rule they made up retroactively, 5) should have made an earnest effort to work something out or accept compensation for damages, 6) should not have willfully misinterpreted our genuine, thoughtful letter, 7) should not have called us deceitful or sneaky when they are the ones who actually got caught lying, and 8 ) should not have threatened legal action.  As awful as they have been to us, we feel like Airbnb dropped the ball even harder because if they responded with a person dedicated to our case who worked with any sort of care that 1) we could have gotten out of there quicker and 2) tensions would not have blown up over the course of the week.  Why did Airbnb tell us they would help us with finding / affording a new place if they never intended to?  If we knew they wouldn't do anything, WE WOULDN'T HAVE WAITED FOR THEM TO HELP US AND WE WOULD HAVE LEFT SOONER!  We felt like their customer service system was designed to not be of assistance for mediation and instead they intentionally ignored us to have us hash it out ourselves, but when your host doesn't believe anything you say and makes threats how are we as guests supposed to deal with that?

If you've made it this far, congratulations.  Open to any and all feedback, critical or supportive of us.  Please provide recommended next steps if possible.

Airbnb,Host requests $ for electricity usage but not listed in price breakdown [Aruba],"I understand this topic is covered a lot on this forum, but I've seen some conflicting info. It seems to me the airbnb rules are that other than for damage, if a host wants to charge the guest for something, it must be included in the listing AND the price breakdown prior to booking. [https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/251](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/251) 

That link says: ""You booked a place, usually a hotel, that charges additional fees collected at check-in or within 48 hours of checkout—these must also be stated in the listing **and your price breakdown prior to booking**.""

So while I have sometimes seen people write that utilities can be charged to the guest as long as they are mentioned in the listing, that doesn't seem exactly right.

KTLA 5 --

An alleged scammer who is accused of using listings on Airbnb and other vacation rental sites to defraud would-be tenants has been indicted on federal charges.

Shray Goel faces charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, according to an indictment filed last month.

Goel, believed to be about 35 years old, and accomplices allegedly used “a variety of fake host accounts on Airbnb and Vrbo” to net about $7 million, according to Court Watch and 404 Media, which reported the indictment on Tuesday.

Between January 2018 and November 2019, Goel and others “would allegedly double book their rental properties, meaning that multiple parties were supposed to stay at them at the same time,” the report said.

“They would then trick customers into taking replacement bookings at inferior residences, and find ways to refuse refunds to guests who were entitled to them, the court record reads,” according to Court Watch and 404 Media. “In some cases, Goel and others listed properties that they were not affiliated with at all, or which did not exist.”

The alleged fraud involved properties in Los Angeles, Malibu and Marina del Rey, according to the indictment, as well as locations across the U.S.

“The scheme involved nearly 100 properties across much of the country, including California, Colorado, Illinois, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, Texas, Tennessee, and Wisconsin,” the report said.

The alleged grift came to prominence in a 2019 Vice report after the author, Allie Conti, was victimized. In that report, a screenshot of Goel’s LinkedIn page showed he was based in Los Angeles.

A Twitter account that appears to belong to Goel was active as of Dec. 29, 2023, but has not responded to a request for comment by 404 Media.",26,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/18x1npn/alleged_airbnb_fraudster_based_in_la_indicted_on/,2024-01-02 21:58:29,Booking.com

First of all, it's extremely cheap at 14 euros per night. This is likely due to that it's just 2 mattresses on the floor and nothing else. They also need at least 99 hours between each booking... why?

Further, it is extremely passive aggressive everywhere you look, in the description, in the images. I'm assuming this person had a different listing/account before, and got bad reviews and decided to remake. Also basically shitting on people that don't speak German or English well.

Then there are the random Chinatown pictures that have nothing to do with the listing. The host said it's because they LOVE Asian culture.

Lastly, there's even an option to stay for free ""if you ask nicely"", or if you do handyman work for them or help in the garden. 😳

Airbnb,"Host didn't cancel rent and beat guest up after partially refunding the rent [Novi sad, Serbia]","Host Zorica attacked My friend(2nd guest). Hitting My friends head by the floor leaving multiple wounds on her face.

STORY

I rented an apartment in Novi Sad, hosted by Zorica, for my friend to stay. Upon arrival, my friend found the apartment dirty, with malfunctioning sinks and showers. She requested a refund and cancellation from Zorica, who insisted we cancel it ourselves and partially refunded the money. Despite this, my friend stayed.

The next day, Zorica arrived with the police to evict my friend. After the police left, Zorica attacked my friend, pulling her hair and slamming her head against the floor, causing multiple injuries.

My friend reported the incident to the police but was ~~detained for a day~~ (EDIT: she wasnt detained - her passport was taken away for 6 hrs) , during which her passport was confiscated. Unable to seek immediate medical attention, she was eventually released. I had to transport her to Belgrade, where she needed two days of rest to recover from the ordeal.

EDIT:   
Me and my friend both were registered as guests on the airbnb trip. My friend arrived first and i was planning to join her on the weekend when i had time. I think it's okay to book apartments like that.   
ALSO: I asked host to cancel myself in airbnb chat as well.

Airbnb,"Arguing with Airbnb Support about ants [CA, US]","Arguing with Airbnb Customer Service about ants

Situation: Recently arrived at a reservation we made, and within half hour of arriving we discovered over 20 ants, including some on and near the bed.  We took many pictures, and shared it with the host and Airbnb support.  Support says we need to wait for the host to respond to see if a refund will be granted.  After waiting over 2 hrs, we gave up and checked into a nearby hotel through booking.com.  Airbnb Support says that our pics do not show that there is an ""infestation"" of ants, so therefore is simply a ""low severity pest issue"", and basically won't give us a refund unless the host responds and agrees.  

What's the best course of action for us?  I've tried to reach out to another airbnb support rep but just got stonewalled because a ticket is already opened.  They are unwilling to clarify on ""infestation"" despite all of the pics we sent.  Is it possible to reach a manager (and how?) or do I just need to dispute the charge on my credit card (Chase Reserve) now?

Airbnb,Got compensation and full refund after e-mailing CEOs about fraud and harassment [Belgium],"In January I wrote here about my experience being racially and sexually harassed by a host in Brussels who then lied to AirBnB to get my booking canceled by saying I trespassed into a room I wasn't supposed to be in. AirBnB suspended my account and canceled my reservation, not caring that I had witnesses for my claims and witnesses that the host made false accusations. I had incurred travel costs of around 700 Euros that I wanted reimbursed from AirBnB. So, many people thought I wouldn't get anywhere with my claims without a lawyer and especially in the subreddit Belgium people where even trying to deconstruct my claims, saying there's nothing I can do about the injustice I faced. Well, here I am after 3 months and I have been not only given a FULL refund for my reservation (including for the nights I have been there), but also a FULL reimbursement for the travel costs to Belgium, back from Belgium and the costs for the originally planed flights back that were non-refundable and had to be canceled. It was frustrating dealing with all the non-helpful copy & paste messages from customer service that mostly clearly didn't even read my messages. After two months of trying to get customer service to answer my questions and grant me compensation, I researched and e-mailed the following addresses. After a week, I got the message that I would be compensated. This comes after numerous messages from customer service that they would not be reimbursing me the travel costs. (Side note: the host's listing was removed, but he simply re-uploaded it. AirBnB said they “already reached a decision in my complaint = removing the initial listing; but they don't seem to care much that he just circumvented their decision and re-uploaded the room...basically sexual predators and fraudsters face zero consequences on their platform).

Airbnb,Sketchy montreal host - What to do when they are claiming you broke something?,"Hello,

&#x200B;

Renovations had to be made in my current apartment so I needed to move out for the month. I found what I thought was a [good deal for the price](https://www.airbnb.ca/rooms/788530928180514282?guests=1&adults=1&s=67&unique_share_id=9490330c-771f-4871-b244-9cdf32b0ac4b), 120$/night with a pool and sauna. This is my first AirBnB experience and #318 - 1000 Rue de la Commune E, Montreal sounds like a great place to spend time away from home.

The place was a little dirty, including a nasty shower that needed to be cleaned. Several small issues showed up along the way - but nothing I could not fix or clean. I needed the place for a month but the insurance would not give me the go-ahead without first confirming with my landlord about the renovation progress. After the second week, somebody else booked and I was forced to find another AirBnB (they left a nasty review).

So far it's not the end of the world. I had my desktop computer with me and moving took up an entire day with Uber rides. I left a couple of chocolates with the keys on the counter and made my way to my next home away from home. The host left me a great review the following day as I did.

A week later, [Alex](https://www.airbnb.ca/users/show/460857316), the AirBnB host, sent me a picture of his TV broken asking what happened. I kindly explained to him the TV was not turning on at all while I was there and that I was using my desktop computer for work and entertainment. I told him about all the other issues I fixed and cleaned also. He immediately sent AirBnB a reimbursement request I declined respectively. There was no way I had broken his TV since it was never functional from the start.  I sent them a very honest explanation of everything I fixed and cleaned, and showed them what pictures I had - including the entertainment setup I had done for myself.

Fast forward to the Airbnb resolution. AirBnB has decided I broke the TV without the host providing any proof. The explanation was that the Host simply has never asked for reimbursement before. I could not believe it so I asked the claim to be escalated to somebody who could read all our messages and see the holes in this guys demand. That was also turned down by Airbnb.

After explaining to several of my friends and showing them the pictures somebody noticed the hole in the shower ceiling. There was Black Mold growing in the bathroom ceiling that was eating away at the drywall. I had not taken lots of pictures but I had one that showed what kind of person I was dealing with - one that was causing myself and all his other guest health issues. A counter ticket was opened with AirBnB about this issue. If AirBnB was going to be completely unjust this would help level the playing field. I asked for a full refund do to the health risks the host has caused (without mention of his griefing).

AirBnB has just gotten back to me about the health issues the host is causing his guests and they have denied the claim under its 72/h Aircover clause.

What do I do next? I feel like I've entered the twilight zone with this issue.

This has been an absolutely terrible first experience. Does anybody have advice?

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**  
Thank you for a lot of the advice. I am currently trying them out.

Airbnb,I have been suddenly banned from Airbnb. While staying at an Airbnb with another reservation having been due in 2 days (both of which have now been cancelled),"So, for context, I have travelled a lot over the past 5 years, with myself staying in Airbnbs pretty extensively during this time. In those 5 years, I have had a squeaky clean history with only 5 star reviews from all the hosts I stayed with, and I have never given any of my hosts less than 5 stars either.

I am currently in the smack dab in the middle of a 5 day stay in Nashville, which is set to be immediately followed up by a 7 day stay in Chicago. Cue my complete and utter disbelief when the remainder of my current Nashville stay as well as my upcoming Chicago stay have been cancelled/refunded, with Airbnb support sending over the following followup email:

> After carefully reviewing the case and information available, we’ve determined that your account should be removed from the Airbnb platform. Removal means that your account will no longer be accessible, and you won’t be able to create another one. 

> In this case, the Safety section of the Community Standards was not complied with, which you agreed to in the Terms of Service. 

> You can review our Community Standards at: 

> airbnb.com/help/article/3328 

> Any upcoming reservations that you booked as a guest have been canceled, and we’ve fully refunded you. 

> You can learn more about what account removal means in our Help Center at: 
> airbnb.com/help/article/432 

> If you have new information you believe would lead us to reconsider, you’ll need to submit a request to our Appeals team. 

> You can do this by going to: 

> airbnb.com 

> Then, enter your email and password, and follow the prompts. A member of that team will aim to contact you within 72 hours of submitting the appeal. 

Just like that. And I checked the app/website as well. It's for real, I have been banned. This isn't some elaborate phishing scam. It's legit.

Again, to reiterate, I have had nothing but 5 star reviews. And this came out of complete nowhere. There was no indication that any sort of complaint was ever filed against me, no indication that my account was ever under any sort of review or suspended pending investigation, no transparency, nothing.

I'm truly at a loss here. The only even remotely controversial thing I've had happen in an Airbnb is when I booked a place in Houston a few months back, and the host made a sudden request for $50 for a ""reservation guarantee payment"" in the weeks leading up to the booking (using the same payment request portal I'd assume hosts would use to charge guests with cleaning fees or those who trashed a place). I saw right through that as being bullshit and disputed it, letting them know the host was violating ToS. Unsurprisingly, that booking was cancelled some 3 days before the trip to Houston, but I had booked another place in advance since I kinda figured that might happen.

This, though? This is a complete out-of-nowhere shocker. And I am typing this from an Airbnb in Nashville that I technically am no longer even staying at.

Obviously, I used the followup prompt I got when logging in to express how appalling the lack of transparency into this was. Which host/stay was this safety violation related to? Which specific safety/community guideline was I alleged to have violated? When was this complaint filed?

But otherwise... man, I don't know what the hell to do, I am at a loss here. I'm also trying to reach out to my host in Nashville directly to see if I can at least continue the remaining 2 nights of my stay as-is, considering this has come as a complete and total shocker. For Chicago, I realize my only option will be to spring for a hotel, but thankfully prices seem to have gone down from where they were before.

But otherwise, I've made my plea to Airbnb. I just don't know what the hell else I can do here or what would've caused this situation to just abruptly occur. As I said, I was never made aware of any safety complaint against me, and my previous hosts have given me 5 star reviews across the board. Like, what the fuck could've happened here? What the fuck would the explanation be for something this abrupt?",31,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/14n4wlq/i_have_been_suddenly_banned_from_airbnb_while/,2023-06-30 16:20:52,Booking.com
Airbnb,is Superhog legit? I've never heard of it and a host is asking for $1k security deposit,"Hi there!

Has anybody been asked to pay a security deposit through Superhog? This is my first time ever hearing of this company and all the Google searches are dodgy at best.

From the AirBnB site:

Security deposits

Hosts aren’t allowed to charge guests a security deposit through our Resolution Center or outside the Airbnb platform. Instead, we inform guests at the time of booking that their payment method may be charged if they cause damage during a stay.

There is one exception: Hosts who manage their listings with API-connected software can set a security deposit using our offline fees feature. If a Host has done this, the deposit requirements will be clearly communicated during the booking process.

Not sure if this falls under the exception? HELP!

&#x200B;

EDIT after hearing back from Airbnb support, looks like it's a legit practice:

&#x200B;

 **Airbnb Support**12:00 PM Hello! This is Josh from Airbnb Support Team!

So I replied with our flight time and asked for a local coffee shop recommendation. 
[Here](https://imgur.com/a/5JRROho) is their reply.

I've only had great experiences with Airbnb thus far, but this is the first international booking I have done and I'm a little paranoid that we are getting scammed. If anyone could offer their advice on this it'd be appreciated. As well as steps to take after this.

**Edit: Thanks for your replies everyone, I’ve decided to definitely cancel the reservation as I’ll still get a full refund. And I’ll report her too, just in case she’s trying to illegally rent it out.",10,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/17s3nht/help_requested_do_you_think_i_am_getting_scammed/,2023-11-10 13:08:14,Booking.com
Airbnb,AirBnB operator asking for security deposit outside of app [USA],"Hello, I just booked an AirBnB and the company that operates the AirBnB sent a link to an e-signature website for the booking and are asking for a $300 deposit with a credit card outside of AirBnB. I’ve never come across this before. My first thought is it could be a scam, but I looked up the company and they seem to be real. Has anyone else come across this? How can I look into this more to feel confident about it before signing and giving security deposit?

Airbnb,We find Airbnb to be a better value than ever...,"I see a lot of complaints on  this thread, but I have to say, as a family of three we have changed to nearly only staying at Airbnbs.  Hotel rates have skyrocked and add parking and resort fees.  Additionally we get a kitchen and separate bedrooms.  If people are angry about excessive cleaning fees, it seems like they are looking at the wrong hosts.  So much hate toward Airbnb, but we have found it to be great.  Of course, good research is required, no different from choosing a good hotel.  Just my opinion.",56,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/12h76bk/we_find_airbnb_to_be_a_better_value_than_ever/,2023-04-10 04:34:31,Booking.com
Airbnb,PSA: Do not sign contracts outside of the platform,"After years of hosting and traveling on Airbnb and more and more management companies using the platform, I am finding this to be more common and ridiculously aggravating.  You are only hurting yourself if you agree to additional terms after booking.  To be clear: if the host did not disclose an additional required contract in full BEFORE you booked, they cannot ask you to sign anything else, electronically or in person as part of the agreement.  3 times in the last year I've dealt with this.

In Orlando: booked a condo and the management company immediately cut and pasted a bunch of terms and conditions into our chat and sent me some electronic forms to sign.  The cut and pasting was the most ridiculous thing.  I responded with ""you understand this isn't legally binding right?"" and refused the electronic forms.  I was clear that they were welcome to cancel my reservation if this was a deal breaker for them, but that our contract was on Airbnb and only Airbnb.  I also told them they needed to update their listing to disclose the contract in advance.  They didn't. My review reflected.  

In Clearwater: booked a condo, got electronic documents.  Refused again.  Same communications.  When their condo didn't meet the terms of the listing they said ""well it was disclosed in the additional contracts,"" that's your problem, not mine.  They also did not revise their listing.  Again reflected in my review.

In Costa Rica: booked a condo.  When I got there to pick up the keys, they present me with a written contract.  Hard no. Language barrier was really fun but their argument was ""you only have contract with Airbnb, this is with us."" I refused again, ""OUR contract is mediated by Airbnb.  We do not need another one and I will not agree to additional terms."" I was given the keys.  Advised them to update their listing.  You guessed it, they did not.  In the review.

These hosts all violated their contract with Airbnb and all said no one else has ever had a problem with it.  Please push back hard on this behavior because these management companies are ruining the platform.  I'm to the point where I just won't book with hosts who have multiple listings.  You will never be served by contracting, communicating or paying outside of Airbnb.  And if anything ever goes wrong and you have, you have no recourse.  Airbnb cannot and will not help you.

Edit to add, for those hosts who clearly haven't read their Terms of Service and believe they're entitled to this gross infraction of them, here's the authority on the matter:  https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/465/can-hosts-ask-guests-to-sign-a-contract",87,98,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/d3o2ya/psa_do_not_sign_contracts_outside_of_the_platform/,2019-09-13 11:50:31,Booking.com
Airbnb,Your reservation has been suspended SCAM [USA] [CR] ,"Looks like the scam is alive and well unfortunately. 

Received this message from host:

*Your reservation has been suspended, please update your details again, all information is here :* [*scamsite.com/gghgd*](http://scamsite.com/gghgd) *All instructions will be provided to you in the support chat. We look forward to seeing you soon, best wishes.*

Once I clicked on the link a more than helpful chatbot informed me:

*Dear traveller, due to changes in the legislation of our region, all guests are required to go through a credit card verification process, even if the booking has been paid in full. Please add your payment details and follow the instructions on the website.*  
  
*Please note that in order to verify the validity of the card, a transaction will be carried out which will result in a temporary booking amount equal to the value of the booking or a random amount. These funds will be promptly refunded by the system to your card within seconds.*

What I noticed the first thing was that they wanted payment in Euros, which is very odd for the destination. Anyways, all my Spidey senses went haywire and I opted to call AirBnB instead. They confirmed that the booking was still valid and that they will escalate. Very shortly after I received a message from the host:

*Dear guest,*  
*Our apologies for this previous message. We believe that Airbnb has been hacked. We are currently working with them to resolve this issue as soon as possible. Your reservation is confirmed and hasn't been cancelled.*

It certainly makes me wonder. The host is a Superhost (probably why they were targeted). Be careful out there folks! Has anyone gone through with a reservation after this happened?

Airbnb,"Negligent Corporate Host Nearly killed my dog then threatened to evict me - Need Advice [Paris, FR]","**Summary:** Duped into renting a ""luxury"" Paris apartment by corporate host, [CheckMyGuest](https://checkmyguest.fr/fr), which used bogus photos of a non-existent amenity. Encountered numerous problems and hazards including no functional toilet, constant flooding, and a poorly-installed washing machine that toppled out of its closet, nearly crushing my dog. The company is now pressuring me to sign a secrecy agreement for a minor rebate after a distressing month-long stay.

**Full Story:**  I rented an expensive Paris apartment from someone I thought was a charming private individual French host named “Joffrey” but he turned out to be the founder of of a shady billion-dollar French scheme called ‘CheckMyGuest’ which I believe hide many of their thousands of listings under this individual persona.  In reality, the apartment was the most unpleasant, unprofessionally-managed and unsafe place I’ve ever stayed in my life.  

After wasting an hour traveling across Paris to pickup the keys, I opened the door of the newly-renovated “luxury” apartment to hear the sound of flowing water.  Turns out, the only toilet was [constantly running and unusable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNPRFUFABYA) (tank was behind wall so I couldn’t try to fix it myself).  Not a good start I tried not to get upset, I figured it was a solvable problem and continued to explore the apartment where I then found the main bathroom which I was shocked to see was completely [different to the photo](https://imgur.com/a/95PMB3a).  **I have a medical condition (L5/S1 Sciatica) which makes using a bathtub easier than showering**, which is why I picked a listing with a tub…but the landlord used misleading photos clearly depicting a bathtub which was not present in the unit. Trying to make the best of the situation and tired after a long day of travel, I used the brand-new shower only to realize it was so poorly constructed that the [whole bathroom pools with water](https://imgur.com/a/AktN9g4) within seconds of running the shower.  I cleaned up the mess, made a quick dinner (kitchen was mostly fine except for a dirty bottle left from a worker and no garbage can) and I went to bed.  

The next morning I decided to head to a nearby gym but first I took some of the sopping wet towels from the flooded shower and tossed them in the new washing machine, turned it on and went out, leaving behind my [10lb toy poodle](https://imgur.com/a/e4NG7bR).  An hour and a half later I came home to [this](https://imgur.com/a/eRRRzyT), the machine evidently wasn’t installed properly and during the washing/drying cycle it toppled out of the cupboard, nearly crushed my dog (**she’s ok!**) and left a huge dent in the floor.  I called Airbnb to express my concerns (listing photos didn’t match the unit, the dangerous appliance, flooding, etc.) and Airbnb said I could move to another unit at no cost (but the Airbnb rep and I couldn’t find any nearby) or, based on their policies (primarily against inaccurate photos), [I would be entitled to a 30% rebate](https://imgur.com/XDcYxzt). 

[CheckMyGuest](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g187147-d15200741-Reviews-Eiffel_Tour-Paris_Ile_de_France.html) is a massive corporation which according to Joffrey’s Linkedin has over a billion dollars in ‘investor funds’ to buy Airbnbs.  They **outsmarted Airbnb’s anti-fraud policy** by telling both Airbnb and me that if I insisted on trying to get the 30% refund that Airbnb decided upon, they would simply end my booking and leave me without a place to stay.  Given their threats and with nowhere else to go, I ended up staying (they offered a 10% refund which barely covered my costs to fix the place), hiring a plumber (CheckMyGuest said they’d send someone but never did) to address the pooling water issue, and bought my own trashcan.  They never bothered explaining to me what caused the appliance to fall so I refrained from using it again and just paid for the laundromat.  On the day I checked out I ran into a neighbor (it appears that CheckMyGuest manages the whole building) who said that the adjacent unit’s **ceiling just collapsed due to flooding**).  

After I left, I sent an Airbnb message to CheckMGuest to express my disappointment about all the above.  The person responsible for all their long-term leases (it was a month stay) called me and has now asked me to come to their office at 5PM today for a non-disclosure agreement in exchange for a 10% rebate.  They’ve also said the matter has ‘gone to their lawyers’ which I think is just a scare tactic as I’ve done nothing wrong.  **Should I go to the meeting at their office?  Has anyone else seen a host cheat airbnb by threatening to evict someone rather than following the rules?**",14,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/17mzl3n/negligent_corporate_host_nearly_killed_my_dog/,2023-11-03 16:55:28,Booking.com
Airbnb,"Staying as the guest of a friend, is it worth it to share my own feedback with the host? [USA] ","To add a preface to this, I will pay the fee that is involved, I am seeking feedback for my own understanding. 

I recently helped plan a trip with a friend who is the one that used his account to book the trip. There were four of us total, and I live about 30 minutes from the listing, however I don’t live in a home that can accommodate four people so we booked an Airbnb. The rental is listed as dog friendly, and I do have a dog. We stayed Thursday night through Sunday morning. On Saturday, my friend who was watching my dog got called into work, and since the listing was dog friendly, I figured it wouldn’t be an issue to have my dog stay with us for the night since the listing was dog friendly. 
—This is where I fully accept responsibility, as the listing does say $100 for a pet fee if you bring a pet. I didn’t know that until after. I will pay, no problem. 
After leaving, my friend shared screenshots of the host saying there is a $150 “unexpected cleaning fee” due to excessive pet hair. [Here is the photo evidence](https://imgur.com/a/S6ZHyLL)

Truthfully, I feel annoyed by that phrasing, (unexpected pet not included on reservation seems more appropriate) which is why I’m seeking external advice. Perhaps it’s just my irritation fueling this, and I need to let it go. 
Prior to Saturday, I suggested my friend provide feedback to the host, as I have always had a great experience with Airbnb super hosts, and truthfully I expected more from our stay. Minus the above issue, here are some things that made my stay (and probably will have others not feeling good) :

-all of the dishes we used (plates, bowls, silverware, pots and pans etc) had residue and build up on them
-the advertised rain shower was leaky and had low pressure, making it difficult to use (wouldn’t be an issue except it is a major highlight the host advertises in the listing) 
-the bed I stayed in was honestly not comfortable, minimal bedding and my friends shared early on in the trip that their bed had a uncomfortable groove in the mattress making it difficult to sleep in
-I’m not sure if general multi surface cleaner is usually included, but I try to be as tidy as possible, and although they did have a bottle available, it was empty.
-there is a large glass front entrance to the home that faces the main road, like a whole 10ft or so of glass, with no curtains. The listing advertises local walking trails, so there were a lot of people walking to and from. I generally like privacy and didn’t like knowing people could see inside the main living room and kitchen. I think the option for privacy would be nice. 

Originally, I had asked my friend to share this feedback as I am someone who values reviews in order to make the stay more enjoyable both for myself if I can improve on something and for the owners of businesses.
However, at this point, I feel as though it sounds like I’m only bitter about the dog thing— which to be fair, I am. But that isn’t the only issue I had with the stay and honestly, I just feel like this was one of those trips where the cost wasn’t worth the money due to the accommodations, cleanliness and level of comfort. 

Is this just one of those things I need to drop and move on? Or is the feedback (not including the dog) actually relevant and worth sharing with the host?

Airbnb,What is this form I’m being asked to sign at my Airbnb in Berlin? [Germany],"I’m staying in an Airbnb in Berlin and the host requested I fill out [this form](https://imgur.com/a/F3yjtxT)

The host said:

“You will find questinary in your apartment, please fill it out complete and sign, we need it for the city tax attestation.

Leave the completed questionary on the table when you leave and i will collect it .

Thank you for cooperation”

I want to be a good guest but also want to know what I’m signing because the language is confusing.

Edit: I should clarify that I specifically feel like this form is asking me to state I’m on a professional business trip, but I’m 100% on a leisure trip. Unless I’m misunderstanding this form, I’m concerned I’d be making incorrect statements. Also, throughout the booking process, I was never asked whether this was a business trip, so I’m taken off guard.

Edit 2: In the end, I messaged the host an hour before checking out. I told him that it seemed he had left the wrong form and I requested a new one (which I said I’d send back electronically). He just said “no problem” and nothing further. So I left without signing the form and he hasn’t contacted me since.

Airbnb,Posted 3 months ago about a host trying to force me to cancel as they set their prices to low. Thought I'd do a quick update on the resolution.,"[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/xo595m/booked_a_place_host_immediately_messages_me/) is the original post.

Here's how it played out: Air BNB didn't respond to my messages on the app, so I had to play kind of dirty and hit them up on their instagram page. They messaged me there, then followed up on the Air BNB site, apologizing and assuring me this wasn't allowed. They were going to be gracious enough to allow me to cancel without a penalty... which wasn't really enough for me or my wife. (Meanwhile, the host messaged several times with multiple ""aw, shucks, but that's the way it is"" type apologies and additional refusals to follow the site's policy.)

There was some back and forth with Air BNB but maybe because I had screenshots of everything, I was given an immediate and full refund of the cost of the booking plus a fifty dollar credit. I used this to book another Air BNB with another host in the same area whose price was close to the original listing's price.

A satisfactory resolution from my end, I think, but my wife and I vowed we're done with Air BNB. Too much of a headache and there were too many decent hotels in the area who didn't come with warnings (""please don't turn the heat below this level or above this level and DO NOT TOUCH this switch!!"") and chore lists and electronic locks that didn't work right (""just try it three or four times, it should let you in!"").",56,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/zxnveq/posted_3_months_ago_about_a_host_trying_to_force/,2022-12-28 22:57:42,Booking.com

Airbnb,Has anyone ever had a request to Airbnb for a refund be successful?,"I booked a nonrefundable property, and the host did not give me accurate checkin instructions (he said he would give a key code and never did). So I waited at the property for him to respond, next to security guards. The security guards approached me as I’m an obvious tourist with my luggage, unable to get in, and pointed to a sign that says “THIS IS FOR RESIDENTS ONLY. SHORT TERM RENTERS WILL BE SUBJECT TO $300/DAY IN FINES AND UP TO ONE YEAR IMPRISONMENT”

I contact my host, who responds, still not giving me check in instructions, and he says “it’s not a problem because there are a lot of guests” implying they won’t notice me, which they already have because I was standing there waiting so long for the host. I ask for a refund and he starts ignoring me. I have still not had any way to get into the property AND the guards are aware of me.

I contacted AirBnB days ago explaining the situation and asking for a refund. They have been zero help, responding to me every 24-48 hours saying “we tried to call you but no answer”  yet I’m abroad and I don’t have calling, then a day later “my shift is about to end. Check these Q&As if you need help.”

I truly cannot believe how horrible their support as been and unwillingness to help. Has anyone had a support request successful? A successful request for refund? What do I need to do in this situation? Go to Twitter, tiktok, Instagram?

Airbnb,Airbnb decides to cancel my account of 7 years for no reason,"I've been an Airbnb customer for about 7 years, booking my first trip in around 2015. I usually do 1 or 2 bookings a year, some for work and some for vacations, and have received all positive feedback from all hosts, no exceptions. 

I have booked one new trip for Sept a few weeks ago, however I received a cancellation email on Monday.    
""We know this is inconvenient, so we’ve issued a full refund of $xxxx.xx. While this refund is immediate on our part, it may take up to 5 business days for the refund to reflect in your account.""

I logged into my account, and was redirected to a ""Account Review"" page, which asks me to put in information to tell them why my account shouldn't be locked. I was all ??? at the point so I just asked why my accounts are locked. 

Then a couple days later, my account was re-instated.  I logged in, reached out to the host. She was nice and asked me to rebook, and will refund me the difference(The price got a bit more expensive compare to when I booked a few weeks ago). 

So yesterday, AirBnb called to apologize, and asked me to confirm my issue is resolved. I said yes, and asked why my account was locked, but received no information other than ""our correspondence team will reach out"". I believe this call was recorded for ""Training and quality purposes"". 

Then..this morning, I received another cancellation email..exact same email!!

""We know this is inconvenient, so we’ve issued a full refund of $xxxx.xx. While this refund is immediate on our part, it may take up to 5 business days for the refund to reflect in your account.""

I logged in again, same text box page for account review, put in another question, basically saying ""Why is my account locked again????""

A few hours later, I've gotten an email from Airbnb: Trust & Safety Notification

""Thanks for reaching out. We regret to inform you that we'll be unable to support your account moving forward, and have exercised our discretion under our Terms of Service to disable your account(s). This decision will affect any duplicated or future accounts.

I got a bit frustrated, and I went to facebook/twitter to reach out. 

This is what the FB rep told me

""We've taken a look at your correspondence with the team and see that a final decision was issued in relation to this query. For all information and details please refer to the communication sent by the Support Ambassador. Rest assured that we would like to seek your understanding that we will politely disengage from further discussion of this case. Thank you.""  


So basically I was told to get lost. 

In case you are wondering, I have no criminal background. I have not received a single negative review, the rudest I've been to Airbnb support was to put ""Why is my account locked ?????"".  I checked my CK report and doesn't seem like any credit anomalies.

Here's the summary of events submitted to Airbnb:  
""Kevin booked our house for himself, no additional guests, mentioning that he wanted to ""relax  for the weekend a quiet getaway"" and that he ""wanted a more comfortable space Other then a hotel"".   
  
Shortly after arriving our security door sensors would not stop going off. I followed to inspect what was going on with our exterior house camera. I could see numerous people entering and exiting the house repetitively. When I asked him about this, he said some friends coming to take him out.  
   
He then went to the security camera and moved it to point away from the front door and the exterior to obscure the on-goings. However, the door sensors continued to alert my phone virtually every few minutes for the next few of hours. Through the audio I could hear excessively loud music and numerous people interacting. I assumed a party of a 8, 12, hell maybe 20 at this point possibly?   
  
At this point I called Airbnb support who asked me to prove to them that he was having a party and that they would call him to check. Airbnb support, after speaking to Kevin, informed me that he said there wasn't a party. I asked them what to do from here. I waited for approximately half an hour for someone from Airbnb support to tell me to call the police.   
  
I did not want to call the police as I was apprehensive that it may be escalating the situation more than it needed to be. I drove to the house myself with my wife and a friend.  
  
When we arrived the street was overflowing with cars, with approximately 10-20 people outside. A large black school-bus type party bus was parked outside the house. Apparently, a local high school's senior prom had ended that night and this was a mixture of ex-graduates and recent graduates of Warren Central.  
  
After numerous people trying to obstruct me from trying to enter or view the property and stating that both no one knew a Kevin... or, even better, that I needed to get out of there because the owner of the house wasn't me, the group dispersed.   
  
How did I almost instantly get 50-70 young ""adults"" to exit the house? I said the police were coming.  
  
At this point, I enter the house after waiting for a clown-car like exodus of people to the most incredible amount of marijuana smoke to the point it obstructed vision. It still after massive cleaning slightly smells of pot but hopefully to the point a guest doesn't notice.  
  
About 7 or 8 men are still in the house telling me they are not leaving, that the house and party is paid for and there is no Kevin.   
  
Kevin then eventually comes downstairs and I tell him all of his guests have to get out and he's broken the contract. Kevin then informs me that he's ""not even going to lie"" and that ""it is what it is"" and he was sorry and would cover the damages of the house.   
  
Some of his friends have also now stood up and stepped towards me demanding ""their money"". I told them Kevin could get his money back from Airbnb, partially to defuse the situation and get these guys to exit.  
  
Somehow in addition to these guys downstairs, another group of about 10 to 12 also then come downstairs out of a small 10x10 room. One of the young men comments on his way out that I'm not going to like what I see up there.  
  
Sometime around now the police actually arrive due to the disturbance and party. I have elderly neighbors on one side with a cardiac condition and on the other a mother with 3 children including an infant. I'm sure they absolutely love me (and Kevin's friends) right now.  
  
At this point we go back and forth on Airbnb messaging regarding the damages. I have not even submitted all of the damages to this -- I didn't realize I wouldn't be able to update.   
  
The fact of the matter is I suspect Kevin won't pay anything and I won't receive anything beyond the security deposit so this is probably a giant waste of my time.  
  
Please read the chat history between us for the absurdity of him accepting blame and ""taking responsibility"" for the various damages -- to later try to back up and pretend like it was some small little gathering. Including when he references taking the down the party from social media as to try to get people to stop showing up to the house well after it ""ended"" and police arrived.  
  
I also have the audio of him talking about the lock breaking, the audio of him talking about trying to fake out the camera, audio clips of the party, small clips when the camera finally sort of slunk down and you could see pieces of the party before someone unplugs it and then after I arrived and plug it back in for the police arriving.  
  
Please let me know what you need or I can provide to recuperate any of these damages.  
  
Let me know if it, or how it is possible for us to recoup beyond the security deposit.""

Airbnb,"Im beggining to understand why people hate Airbnb [AB, CANADA]","I'm in a bit of a  nightmare and could use some advice. I recently booked an Airbnb , but things took a horrifying turn. The place I rented has turned out to be infested with roaches and rats, and it's ruining my entire trip!  I rented the place while I look for a permanent place here in Edmonton.  
The problem is, I've already exhausted my entire accommodation budget on this Airbnb booking, so I can't afford to move to another place. Even worse, I complained to Airbnb, but I haven't received a refund or any assistance so far.  
I'm sure many of you have had your fair share of Airbnb experiences, both good and bad. I'd love to hear your suggestions on how I can go about getting a refund or compensation for this terrible situation.  
Has anyone successfully dealt with a similar issue? Are there any Airbnb policies or steps I can take to ensure I get some of my money back? I'm desperate for help and any advice you can offer.  
I haveA LOT of pictures and videos I have shown the host and airbnb support. I even had to buy my own oven to cook my meals cause what they have here is disgusting. On top of that I had my two bikes stolen from the building AAAAND the place dosent look like the photos on the listing.   
My cat has helped me kill some, and I try to hunt down other ones with my bb gun, but this situation is not good.

Airbnb,An upsetting update to the terrible “it’s not my problem you booked my Airbnb” experience,"Hi OP from https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/128o14r/its_not_my_problem_you_book_my_place_terrible/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1

Thank you everyone for your support and suggestions. I was able to get a partial refund on the stay.

However things have now escalated. 2 weeks after this experience, once my bad review was posted, the Airbnb host is now claiming that almost $7,000 dollars worth of stuff is missing and trying to pin it on me. She is saying that I stole a purse, earrings, a hat, and her vibrator (ewww!!!!). Even worse, she is claiming she knows it’s me because apparently the guest after us found her sex toys out on the table and that means we must have used those as well (double ewww!!).

Honestly I’m pretty upset and horrified of being accused of doing something disgusting like that. We definitely did not steal anything and also definitely did not use or touch any of her sex toys! I treat every hosts space with respect and leave it as clean as I found it. I also treat every Airbnb like they have cameras in every room because I know that’s not uncommon. 

Apparently between the time she came home and when we stayed she had two other guests stay in the place. She also had her neighbor have access to the apartment, and her dog walker, and her cleaners so I don’t think there is anyway she could “prove” we did anything with so many individuals with access to her apartment (and her system for giving people access to her place is a single key stashed under a doormat). She also couldn’t prove we did any of what she is claiming because we definitely didn’t do any of it!

I now received an official reimbursement request and Airbnb is saying I need to send any supporting evidence that I didn’t do what she is claiming. I sent as much information as I could supporting that we did not do it, but how does one prove they didn’t do something? If anyone has any suggestions let me know I have 72 hours to send in “evidence”. 

I’m hoping with my 8 other great guest reviews and the fact that this is coming after a negative review and the fact that multiple people had access to her house before she came home will make it so Airbnb doesn’t make me pay the $7,000 dollars for things we didn’t steal. 

But I’m having a really hard time with this and I know even though I would never do what she is claiming in a million years, I’m still feeling so shook up and a little frightened by this. 

So word of warning, never stay at a place with no prior reviews, and always take pictures before and after you stay somewhere in case the host is terrible and you need evidence to prove your not guilty of whatever they are claiming.",41,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/12xqhzh/an_upsetting_update_to_the_terrible_its_not_my/,2023-04-24 17:46:51,Booking.com
Airbnb,Host is asking for a lot of ID/ information in order to check in,"Apologies if this is not common practice in this sub, but I thought this would be the best place to ask. 

I have booked a couple of airbnbs for an upcoming holiday and after reserving one, I was sent a message from the host account asking for ID and some other info that I am a little skeptical of. 

The message was as follows:

Hi ApeJesus9112001 

The apartment you booked is equipped with a self-check-in system. Our team will provide you instructions on how to use self-check-in a day before your arrival and after we receive details from valid documents of all travelers who are coming with you, including yours. Data we need for a registration are following:  
Legal first and last name,  
Place and date of birth,  
Citizenship,  
Type of the ID, it’s number and place where it was issued.  
You can forward them via the platform or to our email address: [bingbong@dingdong.com](mailto:bingbong@dingdong.com) 

&#x200B;

Considering I already have ID on airbnb verifying my identity, it seems odd that they are asking for this much more just to satisfy a self check in system.

Airbnb,Airbnb charging higher guest fees than it's T&C says it will [Colombia],"I was pricing some accommodations and I came across one that costs 565$ (accom+cleaning fee) and the service fee is 94.93$, which is 16.8%. It looked high versus what I usually know so I went to check the HC to see if they increased it: https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1857 . The information was as I knew it (""Most guest service fees are under 14.2%"") but they added a new commission from April 1st if you pay in a different currency than the listing's (like it's the case in this example).

However, even with this commission that should not be charged yet, the article says
 ""resulting in a guest service fee of up to 16.5% of the booking subtotal."" so the 16.8% from the listing I found is at least 0.3% but likely around 2% higher than what they say they will charge. 

I contacted Airbnb because I thought it's an error and they will fix it. However, the support tries to gaslight me (that despite saying ""up to x%"" that x% can still ""vary"") so I want to escalate further just because I'm pissed. What do you make of this, any suggestions?",7,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1aj83y5/airbnb_charging_higher_guest_fees_than_its_tc/,2024-02-05 04:38:38,Booking.com
Airbnb,Various platforms and different guests and advice / input (North America) [USA],"  
Long time host on many platforms.

Over the years we have encountered many different types of guests. In the past year things have become more .. decisive. Interested to know if other multiple platform hosts notice anything recently.

1) Air BNB guests 
Polite, usually responsible and respectful - as they know and appreciate they are graded or reviewed for their stay. 
Airbnb has extensive coverage and kicks off guests.

2) VRBO 
Slightly higher end, a little bit more demanding, usually great guests, have slightly higher expectations, mostly north America. 
VRBO support is way worse than air BNB.

3) Booking.com
Mostly international. Treat places like hotels. More messy, less communication. Various different people from around the world. I think people that have been kicked off or don't use other platforms go here first.
Mostly good guests, but what support *crickets*

Any other platforms?

We recently booked an Airbnb but the host and property manager has sent out a liability contract to us for the upcoming stau.

* The contract also asks us to buy a Property Damage Waiver (or pay an additonal deposit) for any damage that may happen. This is NOT an insurance. (link below)

Airbnb,Airbnb current ongoing nightmare situation - help please,"I really don't know what to do. I booked a place for 34 days. I fully understood the cancellation policy and was not planning on cancelling.

The host messages me about a late availability yesterday, check in I mean. The reservation is in one hour today. I called him last night and here is what he told me (conflicting information and major red flags):

* currently has a ""freak"" renting his place via airbnb who is due to checkout today. my checkin would be late because he wants to get it cleaned (ok fine not that big of a deal however kinda odd hes telling me this stuff about her)
* proceeds to tell me i have to temporarily stay in his bedroom ""dont worry it's a master, kingsize bed etc"" because he has a ""roommate who actually rents the place youre going to stay in but comes down from so and so state every weekend and wednesday, but don't worry, he's leaving the 1st, so temporarily we gotta put u in my room"". what the fuck? that was a **~~huge red flag.~~** **OH I DIDN'T MENTION THAT'S HIS ROOM. HE LIVES IN THAT ROOM!**
* &#x200B;
* he then proceeds to talk to me like im his buddy and tell me the woman was ""walking around naked last night and fucked me, a total freak"" but is supposed to leave this morning. I said that's sketchy arent you worried about her leaving? he said ""trust me anyone who does that will be making a big mistake especially a woman.""

THE AC TUAL FUCK?

I called airbnb and told them this. Not sure what the woman was on because she continued to tell me as per cancellation policy we must contact host to initisate the cancellation etc etc. I said to her that this literally is a safety concern for me now and totally not what I paid for in the description.

She didn't seem to be listening to my concerns. Said she'd get back to me. This was yesterday.

I have heard nothing.

I contacted them again. At this point if they don't help me I guess I just have to speak with my bank. I mean this is completely disgusting customer service. I literally DO NOT feel safe going here nor was anything this guy told me on the phone in the listing.

Am I crazy?

NO. JUST NO. I PAID 1200 FOR MY OWN ROOM. NOT MUSICAL CHAIRS AND STAYING IN THE ACTUAL ROOM THE HOST USES FOR A FEW DAYS  THEN GOING TO THE ROOM. THATS NOT WHAT I PAID FOR. NOT JUST THAT BUT THE DUDE HAS ISSUES MAN I **DO NOT FEEL SAFE GOING THERE**

Airbnb,"Banned from AirBnB for life, with no explanation. No criminal record or bad reviews.","Hello! I'm here making my first Reddit post out of sheer confusion and frustration. I have been an avid Airbnb customer since the age of 18. I am now 24. I have stayed in numerous parts of the world, with nothing but 5 star reviews. I haven't booked with them in about 2 years. I signed in for the first time in a while, a week ago. I was then directed to an error page, saying that Airbnb will review my account, and the Trust and Safety team will e-mail me soon. The next morning, I was sent the following e-mail:

&#x200B;

I did not reach out whatsoever. I had just attempted to log in to my account, for the first time in two years. I have called their customer service number to no avail. I'm just told ""we see you have an account, but I can't access it, and if Trust and Safety sent that message, we are not able to help you. Their decisions are final."" They apologize, and even admit it makes absolutely no sense. I asked to be transferred to Trust and Safety, but apparently they are only reachable via e-mail. I've sent many messages in response, detailing that I am a tax-paying, law abiding, full time working human with no derogatory marks against my account, and no criminal record. I've practically begged them for help or at least an explanation, saying I'll take whatever security measures necessary to redeem my account. No answer. I messaged them on facebook explaining my issue, and all they've said is: ""Hi \*\*\*\*\*\*, we’re sorry for any inconvenience. For account security purposes, we’ll need to verify your information again. Can you reply here with your email address, phone number, and full name on your profile so we can authenticate your account and follow-up?"" (which I've answered, with my information, twice now) - and - ""We appreciate your continued support with Airbnb, \*\*\*\*\*. Rest assured your case is with our specialised team now, and your Case Manager will do their best to help you. Thank you once again for your patience"" (which I've been told twice now, over the course of 5 days).

&#x200B;

I have a good friend who had a similar issue. Her account was banned without explanation; she has no criminal record, all 5 star reviews, and no derogatory marks. She said that upon trying to log in to her mother's airbnb account on her computer, she got the same error message, and shortly after her mother's account was banned. She made the mistake of trying again with her father's account on her computer, and he was banned for life as well.

&#x200B;

The only possible explanation I've theorized: 3 years ago I was abroad in Australia. I stayed at an airbnb with some friends. While I slept, they drank and broke a vinegar bottle and one wine glass. We settled everything through Airbnb, they paid her $400 AUD, and she told me she would not leave me a negative review as she knew it was not my fault. I have also stayed in multiple Airbnb's since this occasion; so banning me 3 years later after multiple 5 star reviewed stays, and a completely financially settled case that left me with nothing but a good review, makes little to no sense to me.

&#x200B;

My mother is a super host with Airbnb, and is hell bent on trying to solve this as she sees the outright nonsense of the situation as well. Via my research, it seems to be a somewhat common and inexplicable occurrence. At most, I've read that someone who has connections to someone else with a criminal record, has been banned for life. I've also read that this happened to people with multiple accounts. Neither of these situations apply to me whatsoever. What is going on here?! Has anyone else experienced this?

\*\*(If it helps at all, I was the victim of identity theft when I was 16 years old. From what I understand, that has been completely resolved)\*\*

Any help, advice, or similar experiences shared would be so very helpful. I'm at a loss, and pretty bummed that I no longer can use this site to book a spot to stay in when I visit my terminally ill grandmother next month. Thank you guys!

UPDATE:   


I have called customer service so many times now. Same answer each time. When I message them on facebook, they ask for my e-mail, phone number, and name. Over and over again. I finally commented my story on their facebook page, posting it on two of their recently uploaded photos.

Then... THEY BLOCKED ME FROM COMMENTING, CONTACTING THEM, AND DELETED MY COMMENTS (on facebook).

I've made a twitter account.. I don't really know how to use it yet but here is my account page: [https://twitter.com/cheeseandpsych/with\_replies](https://twitter.com/cheeseandpsych/with_replies)

Hopefully that shows up for you guys. Please spread the word and retweet if you're in the mood.

I feel absolutely powerless and overtaken. I don't know what to do, but it seems as I should give up. This is a complete scam, and entirely unjust. Customer service is nonexistent based on how much they've ""helped"" me. Lastly, please take a moment to read through the top voted comments on their posts on facebook. Hundreds of other people have had the same experience I did, and many more have experienced far worse. They reply by asking for people's information, saying they'll get back to them. They never do. If you complain further like I did, you'll get blocked even on their facebook.

Do not trust your time and money with Airbnb...

Airbnb,Crazy dangerous host experience,"Hey all. I had never been through something as horrific as what i experienced a week ago in my last and final airbnb. My boyfriend and I planned to stay in Spain, Castellon de la Plana, to go to a music festival and see our favorite band. We are young and it was just the two of us so we wanted something comfortable but not too expensive. So we booked a room in a couple's house, which was the cheapest but wasn't even that cheap. The day before, I messaged the hosts asking if it was possible to check in an hour earlier, they said yes. Then the next day had a change of plans and booked a different train so we arrived much earlier. I messaged her if could just leave our bags in the airbnb and the return when it was check in time. At that moment she was sending very badly written texts but i understood she said yes. We arrived and she welcomed us, I immediately asked were we could leave our bags meanwhile, and she said she actually hurried and had our room ready so she showed us the room and  then gave us clean towels. We thanked her, then i had a shower since we came from a long trip. Then my bf had a shower and we went out to have lunch. When we arrived, each of us had another shower because  there was a heat wave  in spain (literally), so we wanted to cool off.  Then we went back in the room and started getting ready for the concert. Just about when were going to head out, one of the girls knocked on our door. We opened and she was with a terrible face and told us we had to leave immediately, she said we were breaking the rules and behaving inappropriately. We were so confused because we had only spent 3 hours there, and mostly we were out or in our room. She started shouting that she had to clean the bathroom after us like 6 times, and also the kitchen. (we had not used the kitchen) My boyfriend just had a shower so the bathroom had a few drops on the floor and that's what she was claiming was so terrible. We told her we could clean it up, but she kept shouting and kicking us out. I started freaking out because we had nowhere to go, did not know anything or anyone in that city and the host was really starting to scare me. Thank god my boyfriend kept his calm and asked her if we could just have a moment to pack and then we would leave. He also offered to clean anyways and even apologised. However we started packing but the host was harassing us to pack faster and leave, she seemed in a huge hurry. Her girlfriend then appeared and told us she had reported us to airbnb and cancelled our reservation. The two of them started shouting at us for packing ""too slow"" as if we wanted to be there. Then they started threatening to call the police on us. I  was so scared because they were getting more aggressive and intense, I was crying and I just wanted to leave. I told them what was happening was totally uncalled for and then she shouted and complained about how i had texted her way too much and was annoying her before we even arrived with questions on how to get to the airbnb. Then shouted she was also angry because we entered the room and had a shower before check in even though she was the one who led us there and gave us towels. She was extremely rude and pushy and still threatening us, we packed however we could and left trying to keep calm fearing for our safety. Idk what would have happened if we stayed longer or if we had argued. 
We were on the street at 6pm, missed our concert and airbnb was just responding it was our fault because we broke their rules. We had to get an emergency hotel which was almost triple of what we had payed for the airbnb. I was so upset i had a panic attack but luckily we arrived to safety to a good hotel. I called airbnb and told them about the situation, luckily they gave me a full refund. However, the host sent me like 3 request for all of the money i had been refunded claiming they had to clean the kitchen again which we never used and that we peed on the bathroom floor!??? whaaat all crazy lies. Then they sent a huge paragraph accusing us and super angry because we called airbnb. We didn't answer. Honestly, they seemed crazy and dangerous but the whole situation was weird and out of nowhere. We think maybe they were being offered more money by someone else to stay there or they had an issue between them idk. It was bizarre 
I write this post because the host was not held accountable and because they cancelled, I can't write them a review to warn other people. Also, he guy from airbnb told us we had a tough case against them because they are superhosts and it was our word against theirs. However, i checked and they only have 6 reviews and one of them involves roaches. I wonder how many reviews you actually need to be a superhost. So i wonder if there is anyway to get them reported or banned. Here is the listing if anyone knows what to do.  https://www.airbnb.com.co/rooms/49587040?source_impression_id=p3_1658155836_NTIeGt5l6FEnv7Kt
Lastly, what i learned from this situation: record everything!! how you found the place and how you are being treated if they are being aggressive. And honestly that airbnb is simply just unsafe, if as a guest one can be kicked out like that at any time with no safety measurements you are being put at risk especially if you are a woman travelling alone.

Nearly all of these reviews are positive.

Immediately after booking, I get an automated message from the host that I need to click on a link to fill out forms via their verification portal. It asks for my full name, email, and phone number, and the name/email of my wife and son as well. It also asks for a copy of my ID and for my credit card info. 

My understanding (host for several years, guest at >50 properties for 7 years) is that part of the benefit of Airbnb is that they handle all issues related to payment and verification, and that dealing with payments outside of their system explicitly violates their TOS.

What would you do? My gut says this is just a big company applying their brick and mortar process to Airbnb, and is doing so in good faith, even if it technically violates the TOS.",29,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/tjnjad/host_wants_3rd_party_verification_id_credit_card/,2022-03-21 22:14:26,Booking.com

I have a small building with 3 cozy apartments that i currently rent out through booking.com and our website. I’m considering expanding to Airbnb but I have fear for overbooking. I think I need a channel manager. What do you suggest me? (probably I need also a booking engine for my website).

Airbnb,Reimbursment claim from host was decided against me. Any advice how to still fight it?,"Hey, I was very suprised to hear from Airbnb that the hosts reimbursment claim was decided against me.
Refer to my older thread here:

Airbnb wants me to pay 153€ in damages for the rekey (no invoice for the locksmith was provided in the resolution center and I used the key in a normal manner for which I have a witness) for an apartment I couldn't check in after the key broke while I tried to check-in. Normal use of the key does not seem to be my fault. 

Any way to fight it in this stage? They want me to pay within 24h. What happens if I don't pay?

Airbnb,How I think airbnb is hurting both guests and hosts with the covid-19 response,"**Disclaimer**: I am just a software engineer, a human being, someone very frustrated about your service and I know nothing about your business, but this is an open letter to AirBnB and I hope this help.

If you search twitter you will see both hosts and guests complaining about you, everyone is frustrated and this is getting worse.

**Hosts**

The current policy allows guests to cancel reservations from March-14 to April-14.

Some hosts are furious about this, and while I understand they will lose money, **every business has its risks** and they should not charge for a service that they can’t provide, period. 

If this is still not clear, let me draw an analogy **imagine for a second that your house is suddenly under 10ft of water because of a flood, do you think is okay to charge your guests?** This is what is happening, guests can’t travel, all flights are cancelled, in most cases they can’t leave their own houses. 

Where I think Airbnb is failing, is on communicating this properly.

The other way airbnb hurts hosts is not allowing guests to cancel reservations that they know will not be able to use, ie beyond April 14. I think this is important for hosts because it allows to plan ahead of time what to do with those empty dates, either to rebook with other guests or plan with time what to do with the losses.

The global pandemic is not ending on April-14, there is not any solid evidence of this from any serious organisation, nor the quarantine is ending in most countries. It is naive to think that all problems will be solved in this date. The longer you take to act, the more you hurt your hosts. 

As it is right now, you force guests to keep their bookings open. Then it will come to a surprise to hosts that the reservation was cancelled.

**Guests**

If the reservation was for after April-14, guests depends on the good will of hosts and according to a simple twitter search of the tag #airbnbrefundnow [https://twitter.com/search?q=airbnbrefundnow](https://twitter.com/search?q=airbnbrefundnow) you will find that not all hosts are acting properly. 

 I think guests face the following dilema 

* cancel on good faith and ask the hosts to refund the money. While I think this is the right thing to do, to give hosts enough time, as I mention before some hosts are just not returning the money. **This is the common sense, you know you wont make it you let the host know.** 
* option 2: wait until airbnb extend the date, definitely hurting hosts.

If the guest choose option 1, airbnb leaves them abandoned. They depend only in the good faith of the host to get a refund. 

It is also important to note that as a guest, you can't wait until the last minute to know if travel or not. Things need to be arranged and planned and it takes time. 

Even if the host decides to refund everything, airbnb is not doing a refund of their fee.

**Airbnb reputation**

It doesn't matter if a number of hosts are willing to refund, the ones that don't are damaging the reputation of the entire system. Imagine being robbed by $5,000 or $10,000 would you ever use this service again?

I think you also need to level up your support center, I've been waiting a response for 10 days without knowing what to do, at the very least acknowledge that your support center is not working properly and be more sympathetic with both hosts and guests. The first thing I got from support after 10 days is that I should have waited more before cancelling (?)

We are common people using the system, we are not lawyers, maybe we don't understand your policy which has been changing a lot in the last week and maybe we don't know the exact text you are looking for in the different decrees of our countries.

I think you have the power to fix this situation and I understand this is a crisis.

**Edit March 31**

A miracle happened, Airbnb has finally decided that the pandemia is not going to end on April 14 as they originally predicted. So, they have decided to extend the policy until May 31 now. 

They are however, not refunding guests that acted on good faith and cancelled the moment they knew they wont be able to travel because of government recommendations or flight cancellations.",80,78,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/fp2b49/how_i_think_airbnb_is_hurting_both_guests_and/,2020-03-26 01:07:14,Booking.com

Airbnb,Host cancelled last minute and out of pocket - I have used Airbnb 57 times as a guest and was a Superhost for a number of years. [FRA],"This is my first post on this Reddit.  I had an unpleasant experience with Airbnb, and just wanted to see if it was normal and if I could have done something better to mitigate it.

I am staying in Paris for 5 nights, including New Years Eve, as part of my Christmas holidays.

&#x200B;

1. I made my reservation more than 5 months in advance on August 23, 2023.  
2. I was told by my host at 4:04PM on the day of checking in that the booking had to be cancelled. I was already on a taxi with all my luggage going towards the hotel, and I had to book something quickly.  
3. I was forced to make a last minute reservation on New Years Eve, while on a taxi with my family who were panicking, and this meant I had to quickly choose what was available. I already chose the most economical of the available options. 

&#x200B;

Airbnb tells me that the host sent ""documentation"" that the apartment had a water leak, which presumably the host discovered when inspecting the apartment while waiting to greet me for check in.  I scrambled for a hotel, and was lucky to find one.  It was 55% over the price of the Airbnb, as it was last minute and I was on a taxi so I didn't have much time to use comparison websites or look for a cheap option.

&#x200B;

Airbnb will refund me amount of the original booking.  They were willing to give 20% extra on top of that, but I needed 50% to come close to being made whole.  I also checked my travel insurance and it doesn't appear that my host cancelling and me paying extra for an alternative hotel is something I could make a claim for.

&#x200B;

I pleaded with Airbnb support, giving my reasons and asking to have the case reviewed by a manager, but after 2 messages of saying ""we're so sorry"", they simply processed the resolution payout (20% of the original booking's price), and closed my ticket, ""with a note that in case you have any query or concern we have got your back. We are always available for you 24/7, just a call and message away at [airbnb.com/contact](https://airbnb.com/contact).  You are a part of Airbnb family and this relationship is very important for us.""

&#x200B;

I had one previous experience like this (out of 57), and found a hotel that time for a similar cost.  I decided that I will never use Airbnb again (I suppose if there were absolutely no alternatives in an area I was going then I would have to consider it), as I have learned that Airbnb just hangs you out to dry if something goes wrong, including a host cancelling me AFTER the scheduled check out time, which is a shame as it's been a part of my life for 10 years.  I believe it's not even a risk that I can even insure for, though I would be pleased to learn otherwise.

Airbnb,"[Renter Help] Is this a scam? Host asking for payment information outside the platform used to make the booking. [AZ, USA]","Hi folks, looking for a second pair of eyes on this conversation I'm having with a STR host currently. It's through Booking.com, not Airbnb (although the host says he also rents through Airbnb), but figured I'd start my investigation here as I take it there's quite a bit of crossover between platforms.  
Basically, I booked a stay on Booking.com last month that required no upfront payment (although I was asked to put a credit card into Booking.com's platform anyway). Shortly after, I had the host emailing me to ""update my payment information"" via a third-party website so that he could process my payment. Nowhere in the listing was this secondary payment system described or alluded to. After googling the links in his email, I found that the forms are hosted on the OwnerRez/Owner Reservations platform, which I understand to be a legit STR management platform.

I guess I'm a bit confused by the whole experience. From the host's most recent emails, I believe I'm his first booking on Booking.com, which may be contributing to the misunderstandings. But I want to protect myself as much as possible and avoid getting scammed. Is there any way to check the legitimacy of the host's links/OwnerRez forms? Would I have recourse through OwnerRez if this host is indeed trying to scam me? I really like the property, but not enough to risk having the rug pulled out from under me!

Screenshots of his recent email here, with sensitive info blurred: [https://i.imgur.com/qDSLsHe.png](https://i.imgur.com/qDSLsHe.png)

When clicked, the links to his payment form and rental agreement are hosted at the following domain: [https://secure.ownerreservations.com/forms/bookings/](https://secure.ownerreservations.com/forms/bookings/)\[unique ID here\]

Airbnb,Smartlock inside the door integration and wire [EU],"Hey guys, 

I'm currently building a house and the plan is AirBNB with 5 bedrooms. I'm searching for a smart lock to integrate inside the door. 

Think about hotel door locks. There is nothing over it or additionally installed the lock is integrated inside the door. For example, you install Nuki on top of your existing locks i DON'T want that because i'm currently building it and i can go directly inside the door and it's much more visibly beautiful.

The house will have a fully functional KNX system , so any recommendations for electrical mortise lock  its welcomed then i will see how to integrate it with Guesty they have API and i have the knowledge to do it. 

Here is how it must work:

1. **Guest Books Stay**: A guest books a room from Friday to Sunday.
2. **Code Generation**: Guesty generates a code valid from Friday at 12:00 to Sunday at 15:00.
3. **Notification**: The guest receives the code via email or SMS along with their booking details.
4. **Access Management**: The guest uses the code to access the property during the specified period. The code expires automatically at the check-out time.

**Requirements:** 

* Wired
   * I don't want to deal with batteries. Battery backup is fine but not required ( I will have UPS for the doors )
* Integration with guesty / aribnb
   * for automated code generation
* Keypad
   * physically customers to enter the key if they don't want to use a phone app
* Support multiple code generations.

Airbnb,Accommodation entrance and lockbox left unsecured [UK],"So today I made a last minute reservation on booking.com for a self-service guest-house style accommodation with multiple, individually locked rooms in Scotland. There were a few hours between when I booked and my arrival time, but I never received any check-in instructions. Check-in was anytime after 4pm and I showed up around 5:30pm to the front door of the guest-house completely open. I walked in and could immediately see a lock-box containing the cleaners’ set of keys wide open. I called out to see if anyone was there and the whole accommodation was empty.

When I reached out to customer service, the agent was clearly shocked and asked that close the lockbox and shuffle the numbers. But as a solo female traveller, I felt so unsafe at this point given that both the door to the property and the lockbox were unsecured for who knows how long. I brought this up to the agent who tried to assure me that the cleaner had only just left and forgotten to lockup. I figure that it was left unsecured for at least 1.5/2 hours though given the check-in times. I asked for a refund but this was brushed off. I was luckily able to stay with family in the area, but what are my chances of getting a refund from booking.com? The agents making me feel like I’m blowing this out of proportion but I truly felt so unsafe.

At first, customer support said maybe it was locked due to inactivity for so long. They said they’d get back to me within 24 hours.

Airbnb,Airbnb burglarized multiple times in Paris [France],"Don’t bring anything too expensive with you to Paris. If you carry it on you, you’re at risk of pickpockets, but if you leave at your airbnb, you’re still at risk of getting burglarized.

In our case the burglar used a long pole to unlock the door through a window with grates. We later found out the apartment had been burglarized ~10 times (!!!) just in the past year due to poor maintenance as there is a broken window and broken shutters that enable the burglar to easily enter the ground floor apartment. The host basically gave the keys to the burglar, at best through negligence, at worst because they are colluding with the burglar (the burglar also knew the code to the building).

We filed a police report. We also submitted a complaint to Airbnb and are waiting to hear back to see if they’ll at least refund the booking (which won’t come close to covering the losses).

I’m astonished the owner hasn’t fixed the window lock or the metal window shutter (it’s partially down and the remote is missing) after being burglarized every other week. I’m also amazed he didn’t change the locking mechanism - the door auto-locks when closed but easily opens from the inside (like any lock).

If any Airbnb employees lurk here and can help, please message me. In addition to the mentioned issues, the owner lied on Airbnb messages and I have photos and videos with proof. The apartment also violates numerous  Airbnb safety standards mandated by France, such as missing smoke detectors. 

Photos and videos of the burglary are below. Over $8k worth of money and goods stolen!!

Airbnb,Host cancelled 5 days before my trip [USA],"There was nothing the host could do so customer service wanted me to spend more money to book another place. I said I needed the money I had already paid for the former place ($721.15) to go toward a new place. After some back and forth about how my money wouldn’t be available for 15 days and some BS about giving me a $25 coupon, the guy finally gave me a coupon code for the amount of a new booking ($758). The weird thing is, now I have a refund for the old place in my bank account but my new place is reserved. My question is, are coupons gifts from the company? I don’t believe any business would just gift you $758.00 for free. Should I fully expect Airbnb to just yoink this out of my account unexpectedly? 

Here’s the last message:

“Once we confirm the amount of the new reservation your coupon will be increased, I asked you about how much you were able to cover just to have it in written. 

With that been said, I went go ahead and issue a coupon to cover the full amount of your new reservation as one time courtesy from my end. 

Your coupon code is: xxxxxxxx

This $758 coupon will expire in one year, 3/1/2025 and is good for a single use on a Homes reservation on Airbnb. It can't be combined with any other offers or used for previous or existing reservations.

You can also find the coupon code by going to Account Settings > Payment Methods > Your Coupons.

Airbnb,Outside fees not disclosed in price breakdown [USA],"I stayed at a hotel and they demanded a $25 ""destination fee"" as well as a $125 incidental deposit during check-in. My understanding is that both of these transactions are permissible if they are disclosed in the listing AND the price breakdown. [Source](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2827). They were in the listing, but not the breakdown.   


I have chatted and spoken with several Airbnb support people and all of them have given me very confusing replies and they don't think there is a problem.   


For example:  
*""The article which you have shared with me, It's for collecting fees outside Airbnb so all this fees will never disclose in your price break down because all these fees are totally depends on Host, and it may collect by third party application which means outside Airbnb which is not visible in your price break down.""*   


This contradicts with their [own policy](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2827). I don't seem to be getting through to them and I was wondering if you guys have any advice on **how to escalate this** to someone at Airbnb that can understand and take action.   


RANT: I depend on the price breakdown for pricing transparency which also affects searching for listings by price. I understand that info buried in the listing details, but I didn't read the entire listing. I was in a last-minute rush and willing to take a risk on the listing details because I have an expectation for the range of potential things that would be in the listing details and money is not and should not be one of them. This hotel is posting rates that are artificially depressed. One of the main reasons I use AirBnB is because of the pricing transparency and handling of fees within the platform. An example of what I'm avoiding: Expedia listing rooms for $100 and when you get to pay it's all of a sudden $350 with various fees. At least Expedia shows the fees in the final total. With AirBnB I expect to be able to **search and book with total fees calculated before taxes**.  This is what my experience has been in over 35 bookings in the past 5 years. Not this one.

Airbnb,"""Airbnb boss lays foundation for longer-term rentals Booking platform to launch ‘biggest update’ next month as it plans to expand beyond travel"" [WORLD]","Long-term rentals on Airbnb, Airbnb dining pop-up stores, and Airbnb car rentals coming soon! Enjoy.

Airbnb is plotting a push into longer-term housing rentals and a renewed drive on experiences as part of a shake-up of the travel accommodation app.

Chief executive Brian Chesky told the Financial Times that from next year the online rental company would “go a little bit beyond its core business”, including an expansion of its experiences and services. He pointed to more changes, due next month, that would mark the “biggest update to Airbnb ever”.

“Travel is our sweet spot,” he said. “Eventually the big frontier for Airbnb is to go beyond travel,” adding that “there’s an eventual opportunity for Airbnb to become a greater part of your daily life. Not just once or twice a year.”

Offering rentals of up to a year represented a “huge opportunity”, Chesky said. He vowed that, with only 18 per cent of gross nights booked in the second quarter this year coming from stays longer than 30 days, more can be done. Extended stays of more than three months are even rarer.

“In this post-pandemic world, there’s this . . . unrecognised market of a month, two months, three months, because people can work from laptops, people are going away for the summer,” Chesky said.

His vision for a renewal of Airbnb’s business model comes as the technology app faces pressure from policymakers worldwide over depleting housing stock in major cities. New York, which was one of Airbnb’s biggest markets globally, this month introduced rules limiting residents’ freedom to rent rooms in their homes on Airbnb, culling about three-quarters of listings in the city.

Chesky does not see New York as a “precedent”, though. “Most people in New York City and beyond feel like there was absolutely a win-win on the table,” he said, citing offers to city authorities to introduce a hotel tax or a housing registration scheme to limit people renting their primary homes.

Airbnb’s plans include expansion of its housing offering as well as “things to do on your trip”. Chesky also highlighted a “long list of ideas” under consideration, including rental cars and dining pop-ups.

“The second biggest asset usually in someone’s life after their home is their car,” he said. “There’s a variety of ways you could do something with cars.”

He said Airbnb has long considered plans for a pivot into car rentals: “Years ago, we thought like we did homes, let’s do cars, that’ll be the next thing and it’s never kind of come top of the list but it’s super interesting.”

Airbnb this year launched its “rooms” feature, a return to its roots when it would offer space in people’s homes, as well as greater insight into hosts, as part of more than 50 new features and upgrades to the app.

Also speaking to the FT, Jay Carney, Airbnb’s global head of policy and communications who joined last year from Amazon, predicted that New York’s policy will not solve the housing crisis, and will only serve to increase hotel room rates and price less wealthy tourists out of visiting the city.

“New York is a good example of where . . . they have a problem which they think they can fix with this regulation,” said Carney, a former Obama administration official, but he argued that the “sledgehammer approach” will bring “zero change” to the housing crisis.

“It will be compounded by hotel prices [going up while] tourists on a budget won’t be able to come to New York,” Carney added.",13,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/171l11g/airbnb_boss_lays_foundation_for_longerterm/,2023-10-06 19:14:32,Booking.com
Airbnb,Hotel room listing - is this safe? [USA],"Hello, I’ve never used AirbnB before but I’m visiting the USA next year and in some cities the prices of hotels are just out of this world compared to what I’m used to paying elsewhere in the world.  

In one city I have come across a number of listings by a woman that offer a room in a hotel, they all have the same pics and descriptions but are on the map in different locations. It doesn’t say the name of the hotel but I’ve worked it out from the description. 

The strange thing is that the rooms are significantly cheaper (~25%) than the hotel website or any other third party websites like Hotels.com. 

Why do Hotels do this and is it likely to be a safe booking?",5,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/18v6amn/hotel_room_listing_is_this_safe_usa/,2023-12-31 11:54:57,Booking.com
Airbnb,Host canceled on me because of my disability?,"I've been using Airbnb for more than two years now and haven't had an issue like this before. I use forearm crutches, but nothing about my disability would require any accommodations or extra consideration from a host (I myself live in a place with a flight of stairs, my workplace has a flight of steep stairs, I hiked a 165-mile trail last summer, I sport climb, etc....).

&#x200B;

The only thing that would indicate that I have a disability is my grainy Airbnb profile picture. \[Description: I'm standing on a beach boardwalk, and I am using a forearm crutch on each arm. \]

&#x200B;

Anyways, I sent in a booking request which got accepted by the host. I didn't check my Airbnb account for a few days, in the span of which the host took it upon himself to cancel the reservation (with no illusions that it was anything EXCEPT due to seeing my profile picture - nowhere else did I mention my disability), and then send me a...weird message about it post-cancellation. See the weirdness here (the thread actually starts at the bottom of the second picture and moves upwards): [https://imgur.com/a/sGwnBFq](https://imgur.com/a/sGwnBFq)

&#x200B;

According to Airbnb's Anti-Discrimination policy this shouldn't have happened - he made an assumption about my ability and then decided for himself whether or not I could stay at his place based on his assumption.

&#x200B;

I reported the weird message and talked to someone at Airbnb on the phone about it. Airbnb seems fairly apathetic - they sent me a $25 voucher. The issue is, everything left for those dates is out of my price range now. Is there anything I can do, or is this just the name of the game?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I should have mentioned that although my push notifications were turned on (and I've confirmed this), I hadn't been receiving them. When I checked my Airbnb account itself out of curiosity two days after confirming the booking, I found that it was cancelled. I didn't specifically choose not to answer his question about whether the stairs would be an issue.

Airbnb,Trying to identify if listing is a scam [France],"Edit: reported and letting AirBnB handle it, whether a scam or not. The extra money is worth the peace of mind of staying in a well-reviewed place.

Planning a short trip to Paris and looking through listings. Found one that seemed decent for a few nights, but the profile has several listings using the same pictures.

New host, no reviews, but the place seems to be booked before the dates that I would book it for. And I reverse searched the images and confirmed the outside of the windows to correspond with the google maps location of the place. 

I don't book AirBnB often, and when I do, I only go for well reviewed places. Choosing this is going in slightly blindly, so I thought I would get a second opinion from strangers online.

Airbnb,AirBnB host asking for criminal background check and security deposit,"UPDATE: RESOLVED

Airbnb customer service got back. It's legit, but they would need to made it clear up front before booking. And yeah, I'm keeping all communication on Airbnb.

# If a Host asks you to sign a contract

Some Hosts ask guests to sign contracts or rental agreements. This is so the Host can legally enforce certain rules protecting themselves and their property.

You should be made aware of this requirement before you book. The Host must prominently disclose the actual terms in their listing description. If you have questions about the contract, you can discuss it with the Host. You’re not obliged to sign anything.

If a Host tells you about an additional contract after you’ve made a booking request, you should review the contract within 48 hours of receipt of the full terms. If you are not comfortable with it, you can decline to sign it and ask your Host to cancel your reservation without a cancellation penalty.

\- [https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/465](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/465)

&#x200B;

## What a Host may ask for 

The Host may ask for:

* ID upon check-in, if done in person and if the requirement is in the Host’s house rules at the time of booking

**Note:** Some regions have laws that require guests to register with local authorities. This can be done directly with the local authorities or at the accommodation on behalf of the authorities.

Where there is a law that requires guests to register with local authorities, the registration request may come from a bed and breakfast, hostel or hotel room, apartment listings or other accommodation listed legitimately on Airbnb.

\- [https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1237](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1237)

\--------------------

ORIGINAL POST: After I booked, I received a message from the host about house rules I need to agree to (sure thing), but also a security deposit and that I complete a criminal background check form.

&#x200B;

None of this was in the listing anywhere.

Regarding the deposit, I expressed my concern, and they waived it since it wasn't in the listing.

&#x200B;

Regarding the criminal background check, I asked what information they're requesting, which they answered: name, DOB, email, drivers license number and cell phone number. That should be fine right?

And the form they sent is a ""Resident Application for Occupancy"". It's a crappy xerox of the form, and I bet the apartment complex is requiring this? I'm staying 8 nights. The form they sent does ask for SS #, but they highlighted the fields they talked about.

But they want to email me a form for me to email back. I don't want to take communication outside of Airbnb. What should I do?

I contacted customer service, but the English comprehension was low, and he just kept insisting that she only wanted me to validate my ID on Airbnb. I told him that she did ask to validate ID through ABB, but also asked to send a ""criminal background check form"". After that, he forwarded my message to a different team, but my trip is soon and who knows when I'll hear back. I've tried looking all over ABB for information on background checks, but I could only find information on how Airbnb does it, nothing about hosts. I'd cancel with all this mess, but I'd only get a 50% refund at this stage.

Airbnb,AirBnB refuses to reimburse me over 1000$ for emergency hotel [Tunisia],"I had an unfortunate stay at a former AirBnB rental where I got harassed and blackmailed by a security guard. The full story is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1aljr1b/harassed\_by\_security\_guards\_at\_residence\_tunisia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1aljr1b/harassed_by_security_guards_at_residence_tunisia/)

After the AirBnB support agent called me to let me know how we would proceed, he deemed my situation a safety emergency.   
What I was told to do was to leave as soon as possible, and book a hotel for a couple of days.  
Specifically he said that AirBnB would cover this stay while looking for another place, up to around 320$ a night.

When I contacted AirBnB about the invoice and how to be reimbursed, I've been switched around between several support agents - each saying they couldn't find a record of my call (even though I showed them in my call history, and evidence from the chat log that the support agent called me). 

After recognizing that he called me, they keep insisting that they found no evidence that the support agent promised me this much in reimbursement.   
So right now they proposed to refund me 20% of 1 night's stay, which is around 50$.   
But I have paid over 1000$ for this, as I got the go-ahead from the support agent to do it.  


I don't know what to do as this is a big amount of money for me, and AirBnB hasn't been willing to cooperate. Does anyone have any idea what I could do?",2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1b1lsqr/airbnb_refuses_to_reimburse_me_over_1000_for/,2024-02-27 20:17:23,Booking.com
Airbnb,Never using this platform ever,"My friends and I booked an apt for the labor day weekend, and Friday morning, I got a call from an Airbnb case manager Angelo saying that the host needed to cancel my trip because of her “medical emergency”. I told Angelo that since the entire check in process can be done without her presence, and he was ok with it and told me to proceed with the trip. 

We got there, there’s already a group of four girls staying in the apt. Turned out that the host had double booked on both Airbnb and Booking.com, and instead of trying to solve it, she lied about having a medical emergency. I called the Airbnb customers services, was directed to case manager Vernetta. 

Keep in mind, it was midnight in nyc, and I was running a fever of 102 the entire day. All we wanted was a place to rest. The other group called Booking.com customers service, and were offered a FULLY PAID rebooking at any hotel in nyc that’s available. 

And shockingly, my group was offered only an extra 10% of our original payment only if we were to rebook with another Airbnb host. We suggested that we’d like a hotel room of similar price, paid by Airbnb, and was rejected. 

I can not express how disappointed I am right now. I don’t know how many times I have used this wonderful platform. Every time I travel, first thing comes to mind is:”let’s get an Airbnb.” Never will I ever use this platform again, and to whoever can see this thread: the quality of customer service is so important when it comes to a situation like this. You can tell that Booking.com values that customers way more than Airbnb did. 

Thanks for listening to my ranting. I’m supposed to go to a festival in nyc, but caught the bad cold, and now this happened. Hopefully my luck will turn around:) 

Edit: sorry I didn’t explain this clearly: the first case manager, Angelo, told me to proceed with the listing. Because we both thought that since the check-in process can be done without her presence.

Airbnb,Most common reasons guests leave bad reviews,"Hi everyone, 

I want to share with you the latest in my on-going project exploring Airbnb data. [For this piece I took a deep dive on reviews](https://bnbfacts.com/17-reasons-for-bad-reviews-on-airbnb/) using sentiment analysis and natural language processing (NLP) to identify the reasons hosts get bad reviews. These were the top reasons I found: 

1. Broken items
2. Unsafe neighborhood
3. Inaccurate amenities (amenities listed were missing or not as described)
4. Dirty
5. Bathroom (including missing or inadequate towels and/or toilet paper)
6. Uncomfortable furniture
7. Loud noises (from parties or neighbors)
8. Front door (including issues with key/lock or gaining access)
9. Check in (including issues or miscommunications at check in)
10. Host interaction (guest contacted host during stay)
11. Bed (including mattress, pillows, or blanket)
12. Smell (for example mold or garbage)
13. Late to respond (host was late to respond to guest)
14. Room temperature (too hot or too cold)
15. Shower (water pressure, temperature or drain)
16. Kitchen (inadequate kitchen e.g. not enough dishes, cooking essentials, etc.)
17. Parking (parking is far or difficult)

After quantifying these reasons further, I generated these data-driven tips for hosts to avoid getting negative review.  

1. Avoid emotional confrontations with guests at all costs. These can spill over into the reviews on your listing and drag down the overall rating. Instead remain professional, keep all communications on the platform, and do your best within reason to accommodate the guest.
2. Keep the list of amenities up to date and accurate. Nothing is worse for a guest than booking a listing for a specific amenity only to arrive and find it is missing or broken.
3. Ensure you have a seamless check in process. Any difficulties at check in can really bring down the overall rating.
4. Use an ozone machine or other method to minimize odors in your listing. Bad smells can lead to negative reviews and lower the overall rating.
5. Clean listings thoroughly between guests!. Areas requiring special attention include the kitchen and bathroom.
6. Ensure the thermostat works or consider giving guests access to it to minimize complaints about temperature.  
7. Make sure basic essentials are stocked up including toilet paper, cooking essentials, etc.
8. Communicate anything the guest needs to be aware of often before their arrival. For example, if there are special instructions about parking, do everything you can to bring it to a guest’s attention. Beyond including it in the written description of the listing, consider confirming with them by message that they are aware of these issues. How frequently these issues appear in reviews will tell you how hard you’ll need to work to make guests aware of them.

Some (or alot?) of this may be obvious, but I hope that by showing the data behind it it's at least interesting.

I even provided direct evidence of the listing to AirBnB rep of the identical listing after I got my reservation canceled. If the city sent them a memo not to do short term rentals they certainly shouldn't be on VRBO.

Airbnb,Increased price from 3k to 9k for 5 day stay,"My 2 friends and I booked an Airbnb for Coachella for April 2024 the day that the dates were released. After attending Coachella for the last 9 years, we like many others have come to realize you have to book the day the dates are released to get anything decently priced. We booked our Airbnb on June 13th and just got a message from the host today saying because it's a festival she needs to increase the price by $1800 a night (this is $7200 extra total) I explained to the host that if she would have canceled or messaged us right away we could have booked something else but now all of the other accommodations that were in our price range are now booked. The host messages me and says that she can decrease to $1500 per night or $6000 extra for 5 day stay and reiterated that still wont work for our price range. She then says the reason she didn't respond is because she is short staffed and because she had COVID. I own a business and I can't imagine passing off my mistake to my customer due not setting up coverage due to being sick. At this point I think we're both frustrated so I called Airbnb they advised me not to cancel due to the host having to honor the original booking. The host has now sent me a nasty message saying ""how I can't read"" etc ... the Airbnb customer service did mention that if they cancel they would block out those dates but obviously that doesn't stop them from using VRBO or another service. My question is should I be concerned about keeping this booking ? I've heard of hosts filing false complaints or harassing people ...

Airbnb,Three strikes with Airbnb will never book again. Host wants my credit card and signed rental agreement,"I booked a very scenic place months ago and less than 3 weeks during peak summer season the host cancelled claiming septic issues.  Then AirBnb offered a palsy amount for a coupon to rebook. I said really you can do better.  They raised to approximately one nights rental (not including tax and fees).

So I rebook another place in a different city.  The host then requests my credit card info and asks me to sign a rental agreement, giving them the rights to charge additional fees.   This just seemed very sketchy, so I call Airbnbnb to cancel and to get my coupon back.    I wait for hours for them to call back.  Meanwhile time is ticking and I have nowhere to go on my summer vacation.   I cannot rebook another place for the same days so I quit waiting and cancelled the booking myself.

I call Airbnb they said they cannot give me back the coupon because I cancelled the 2nd reservation!!  I felt like I was talking to some offshore support center, due to their accents and broken English.

Never mind that the coupon was to compensate for the host cancelling the orginal booking and I was cancelling the second due to sketchy request for my credit card and rental agreement.

Airbnb,"Chore Lists Out of Control, Back To Hotels [USA]","Recently booked a two night stay for a college visit on AirBNB. Booking was $400 with a $100 cleaning fee. $500 total.

After booking I get the list of house 'rules' including taking out the trash, doing dishes, and laundry on our morning of departure. Thinking about the 'chores' on our tight departure morning had me looking at hotels instead. 

We were pleasantly surprised by the Home 2 Suites and a Springhill Suites that family had recommended for a recent trip so we started looking at other options. STRs had been our go-to options for years. We found a 'suite' style room that fits our needs, without chores, for $350 total, so we cancelled the STR.

Airbnb,AirBnB now banning interior cameras in all properties [USA],"Article here: https://www.wired.com/story/airbnb-indoor-security-camera-ban/ 

Airbnb will soon ban hosts from watching their guests with indoor security cameras, as the company is reversing course on its surveillance policies.

As of April 30, hosts around the world must remove indoor cameras and disclose other outdoor monitoring tech to guests before they book. Airbnb previously allowed hosts to install security cameras in common areas of a home, like hallways and living rooms. But it also required hosts to disclose them, make them clearly visible, and keep the cameras out of places like sleeping areas and bathrooms.

Still, the cameras have been an issue. Guests have reported encountering hidden cameras in their short-term rentals. For hosts, the cameras can be a way to discourage guests from throwing large parties or to stop the gatherings before they become too disruptive. It’s a big enough concern that several companies have started making noise monitoring tech, billing themselves as solutions to protect short-term rentals.

But guests see them as an invasion of privacy—a watching eye intruding on their vacation.

“We're really grateful that Airbnb listened to those of us pushing back and calling for them to actually put safety and privacy first,” says Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a pro-privacy organization.

In its announcement, Airbnb said that the majority of its listings do not mention a security camera, so the rule change may not affect most listings. Vrbo, another short-term rental platform, already banned the use of visual and audio surveillance inside of properties.

Airbnb says it will investigate reported violations of the rule, and may penalize violators by removing their listings or accounts. But this policy may struggle to address the camera problem at large, as the company has already required hosts to disclose the indoor cameras, and guests have sometimes reported hidden and undisclosed cameras.

The new rules also require hosts to disclose to guests whether they are using noise decibel monitors or outdoor cameras before guests book. Both are used by some hosts to monitor properties for parties, which have continued to bring noise, damage, and danger even after Airbnb instituted a party ban and employed new anti-party tech to try to prevent revelers from booking on its site. Airbnb will also prohibit hosts from using outdoor cameras to monitor indoor spaces, and bars them from “certain outdoor areas where there’s a greater expectation of privacy,” such as outdoor showers and saunas, it says.

“This just emphasizes the fact that surveillance always gives a huge amount of power to whoever controls the camera system,” says Fox Cahn. “When it's used in a property you're renting, whether it's a landlord or an Airbnb, it's ripe for abuse.”",300,298,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1bc7hsa/airbnb_now_banning_interior_cameras_in_all/,2024-03-11 16:35:27,Vrbo

Airbnb,"Any AirBnB Hosts here that also use VRBO, and had an issue with a guest damaging something?","For the record, the VRBO sub is nonexistent, so I figure I would ask here. 

While AirBnB has AirCover included on bookings, which is great, VRBO only seems to have ""Damage Protection"" that guests have to pay for on their own- it's like $55 or something. I guess Hosts are supposed to coerce to get guests (who are trying to save money) to pay that- which never happens. 

Anyway, I know I'm likely out of luck here since I don't tell people to pay for the ""Damage Protection fee"" for a one bedroom cottage, and I also *don't* charge a security deposit!

That said, I wondered if I'm totally missing something (which I highly doubt I am), and want to know if anyone has had VRBO help get the Guest (or VRBO!) pay for the repair/replacement. 

The issue at hand is that the Guest had a child that was roughly 9 or 10 years old, and appeared to have mental disabilities. The child squeezed and scrunched the blinds in the bay window, which are about 7.5 to 8 feet long, and custom made.

The Guest admitted to her son damaging them, and offered going to Home Depot to buy some cheap ones, but that's jut not an option. As I said they are custom size and custom made- and certainly not cheap blinds you'd get at Home Depot.

Anyway, I just said they were custom made- and she remarked ""oh,"" and that was that. Obviously, she can't afford to pay for it. I thought this would be a cautionary tale, because for a long time I've been saying VRBO is way better than AirBnB. I guess it's not so great if people trash your residence (they trashed the whole place). My VRBO usually only attracts those 50 or older, which this Guest was, I just did not foresee a situation where it would get trashed. It's clear from the pictures on my listings that it's a ""fancy"" place- and the opposite of a place with Ikea furniture.

I will be going back to being strict on no children. I was just hoping I could make a claim for reimbursement without suing the Guest in small claims court- because I will not be doing that.",4,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/11b2uv9/any_airbnb_hosts_here_that_also_use_vrbo_and_had/,2023-02-24 21:37:33,Vrbo

Airbnb,VRBO host accusing me of things we did not do. What to do now?,"Hi all,

tl;dr Rented a kind of janky VRBO, host is accusing me of causing damage that was there when we arrived and lying to her. Unfortunately, I did not take any pictures or document anything upon our arrival.

Last weekend, a group of friends and I booked a VRBO rental. The host and I had been interacting pleasantly prior to the weekend, and everything seemed good. The rental was fine, although there were some slightly janky things about it: the outdoor grill was dirty and in poor condition, the screen porch was completely open on one side, the toilet seats were too small for the toilets, etc. I did not document any of this (big mistake), although I did keep a list of things to tell the host as feedback when we were done.

The owner also offered to rent us four kayaks for an additional fee. I wanted to go out on the lake, so I rented the kayaks, but ended up being unable to use them (the nearby resort wouldn't let us bring private craft to their docks). We ended up renting from the resort. I emailed the host to ask if they would consider refunding the additional fee for the kayaks, and explained why we were unable to use them.

Also, while we were there, there was an unfortunate accident that ended up melting some of the plastic on the indoor grill cover. I was going to email the host about this, but hadn't sent it yet when I got an email back about the kayak rental.

Apparently, she had emailed the kayak rental place at the resort, pretending to want to rent two boats from them and asking if it would be ok if she brought two additional boats of her own, and the rental company told her that was ok (it was the resort security that wouldn't let us bring in private boats, not the rental company). She then emailed me, accusing me of lying to her that the resort wouldn't let us bring the kayaks in, and telling me that I would have to pay for the melted grill cover (which is reasonable), the poor condition that the outdoor grill was left in, and a broken window latch.

We never used the outdoor grill (because it was in such bad condition when we got there), and we didn't break the window latch (I honestly have no idea how it got to be broken). We certainly didn't use the windows in any abnormal way.

I emailed her back and am trying to be civil, explain the miscommunication about the kayaks, take responsibility for the grill cover, and tell her that we did not damage the window or outdoor grill.

I hope that we can resolve this like adults, but if she continues to insist that we wrecked her house, is there any recourse I have, through VRBO or otherwise, to defend myself?

Airbnb,DO NOT BOOK WITH CYRUS MANLEY ON VRBO!!,"I booked a VRBO from Cyrus for parents weekend at ASU to go see my son. I communicated with him very early to make sure that he was a legit owner and he replied within a few days. I specifically said to him that I have been scammed on Vrbo before, and I wanted to make sure that he was a legit owner, he said he was, and not to worry. 

The day before we are scheduled to arrive and check in I messaged Cyrus and asked if we could have an early check-in, he did not reply, interestingly enough, the very next morning on the day we are supposed to check in I get a message that my Vrbo has been canceled, and all he writes in the message center is that someone is scheduled to fix the AC unit on Monday. Not a single comment that said he was sorry for the inconvenience and that he would put me in another unit or an apology of any kind. I of  course replied, in a not very happy way, and told him that I was going to report him to Vrbo, and that he is a fraud and karma is real. He then replies to me that he was considering putting me in a different location in a different VRBO rental, but because of how I responded, he was no longer considering it, I then just said, whatever.🙄

I’ve seen these types of scams before where they book you in this fabulous location, great clean property and then last minute they have to cancel on you, “but oh!”, they can put you at a different location at one of their other VRBO rentals. 
First of all, I booked this specific property because of its location to the football and hockey arena at ASU, so another location would not be an option. Secondly, the fact that he chose to tell me there was a problem with the AC in the unit the day that we are supposed to check in seems ridiculous to me and screams poor management skills. 

I contacted VRBO and made them aware of the situation, but really at the end of the day, all they can do is give me my money back, I guess it’s better then nothing. Just really inconvenient and frustrating that my husband and I are having to find a place to stay the day we get here.

Airbnb,Hey AirBNB/Vrbo - Include cleaning fees in the nightly rate,"I dont know who at these two companies need to hear this, but include cleaning and service fees in the advertised rate... its such a simple back end fix. Hear me out!

Host portal: host inputs nightly rate and the cleaning fee per stay (doesnt matter if 1 night or 15 nights) lets say 300/night and $120 cleaning fee. Plus the 14.2

Guest Portal: guest searches for 4 nights at a 3/2 home on Airbnb. Sees a price of 388/night. Decides that for 3 bedroom home this price is much better than the (3) 1 bedrooms hotels rooms they'd need at 150/night plus no paid parking and a full kitchen/back yard.

The click ""Reserve"" and see that taxes are now added per the location, but the 388/night price includes: 
-300/night for the stay
-120 flat cleaning fee
-14.2% platform and service fees

This is exactly what hotels do, but because they work on scale and have a full time cleaning staff. They make profit on this cleaning staff because they know theres a fixed cost to running the hotel. This is harder for STVR hosts since every stay has the same cleaning fee and no one is full time (cant average it out when no other cleanings are going on every day)

How do we get these services to make the decision process for guests less ""bait and switch"" and hosts able to charge the appropriate fixed costs into their listing?

Airbnb,VRBO Calendar Sync blocking my AirBnB availability,"I recently added a VRBO listing for my STR unit (already on AirBnB) and set up the calendar sync.  I didn't block any dates, but I did add a 2 night minimum stay on VRBO, same as I have on AirBnB.  Since then I have not been getting any bookings because both calendars are now blocked completely.  Why?  Because VRBO interprets the 2 night requirement as ""it's not possible to book any single night"", so therefore ALL your days are blocked.  I change it to 1 night minimum and voila, all the dates are unblocked.  But that's not what I want.  It's a 45 minute wait for Chat support, and 15 for phone support. So I decide I'm not going to do VRBO.  However, nowhere on the site or the internet are there instructions for removing a listing.  How do you love them apples?  No doubt it can be done and I'm currently on hold waiting, but seriously VRBO?",3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/10058m5/vrbo_calendar_sync_blocking_my_airbnb_availability/,2022-12-31 22:23:06,Vrbo
Airbnb,Accidentally booked on both Air BnB and VRBO,"Hi all, I'm asking this for a friend (seriously!). My coworker's sister, who's not especially tech-savvy, accidentally booked a reservation for the same house, on the same dates, on both AirBnB and VRBO. She made the AirBnB reservation first, but her computer started acting up and a confirmation page never loaded. Thinking the reservation didn't go through, she hopped over to VRBO and booked the same property for the same dates. Almost immediately she realized she'd been charged by both AirBnB and VRBO, and contacted each company, described the issue, and was told that only the host could cancel a reservation. She contacted the host numerous times and he's been very unresponsive. At first he said he'd look into how to cancel one of the reservations, but now it's been months and my coworker's sister has not seen any refund. She tried to dispute the duplicate charge with her credit card company, but was told that too much time had passed for her to make a dispute (and the reason why it took her so long is because she was trying to resolve the issue with the host first). 

Has anyone heard of this issue happening before? Is there any advice I can relay to the woman?",16,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/f9yfvi/accidentally_booked_on_both_air_bnb_and_vrbo/,2020-02-26 19:15:08,Vrbo
Airbnb,Airbnb search changes. Do you use either VRBO or bookings.com and if so does it help?,"I started listening to the airbnb automated you tube channel and he talked about how airbnb has changed how searches show up. One example was that the more eclectic places are what airbnb is focusing on  and (supposedly) newcomers to airbnb be be seeing these types of places right off the bat.  He mentioned that listing titles are no longer the driving force or even seen in searches.  He could be wrong but he seems to be quite successful and not sure why he would lie about these new changes. 

Anyhow, what I took from what he said was that newcomers to airbnb site probably wont find a more normal listing as easily and that vrbo and bookings dot com sites are what you need to bring people to your listing.

Thoughts?  I've looked at booking site and it looks kinda sterile and difficult, vrbo looks nicer but that doesn't mean anything I suppose.

Airbnb,New Ownership - Host Cancelation VRBO,"I bought a house in Costa Rica that I plan to rent out part of the year. The previous owner has been less than open about the existing reservations. We agreed to honor them but every time he sends us info about them it’s different. Dates don’t match, amounts etc. I’m fed up and want him to cancel them and I’ll rebook with the guests. He’s refusing to cancel and also throws in there that we’ll get penalties. I’m 99% certain that’s not the case. Those bookings aren’t with me and Vrbo and Airbnb don’t transfer them.  I have no obligation to honor them. I have zero obligation to even rent my house. What if I was going to live in ot?

Anyway, I’d like to make this as painless as possible for our guests and I also do not want to get a bad review because he has zero ability to send me the correct totals the guests paid (bc the amounts will be sent to him and he has to transfer them to me), or the dates they are arriving.

Airbnb,Do guests have a score or profile on VRBO?,"The question is a little more involved.  I booked a VRBO yesterday.

To be clear, this was the listed price, it's not that they undercharged me.

VRBO confirmed the error and confirmed it was their fault.  The host asked me to either pay the 20% higher amount (an additional $2300) which I don't want to do, or asked me to cancel.  I don't want to cancel because I don't want my profile to get dinged for canceling when none of this was my fault.  There would be no cancellation fee.

Airbnb,AirBnB and VRBO price difference,"Hello everyone!

I just recently launched my first STR through AirBnB. I am using Hospitable for the automated guest communication and PriceLabs for the dynamic pricing. I was able to sync everything together so that the pricing shown in Hospitable is being pushed to AirBnB.

Now, I added the property to VRBO in order to maximize exposure but I'm having an issue with the pricing. I added the property to Hospitable and PriceLabs and was able to get the pricing worked out there. I then linked the two properties together in Hospitable so that the calendars and pricing were synced. However, when I check the VRBO calendar, the pricing is very different than the AirBnB calendar and for the life of me I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.

Airbnb,AirBnB vs. VRBO payment question,"

Hi y’all. As someone new to VRBO from AirBnB I wanted to make sure it was normal to do all payment through the property manager and not VRBO itself. 

On AirBnB it all goes through the app without having to exchange any payment info through the host, which has made me feel more secure. 

Our property manager for this VRBO sent us a contract that says “Final Payment can be made by Personal Check, E-Check or Money Order in US Funds. (e-Checks are available for US banks only.) Visa, Mastercard and American Express are also accepted, however, incur a 3.5% processing fee.”

Airbnb,VRBO tax payment issue,"Although not related to AirBnB, I thought i'd shoot this post on here as it may be related.

I have a property listed on VRBO, and VRBO was collecting 13% tax on behalf of my listing (I had to manually add these taxes), and disbursed these taxes directly to me (which will be remitted to the government when it's due) since I listed my property one year ago.

Recently, at the end of Jan 2022, I noticed that VRBO's platform stopped collecting the 13% taxes from the guests, and they did not notify me of the change, nor do I know when exactly this change was effected (I suspect it was at the end of 2021). I clicked into the dashboard into the Taxes tab which was essentially overhauled and cleared any pre-existing preferences off of my listing.

Now, I have accepted 8 new bookings since the tax collection tab was overhauled, and have not been collecting the 13% tax. I've reached out to all of these customers, and most have been receptive to paying an additional 13% tax, but one guest refuses and I've told them to cancel but they refuse.

I've called customer support to dispute this in order to allow me to cancel without being penalized and they basically said that this was my fault and that I should be aware of any changes that occur on the platform. Now mind you, I check my VRBO account regularly but because of how inconspicious the tax line item is in the reservations payments details, I wasn't able to catch the change until now.

The customer support rep that I was talking to was incredibly dismissive and blamed me for not noticing the change, and took no responsibility nor did they provide any solutions.

Airbnb,I will never use Airbnb again (Nightmare Guest and horrible customer service),"I will start by saying that I’ve been hosting on airbnb for 3.5 years and have a 90 reviews with a 4.90 star rating. My property has two homes on one lot and I live in the small front unit while the Airbnb home is in a nice private lot behind my home. It was a great ride but airbnbs customer service is a joke these days and will not do anything to help the host, even when they are threatened from a guest. 

Here’s the story:

I received a last minute instant-booking Monday at 6 pm and my cleaners car broke down earlier and communicated that they’d be really late (usually cleanings are completed by 3 pm) 

I let the guest know about the situation and communicated that my wife and I will be cleaning the home to have it ready by 8 pm for the guest (We cleaned the home for a whole year before hiring professional cleaners). 

I offered a $100 credit towards their stay and let them know if that wasn’t enough, they are able to cancel due to the inconvenience. 

I didn’t receive a message back on Airbnb so I decided to call the gentlemen to alert him in case he wasn’t aware of the situation, but the phone number is disconnected. I sent a text message anyways so I had proof that I tried reaching out in different ways. 

I made sure to communicate when we were nearing completion and sent a message on Airbnb at 8 pm alerting the guest that the home was ready. 

I still didn’t receive a response so I tried calling a few more times, but left it alone since it was late. 

The next morning rolls by and still no guest.

Odd. 

I thought it was potentially a company that booked it since I’ve had a few past guests miss the first night. 

Next day at 11:30 am, the guest sent a disturbing and scary message. 

“I need cancellation I need my money Place back in my account all I need another place of my choice with a week's extension for free for the hassle and the b******* for sleeping on the streets with my kids the whole nine yards last night it was b******* I've never been through this before with you guys I need to know something now. 

I need to know the f****** proper address and yes I would like at least two to three days of extra for the f****** b******* that we had to go through you don't understand me and my kids were sleeping in the truck on the side of the road in the neighborhood we have no no nothing about okay that's not too much to ask for and I need the address that just I got was 845 okay there was no 845 we walked all over the damn place we even ask people on the street no one knew what was that we couldn't find it otherwise I want my full refund. 

So what are we doing I'm sitting here waiting for some kind of answer I'm tired of waiting I'm tired of all this s*** I need to know something now.”

My wife and I instantly felt scared and threatened as we had to host this crazy guy for 5 nights. 

Those message came from nowhere and we instantly wanted to cancel to get this guy away. We attempted to cancel but airbnb doesn’t allow us to cancel during a stay. So I called customer service and my god…. 

I spoke to 10 different airbnb specialists (I’m not kidding) to have this guy’s booking canceled but they said that they’d investigate and get back to me in a hour or two. 

Every single agent said the same exact thing for the next 4 days. I have screenshots of everything. 

The crazy guy then roamed my entire property knocking on my own private home, my windows, and into my backyard to find us.

My wife and I have never felt more scared in our entire lives. 

I told airbnb to contact him and let him know that he’ll get his money back and to leave my property right away. They never contacted him. 

I messaged him that he is no longer allowed on the property and he needs to call airbnb. If he started acting more threatening, I was going to call the police. 

There’s a lot more to this story but In a nutshell:

Airbnb did nothing to resolve it as he continued to send disturbing messages to me via airbnb message, text and a voicemail from a random number. Airbnb finally called me on the last night asking if I can cancel and give the money back to the guest… on the last night. Oh, and I would lose super host status for canceling. 

They literally told me that it is what it is and we’re sorry. 

I let them know that I’ll be exposing their terrible airbnb protocols in order to change their business model to help protect and assist hosts and future guests from any threatening or scary situations. They apologized in the most unauthentic way and said can we help you with anything else? 

I hung up. 

Please be safe everyone. Airbnb is NOTHING like before and if you have any issues, you’ll get screwed. 

I’m using VRBO and Booking.com until I can rent the home out.

Airbnb,"Airbnb does not care about customers, only hosts who pay the listing fees.","I’ve now had two separate property owners cancel on bookings. The first was made 6 months ago with deposit fully paid. The owner of this first cottage cancelled the booking 3 months later with no explanation given.

Now, 3 months later the 2nd cottage owner has notified us they intend to sell the property and cannot commit to the booking. We are left in limbo waiting to hear if the property sold, meanwhile nothing comparable is available. 

Airbnb doesn’t care at all about the customer. They simply make sure the deposit is refunded.  I feel that they should assist the customer in finding comparable options and make the customer whole.

Advice?,"I posted this to the Host Subbreddit with no luck... wondering if anybody here has had something like this happen them. I operate/manage several STRs in San Antonio.

The software had been great (especially for managing cleaners) until I found out this morning that I have a few over lapping bookings between VRBO and AirBnb. I’m still in the early stages of figuring out who’s at fault (Me, AirBnb, VRBO or AirGMS). 

One of the overlapping bookings coming up next month (a 2 week VRBO booking that’s overlapping two AirBnb bookings) is going to be extremely costly. I’m unsure how to proceed. I’m fairly confident the fault lies with AirGMS because they were beta testing some kind of full VRBO integration and when I google for info about a calendar glitch between the platforms nothing recent pops up. So I’m guessing this isn’t something wide spread. Has anything like this ever happens to anybody? Assuming AirGMS is responsible for not properly syncing my VRBO calendar... is this going to be a acceptable excuse for having to cancel a guest? Am I just going to have to bite the bullet and drop down the rankings in VRBO? If I cancel a guest will all my houses take a hit or just that one property? Any insight would be much appreciated.

Airbnb,New VRBO/HomeAway service fee,"I am a VRBO host - I know this is an Airbnb forum, but we face many of the same issues.   

I chose VRBO because they charged an annual $399 subscription to list my property and then no booking fees (outside of credit card processing fees).

Today, I responded to an enquiry and found they had added a ""service fee"" of more than 10% to my quote.  Supposedly this is a charge to the traveller but I have mostly Canadian guests who are already reeling from the currency exchange (CDN$ at .7 US$) and I discount my rates for most Canadian bookings this year.  This means that fee will be coming out of the money I make!

This seems to be a breach of contract to me (but of course their Terms and Conditions say they can change these things).  I can advertise on Airbnb or TripAdvisor for free and pay the per booking fee.  I am six months into my one year subscription and they are unilaterally changing our agreement.

I waited 30 minutes to talk to a rep who know exactly why I was calling.  He said:  ""No, they won't remove the service charge from my booking or give me a pro-rated refund.""  He also mentioned they would be monitoring booking to see if hosts moved them ""off-site"" for payment to avoid service fee.

They announced this change in an monthly email they send out that absolutely did not make it clear that a fee would apply to subscription listings.  It was buried at the bottom of their January email that highlighted their new TV ad!

Airbnb,Host cancelled on me and referred to a law that doesn’t exist [USA],"Hi everyone, just looking on opinions on how to proceed here. Basically I booked a VRBO in March 2024 in Newport RI, for my family to come from around the country and stay at for my February 2025 wedding. All was well and good and the host sent me a congratulations message on the app. 

Yesterday the host cancelled my reservation and told me that Newport RI passed a law only allows short term rentals of 30+ days. I understand that’s a push for some communities and I get it—but that’s not a law here. We even called the City of Newport itself and gave them the address for the VRBO and they confirmed that the property is in now way limited to a 30+ day rental law. They even sent screenshots of their internal property lookups to prove it.

My question is do I have any course of action here with VRBO? Is there any way to get the host to honor the rental still or is that a lost cause. It’s about 60 days from my Wedding and the chances of finding something A) Large enough B) Available or C) Reasonably priced is near zero. The whole reason to book that far out is to lock in a good rate!

Would such a loop create weird problems? How much lag should I expect between syncs? Is there a way to automatically trigger syncs on either platform?

Airbnb,Hosts should not require guests to clean towels and linens,"Here’s my rant. I’m staying at an AirBnB we’re the host has a guest policy that all used towels, linens and dishes must be cleaned and put away before you leave. This means we are spending our last day of vacation doing chores. 

To make matters worse, the previous guests did not appropriately wash everything so some of the towels are sticky, the couch throws are itchy and the bed sheets smell like mens cologne.

The dishes in the cabinet were filthy and had grease residue on them. We basically had to spend personal money buying cleaning products so we could re-clean everything when we arrived. Now we have to do it all over again before we leave.

We realized this happens anytime we stay at an AirBnB with the “clean your own stuff” policy. The ones with cleaning services are much more polished and the linens are always cleaner or new.

If you are a host, I’m begging you to PLEASE just hire professional cleaning services as a hygienic courtesy for guests.",334,128,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/u9er4r/hosts_should_not_require_guests_to_clean_towels/,2022-04-22 13:31:19,Vrbo

Airbnb,Being charged $1400 for damage I didn't do. Airbnb says they'll charge my card in about 11 days [USA],"Really disappointed with this whole experience as it seems like Airbnb blindly sides with the host with these damage claims. I got charged an outrageous $1400 in damage which I didn't do and after multiple appeals Airbnb says that they've made their decision that the claim is valid and will charge my credit card soon. I don't care if my account gets banned at this point. I was originally planning to cancel my CC / report as stolen so I can't be charged but now I'm worried that they'll follow through with reporting this case to a debt collections agency.

Anyone have any recent experience with something like this? I really just want to be done with this whole situation. Do I have to worry about collections coming after me? Is there a better way to navigate this? I unfortunately did not take many videos and pictures so of course I don't have any proof to defend myself. Although I think any reasonable person would agree that the damage claim is outrageous so I hope it would play out well for me in court but I don't want to think about it getting that far.

EDIT: Wow this got a lot more attention than I expected. I'm not sure if anyone missed my reply with some details of the claims but I c+v here again so it's more visible.

Some of the **evidence pics** here which were used in the claim against me: [https://imgur.com/a/yxSq85P](https://imgur.com/a/yxSq85P)

To sum it up, one was ""damage"" to the bed frame, some sag in one of the corners which I didn't do. Claiming $600 for that.

Another was damage to the flooring, when I moved in I took the exercise puzzle mat flooring off the floors and put down my own carpets. The mats weren't glued down or anything and I was careful with putting it back when I left. They claimed $550 for this. The pictures taken were all of after my stay (except there one where my carpet is there, the host barged in without my permission to take that picture). I'm not sure how Airbnb support came to the conclusion that $550 worth of damage was done to the flooring just from those pics.

And another small thing with the mattress cover. This one I'm ok with since I did spill a little juice on it. I don't think the cover needs to be 100% replaced but hey if I'm only paying for that it's much better than the whole $1400.

If Airbnb would be willing to come to a compromise and take off the charges for the flooring and bed frame I would be happy to pay the rest off to settle this whole ordeal. But I'm not sure if that's possible at this point. I'm trying to contact them but it doesn't seem to be helping much.",20,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1e6p1bw/being_charged_1400_for_damage_i_didnt_do_airbnb/,2024-07-18 23:14:03,Vrbo
Airbnb,Cancellation: Host cancelled without warning - Relisted at 2x the price [Quebec],"My family (3 of us) booked an airbnb in Quebec for June 5th - 10th next year as we have tickets to the 2024 F1 Montreal GP. This past week our host suddenly cancelled without any warning and has totally ghosted us. I just looked at the listings and our dates have been relisted for twice the price. We also found it listed on VRBO, so the host is posting the property to multiple sites. Given the GP brings a lot of tourism, prices all around the city have since skyrocketed 2-3x for every hotel and Airbnb, which is significantly out of our price range for 5 nights.

Is this allowed? I feel like it's totally unethical. We've reached out to airbnb for an investigation, but is there anything else that can be done? Any advice is appreciated.

Edit - Thanks everyone for the suggestions. It's a bummer hearing others' negative experiences.  We are waiting to hear back from F1 customer service regarding a refund. Not holding our breath though because I believe they have a no refund policy - doesn't hurt to ask. Also waiting to hear back from AirBnB about their investigation. Nothing set in stone, still weighing the options.

Edit Edit - we haven't heard back from AirBnB but the listing is no longer on the website for those dates, so fingers crossed AirBnB removed it.",62,108,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1614fpl/cancellation_host_cancelled_without_warning/,2023-08-25 16:45:32,Vrbo
Airbnb,A host is trying to make me pay for something that broke by itself,"Hi, me and my girlfriend went on vacation in France and booked a reservation through AirBNB to a cheap place with a great mountain view in the Alpes. 

The place was advertised with multiple pictures showing the nice mountain view through the main window. Upon arrival the main window had a huge rolling shutter blocking the view. I decide check if the host had any instructions on how to lift it up but she didn’t mention it at all. It was a place were the host wouldn’t go to clean after people used it, it was up to the people renting to make sure the place was clean. She didn’t meet us there, she was basically letting the place run itself without going there at all. 

In order to lift the rolling shutters I figured I would use the 2 handles at the bottom of it. After about 2 feet it got stuck and wouldn’t move either way. Then out of nowhere it literally broke in half. The host then apologized and told us that somebody would come fix it the next day. 6 days later she sent us a bill for 953$. After refusing to pay and explaining to airBNB the whole story they said it was our fault even though we did absolutely nothing.

Airbnb,"ALWAYS take pics when you leave, to be on the safe side [US]","I just got home from an Airbnb trip to the middle of nowhere for the 4th of July, to get away from the fireworks. My dog hates them, and where i live, people set them off for 10+ days, so we go out of town for the bulk of it. 

The place was great in spite of a few things, e.g. the ceiling fans not working, low water pressure, a mouse in the house. And! There was a wood stove with a long pipe up to the ceiling and out. Loud noises started coming from it - long story short, a bird flew in and got stuck, and I messaged the host who sent their local caretaker to help out. He opened the flue and then left, so I waited until the bird popped out and got it outside. So I met the caretaker - an old guy, seemed nice enough other than complaining about ""people who come out to the country and don't realize there's wildlife!"" Okay, whatever. 

None of that's a big deal of course, so I get home and am writing up a glowing review when I get a message from the host. Who copied and pasted a message from the caretaker, saying that ""the bed pillows were thrown in the corner"" (a lie, I put them on a chair), ""the pet vomited on the carpet,"" ""there was dog food all over,"" ""a scratch on the table from the dog"" (my dog is too small to reach the tabletop) and all this other bullshit. Claiming it took him FOUR HOURS to clean. And...none of it was true. In fact, I left the place so clean that I seriously thought to myself ""ha, there's nothing left to clean!"" I liked the place, liked the host who seemed very chill, appreciated the noon checkout, so I spent the morning cleaning up more than I normally would. Did dishes and put them away, was there long enough to do laundry and get it in the dryer, scrubbed the kitchen so counters and all were sparking clean, and even swept (so no, there was no pet vomit and no food!). Made sure everything was pristine. I didn't take pics because I generally don't, and so I just forgot. 

It was really a bummer to get this message, after it had been such a great stay. I couldn't figure out where these lies were coming from, but then it occurred to me - there really WAS nothing much to do. There were two bedrooms, I only used one. Had cleaned and put everything away, etc. But this guy wanted to get paid, so he made shit up.

Airbnb,"FYI: Don't book an Airbnb for your wedding [Portland, OR]","Just wanted to post something because it's been eating me up all day. Almost a year ago to date we booked an Airbnb to act as the hub for all of our wedding activities. My (future) wife and I were planning to stay there for the week, host a small rehearsal dinner (immediate family only) / play board games, and host the family the morning of the wedding while we get ready.

We confirmed with the host that this would be okay with them and they stated everything was ok as long as we kept the number of cars in the driveway to a certain number. We agreed and booked the reservation and haven't heard anything from them. We paid our final payment about two weeks ago and everything looked good.

We got a call from Airbnb support this morning that the host canceled at us, 48 hours before check-in. Airbnb offered $100 credit on a booking $2500 or more. They also offered to search for a new home, but within an hour said there were no comps nearby and we were on our own. We are now scrambling to find a place before we fly out to Portland on Wednesday as options are extremely limited and prices have gone WAY up. 

I'm extremely disappointed in this whole scenario - the Airbnb cost $3K and we booked with a super host with extremely high reviews for both this property and others. It's also listed as a Luxe / Guest Favorite. The host has given very little context as to why it happened, only that ""her hands are tied"" and ""the HOA and city is against me"". This absolutely sucks and is the last thing I wanted to be doing 2 days before my wedding. Lesson learned, don't trust Airbnb for very important stays.

Airbnb,"may have fucked up, purchased vacation stay at airbnb for friend [USA]","**The situation:**

Paid for airbnb for my son and his friends to vacation in as a christmas gift. I will not be staying in it. 

It is for him, we share an account. 

He will be there to go surfing and hiking. they don’t smoke. yes they will probably have a reasonable amount of beers, off premise. 

**The problem:**

i now see the airbnb requires the purchaser of the property to be 30 years old. 30 years old?!?!? I totally get it as a property owner, but think this is a little extreme. but what do i know... but i get having a 26 age limit in some areas. 

My son and his friends are 29 haha. They’re not rowdy (different story at 23 lol). I guarantee they won’t cause an issue. won’t even be at the house. but i understand a property owner having more info and less trust. 

so i bought it (i clear the age limit), and my son and friends will attend. this seems like it is not the hosts wishes. 

**what to do:**

ugh so there are end more airbnbs in this area and i waited too long anyways before i learned this. 

(i think it’s kinda shitty they waited until the last second to tell me this) they don’t know that i won’t attend but i properly listed the amount of guests and paid in full. 

is this a non-issue? do i let them proceed with the stay? Do i let the host know? would hosts really rather cancel a months ahead of time and reimburse rather than proceeding with the stay? honest question. judgement free zone.

Airbnb,AirBnB host trying to raise price after booking once they realized there is an event occurring that weekend [France],"I will be travelling to Monaco for the Formula 1 Grand Prix next year. We just booked a beautiful AirBnB in Nice, that was pretty expensive but worth it. 

After booking we received the automated message from the host that they are excited to host us etc. A few hours later they message us saying they didn't realize that weekend was the race and they want to increase the price. This place was already the most expensive one out of the options we explored so we are unwilling to spend any more money. It's not the end of the world as we have other options, but I am rather annoyed. Can I get any recourse from AirBnB? 

I'm not looking to screw over the host but I think its bad faith tactics to do something like this. Even if I could force them to host us at the previously paid for price, I wouldn't want to be dealing with a disgruntled host. Additionally, will it negatively impact me to cancel it, or should I request the host cancel it?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for chiming in. I ultimately am going to find another option, but I will request the host process the cancellation. As I said I'm not looking to force the host to allow me to stay at the price I paid. I don't want to deal with a disgruntled host or worry about the possibility of them cancelling at the last minute and leaving me without anywhere to stay, because as many people have said it is a very high possibility.

Also to clarify regarding AirCover, I was told the way it works is it kicks in if the issue occurs while I am staying at the property. In this case, because I knew about the issue beforehand, aircover would not apply & airbnb could just cancel the reservation.


Hey folks,

TL;DR: The host/owner of a property I booked removed a crucial amenity after I had already signed the contract. Airbnb support has confirmed that this edit to the listing happened after I booked. What do i do?


Context:

I booked an staycation for my family and I (10 of us with many age ranges) about 1.5 months ago. Where I am staying is going to be very hot so I specifically chose a place with AC. AC was non negotiable and I booked quite out of the way just to have it — most homes in this area don’t have it and the age ranges of family make it a necessity. 

As I looked yesterday, just a few days before trip, the listing no longer offers AC. I contacted airbnb support and they confirmed that the host did indeed change the the AC amenity after I booked, which I have in email confirmation from them as well.

The host is a 3rd party company (Vacasa, for those familiar with it).

Given that its only a few days prior to the trip, not going is not an option. We have booked activities there, folks have taken off from work, etc.

My goal is to hopefully have airbnb find an equivalent comp with AC — which may be tough in 2 days notice. If not that, I would at the very least, like the host/owner to comp me appropriately. I find it ridiculous that a host can change a crucial amenity after someone has booked. The property is no longer what I signed the legal contract for.

What should I do in this situation? Should i wait for airbnb to contact the host and get back to me or call them myself? What is a reasonable compensation? 50% off? full refund? 

Any input/advice is welcome! thank you!",99,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/15ejp24/host_changed_crucial_amenity_after_i_booked/,2023-07-31 15:44:18,Vrbo
Airbnb,Being asked to cancel multiple listings from our end. Is this a scam? [USA],"We are trying to book a room for Atlanta on Labor Day weekend for DragonCon - the gauntlet of room renting - and have had a problem with a listing.  We found a room for a great price and booked it, only to be contacted by the seller and told it was listed at the wrong price and if we would cancel.  They also asked us to contact them outside the app.  We refused to do both.

Months later, the seller canceled and his account was gone.  We found another cheap listing on VRBO and booked, only to be contacted by the Same Person!! Again asking us to cancel on our end because they listed at the wrong price.

Either this person is incredibly inept, or this is a scam.  However, I don't know how listing a place at a cheap price, then asking the person to cancel from the consumer side would generate money.  Does anyone have insight about what is happening?

EDIT: If this information helps, on Air B&B we we're contacted to cancel a week after booking, on VRBO it was within minutes of booking.

Airbnb,"Accountability at Airbnb, This is Sad [USA]","We may be done with Airbnb after dozens of overwhelmingly positive guest experiences over many years. Yesterday my husband and I arrived to our booking, one half of a duplex. It was already occupied by a couple that had arrived just minutes earlier. Their door code worked. Ours was a different door code and did not work. In an attempt to resolve,  I called and left a voicemail for the host and sent a text through the app asking for immediate help, while still on the property. Nothing. It was getting dark so we left and scrambled to make other arrangements for the next 3 nights. I initiated contact with Airbnb online asking for a full refund. 2.5+ hours later the host finally texts back. As it turned out, the couple that checked into our unit was booked for the other half of the duplex, but was able to occupy our unit because their code worked. We were offered their unit by the host, but now we have already secured other accomodations, and we're not amenable between the fact our door code didn't work and we got absolutely no response from the host for over 2.5 hours. All we wanted at this point was a prompt refund. What transpired over the next 24 hours is why I have lost faith in Airbnb. The hosts messages to me were coming from a cell phone and not through the app. They would not cancel the reservation, but wanted me to cancel. I screenshotted the messages and forwarded them to Airbnb. The communication from Airbnb online was also abysmal. Finally with no refund 24 hours later, I called them. What I discovered was that Airbnb also didn't want to force their host to cancel because they would be penalized. If a host isn't penalized for this situation, when would they be? They screwed up by giving us a faulty door code, giving another guest our door code, then leaving us out to dry for hours. I had to INSIST that the rep cancel the reservation. We have now been notified the full refund is in process, but Airbnb's standards have clearly fallen. I do not forsee much of a future for them if they drag their feet on fixing urgent guest situations and fail to hold hosts accountable.",50,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/18vpmpn/accountability_at_airbnb_this_is_sad_usa/,2024-01-01 05:12:35,Vrbo
Airbnb,"Concerned about being left high and dry in the desert - WWYD service dog edition [Indio, California]","I am a long time booker with airbnb and also someone who has a service dog. I have seen a lot of posts about hosts complaining about service dogs, and I understand people who take advantage of the system are mainly at fault here. I typically book pet friendly stays regardless, to save piece of mind for me and the host. Today, I had a stay cancelled on me for this weekend, in a rather remote area, due to plumbing issues. I was able to find another spot, for a bit more money out of pocket, but it clearly states no pets a few times. I booked it out of concern for not having a place to stay but now I’m unsure if I should give the host a heads up about the service dog. My dog is well trained, I have no concern for her behavior or cleanliness and would prefer to give a friendly heads up out of respect. At the same time, I am also aware I do not *need* to let the host know ahead of time. 

Unfortunately, I shared this with a host in the past and they cancelled on me due that reason, and then changed the story and said the A/C broke. I found it to be a shame, but reported to airbnb and rebooked elsewhere. Seeing as I do not have the same opportunity with relatively no other places available, I am nervous this will happen again. Should I let them know and hope they do the right thing and take it up with airbnb if my entire weekend is ruined and I’m displaced in the desert? Or should I proceed without mentioning it, as is my right under ADA out of concern for discrimination? WWYD

TLDR - Disabled with a service dog. Pet friendly host cancelled on me last minute, had to rebook another place that is not pet friendly. Do I let the host know I have a service animal or disclose only if they bring it up?

ETA: It is an entire home listing

UPDATE: thank you to whoever suggested have a friend test our messaging her, I did so and felt comfortable with the response so I let her know. It didn’t sit well with me to not let her know, but I was very stressed about not having accommodations. She did say she may charge an additional cleaning fee if there’s hair, which isn’t allowed under airbnb or ADA, but I will cross that bridge if we come to it.

Airbnb,"1 Star Airbnb, just wish I could suspend them instead of the other way around [CA, USA]","I self list a 2nd home we have in South Lake Tahoe, and use a cleaning staff in between guests to keep it up to snuff. We have 100-200 bookings per year, keeping it nearly constantly occupied. A great location, large townhome on the lake itself. I manage to maintain a 4.8 and superhost but slipped a little last quarter to 4.78, thanks to a guest in June who fancied themselves an experienced and demanding guest, complaining about every aspect of the unit and 2 starring the place overall. We contested her claims and got it corrected in the public review, however the rating stayed.  
The issue today is that I just got an email saying that the listing is suspended:  
""After multiple issues and warnings, your listing has been suspended as of September 1, 2023. This means your listing won’t appear in search results, and you can’t accept new reservations.  
On September 6, you’ll be able to reactivate your listing by reviewing and agreeing to our ground rules. If you haven’t taken the time to fix these listing issues yet, now’s the time.""  
Keep in mind it's a surprise to me, as I am on track for superhost with a 4.8 this quarter. Turns out all it takes are 3 ""Review Incidents"" to suspend your account. My overly critical guest was one, and 2 reviews that gave me 5 stars down the board except for a ""1 star"" in cleaning. The first being a legitimate mistake by my cleaners (a scheduling failure of the clean on a back to back so guests arrived to a home dirty from the guests who checked out the same day) - The guests left happy because when they arrived they called me and I fully refunded their cleaning fee and sent a crew over in the middle of the night (they arrived at 8pm) to change the sheets and clean the unit for free, but still decided to 1 star cleaning because of the state at arrival. And a recent guest who found that there were sticky plates on the shelves (possibly previous guests poorly washed and stored them).  
But I'm suspended now, nothing I can do to get a human review, and we lose revenue. I'm pissed and needed to vent. There will be those that say ""List on VRBO"", but VRBO (or others) are 25% less revenue, so Airbnb has me in the bag. Not to mention there is an API issue with my account that they have been unable to fix that prevents me from blocking dates on my Airbnb calendar using imported calendars from other services, so if I list on another service as well I risk double booking >:|",15,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/167jzdh/1_star_airbnb_just_wish_i_could_suspend_them/,2023-09-01 21:41:03,Vrbo
Airbnb,"Airbnb being discriminatory against age when trying to book on Halloween weekend [Ontario, Canada]","Every year I host a Halloween party at my house and I have a group of friends that come from out of town to attend the party. Usually, they book a hotel to stay at for the night because I don’t have the room to accommodate them at my house after the party is over. This year however, the hotel prices in the area skyrocketed so they turned to Airbnb to seek a place to stay for the night. Little did I know this would be a week long ordeal for us back and forth with Airbnb support. My friends and I are all 24 years old. No matter which account we tried booking from, the booking would be denied because us booking it “could lead to an unauthorized party in the home”. 3 of my friends and I all tried from our individual accounts. We all have positive account ratings with past hosts and some even with extensive stay history. At first we suspected it was possible that host that was rejecting us somehow so we reached out to them. They said they could not accept the booking request from their end but had no issue having us at their property. We tried to book 3 separate properties from 3 different hosts all with the same outcome. 

Then we decided to individually call Airbnb support and give the same story about not being able to book. We explained that we had no intention of hosting a party in the house and we’d simply be using it to sleep. The support team member would create a ticket with a “specialized team” that would contact us via email within 24 hours. All 4 of us got identical emails. They look like [this](https://imgur.com/a/QGijrbS). No option to dispute the matter further. If you try calling support back, they’ll say they can’t do anything. Now we’re stuck with no affordable place for my friends to stay. Just for shits and giggles, I ask my Mom to try booking one of the properties from her account. Well, without hesitation the booking gets approved. She has even less of a stay history than some of my friends do. Still, the property gets booked with no issues. I was shocked. The only factor I can think of to deny us would be our age. It’s absolutely ridiculous that Airbnb can assume that because we’re 24, we are automatically going to throw a party. That’s insane! We are all responsible normal 24 year olds with jobs and educations. Furthermore, shouldn’t we be held accountable if something bad were to happen? Isn’t that the whole point of Airbnb taking information like our identification down when we sign up? It’s as if our money isn’t green. Very disappointing and I’d really like something to be done about this.

If you made it to this point, thank you for reading!

Airbnb,AirBnB Cancelled Calgary Stampede Reservation Last Minute That Was Booked 6 Months In Advance...Host Claimed City of Calgary Told Them To Cancel Reservations Due To The Ongoing Water Limitations [Canada],"I had booked a studio apartment in the Mission/Cliff Bungalo neighbourhood for July 3rd to 15th back in January at a total cost of $1485 for the 12 nights. The host just cancelled the reservation less than a week before l'm meant to arrive. I'm flying from Toronto and the flights are non-refundable. I'm only interested in units where I have the whole unit to myself, not a room in a shared accomodation. Anything comparable still available on AirBnb, Vrbo, or a hotel is minimum 3X that price now. I can't afford to pay these higher prices

The host messaged me to say that the city had told them to cancel reservations due to the ongoing water limitiations, however I don't believe this is genuine as the repairs to the water pipe are well documented in the news and are on schedule to be repaired and back to normal by July 1st. l've asked for records of the communication the host has had with the city but I don't believe they exist and I haven't heard anything back from the host on this. I suspect that the host is going to relist the unit at a higher price, if not on AirBnb then on another platform.

AirBnb suggests I stay at an off-grid camping site or riverfront acerage 30 km's outside the city instead.

Airbnb,WWYD if weird “damage” found days after leaving?[US],"Some friends, ourselves and our dog all stayed at an AIRBNB 1-7th of July. Honestly, we were initially incredibly impressed by our hosts. They were incredibly accommodating, left us a bowl of dog treats and a bottle of wine! I was ready to leave them a glowing review…until halfway through our stay.

We were notified 3 days in that there would be people working on the roof starting that day. It was incredibly loud(we were all WFH) the roofers had tarp spread out where our doorway was and was throwing nails and roofing parts onto the tarp that was intended as a walkway for us and our dog. It was not what we had signed up for, but ok.

The noise was upsetting to our dog and she did dig on a corner of the carpet for a moment and pull up some fibers. We were aware of this and ready to cover the costs of repair for that damage. The day we left, we discussed it with the host, and during their inspection it was all they noted.

Three days after we left they “turned the lights on” and noticed a stain by the living room entry way. It was a minor discoloration that we noticed when we first arrived that we didn’t even think anything of. Our biggest regret now is not documenting it and time stamping it(lesson learned). They are claiming we caused it and trying to charge us for it.

Airbnb,"Young couple having lots of loud sex daily including in the bathroom which they leave extremely wet, steamy, and unsanitary with fan off, playing loud media and being loud late at night, blocking people in driveway, and leaving front door unlocked late at night. Call host or cope for two more days?","The couple is polite when you talk with them, but they do whatever they want even though you advised them in the host's absence about what seems to be expected in the shared home with current guests. They'll say they'll keep it down, but they don't and then laugh loudly if they hear that other guests are frustrated with being kept up late. 

One wants to be tolerant of others as is wise when staying in shared Airbnbs. It can be harder when the host is not present. This particular young long-distance couple has a cultural background that would forbid such behavior and demand abstinence before marriage and respect for one's elders. Airbnb can be a way to keep trysts secret and it sounds as though they use shared home stays to keep costs down so they can do this more frequently. One wants to be sympathetic with young lovers, but they are acting like they are staying in a frat house or private honeymoon suite. They've kept four people up three hours late tonight and some have to get up at 4:30 a.m. 

So, since were were home all day working or trying to and my family member would never call a host to ask for help, I'm it if anyone is going to complain, probably. The others might complain about the late night noise. 

Would you just ride it out for two more days till they leave or gently suggest the couple needs some helpful guidance or something else? I hate to be the complainer and we usually just tough out any situation we run across.

Airbnb,"Yeah, but what are the alternatives? Responding to negative articles about Airbnb. [USA]","It seems like every day my news feed, I see articles about how people are done with Airbnb. It's always the usual complaints, which I would agree are justified in many instances. Bad hosts, crazy cleaning fees, laundry list of chores, safety concerns, cameras, negative review reciprocity disincentivizing you from leaving actual feedback on a host, Airbnb affecting local real estate markets, over tourism, etc. You name it, I've read many articles about them. 

 So what is the alternative? Airbnb is a success story because it fills a demand. I travel regularly, globally, frequently with my family of four. My wife and I work online, we have two small children that have their own online schooling and activities. There's absolutely no way we could all Make this work in a hotel room. The idea of renting two hotel rooms is not good either because obviously I'm not going to leave my two small children in a room on their own. I can't really cook in a hotel room for my kids. Hotel Wi-Fi is generally not very reliable. Two rooms is not a replacement for a house/condo rental. 

VRBO in my experience is trash, I would say about 50% of my experiences on there have been problematic. Sure I've had a couple hiccups on Airbnb over the years, but I've been using it since 2011 and I think maybe I had a couple bad experiences.

We've traveled to over 70 countries. Many of them far off the beaten path of typical tourist hotspots. There's no way I could research, find, properly vet, and book from individual owners who might not even speak English, for rentals.

Airbnb,"Host cancelled last minute nearly ruining our vacation, AirBnB customer service effectively less than useless","Venting post on a topic that’s probably been brought up too many times to count. My wife and I booked an AirBnB rental in Grand Lake, CO 8 months ago for a family vacation (parents flying in from NY to stay with us in the rental) in June. Just over a week ago the host cancelled for no clear reason throwing the entire vacation into jeopardy after plane tickets were already purchased, dog care was procured, etc. Grand Lake, CO is one of the top in-state vacation destinations and it is impossible to find a comparable rental at the original price point just two months from the trip. 

Now the fun begins. I reach out to AirBnB first to try and find a solution. We could find comparable locations for around $1000 more OR we cancel the trip and eat the flight change charges. Neither was ideal as we’ve been looking forward to this trip since last August. Obviously time is of the essence and yet, it took 4 days before I received an initial response asking for more information despite me detailing everything in my initial support request. I respond and a day later get told the issue is being brought to an AirBnB community member. 6 days later I realize I’ve now been ghosted. Two days ago my wife left negative feedback which resulted in them finally connecting with her. After 48 hours of inane “support” where they did the same search for comparable locations that we did ending in the same results (nothing available at the originally price point) they offered us a $200 coupon to use on a future rental. This doesn’t even come close to the additional costs we’ve now had to field to salvage our trip. My wife and I rejected the coupon offer as we will 100% never utilize AirBnB for a vacation again and booked via a competitor for $800 more. Not only that, I’ll go out of my way to never stop recommending literally anyone who will listen to use competing services going forward.

I have been hosting on Airbnb for 4 years and been superhost for 3 straight years. It's hard to get superhost now. The requirements have increased, and the value of it has been diminished. This past year, I got a whopping $100 Airbnb travel credit on top of their sweet quarterly magazine. I was supposed to get married this year and the honeymoon was booked in Hawaii. We love the idea of staying at low key places, not resorts so of course we used Airbnb. $100 covered about less than one night in Hawaii but better than nothing. We worked our asses off to accommodate unruly guests this whole past year even sometimes waiving money to retain superhost standards. We had to cancel the trip of course due to Covid. When doing so the host I booked with understood, refunded no problem. Airbnb on the other hand, the $100 credit went back to them. They took it back and kept it. 3 problems here, this is entirely out of my control, Airbnb could easily offer the credit back but they won't, and 3 that $100 credit doesn't even go to the host. This is the most greedy bullshit rule I've ever seen. The host loses, the superhost loses, and the theoretical $100 coupon never existed pretty much.

Airbnb,AirBnb Has The Worst Customer Service Of Any Company In The Private Sector. It May Be Even Worse Than The Government,"Pre Pandemic I had a business managing multiple Air Bnb properties for home owners. Once Covid hit here that went away pretty quickly as people were not traveling to the city. I was OK with this as I was getting tired of dealing with the BS that Air Bnb was giving hosts over the previous couple of years.  I continued to manage one place as a favor for a friend and it has actually been very easy as the rentals have all been for 2 to 4 weeks or longer with no issues until now.

Believe it or not I had forgotten how archaic the Air Bnb Customer Service system is. 

We received a booking at the end of April for a two week reservation starting on Sunday May 2nd. The guest had requested an early check in which we were able to provide so I sent her entry instructions the morning of May 2nd to which she happily responded: ""*Thank you so much for accommodating this!*""

I didn't hear back from the guest on Sunday so on Monday morning I logged in to send a follow up message to see how everything was going so far. That is when I noticed the reservation had been canceled by the host at noon on Sunday. Now this was very confusing because I am the host and we were not contacted and in no way cancelled this reservation.

I called Air Bnb to ask why this reservation was cancelled and why we weren't contacted the previous day when the cancellation occurred. They seemed very confused and after a period of time they said the guest had complained about the listing and the reservation was cancelled. They had no answer as to why we, the hosts, had not been contacted. The CSR said they would expedited this matter to a review department and they would call us back.

Tuesday morning I hadn't received a call back so I called Air Bnb. Had the exact same conversation with the CSR that I had with the previous CSR- They couldn't do anything about it, but they would expedite the matter and we would receive a call back shortly.

Same exact thing on Wednesday Morning. Same exact thing on Friday. Same exact thing just now on Monday. It's like a pathetic Customer Service Version on Groundhog Day.

Ask to speak to a supervisor ""Not Possible.""  Ask to speak with the person this case has been expedited to ""Not Possible."" Ask to see any visual evidence as to why the reservation was cancelled ""Not Possible."" Ask to speak with the CSR that cancelled the reservation ""Not Possible.""

Meanwhile our calendar has been blocked for the past week as well as this week because it was a two week booking. Nobody can open those dates either. When asked why that is nobody has an answer. 

The best part is that on May 3rd we received a message asking us to review this guest. Then on May 6th we received an email letting us know that guest had cancelled the reservation - 3 days after we first called Air Bnb.

Air Bnb is a great company to work with as long as there are no problems that arise. Their customer service was very bad before Covid, apparently it has gotten much worse since. It really seems like they either don't have a clue as to how to serve hosts properly, OR, they really don't care about the hosts. I believe the latter is the truth.",177,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/n9ipj4/airbnb_has_the_worst_customer_service_of_any/,2021-05-10 23:02:56,Vrbo
Airbnb,"Neighbor Is Subleasing.. Do I report? [CA, USA]","So.. I've lived where I'm at for 4 years. It's a relatively quiet complex. I had 3 neighbors next door with the first one subleasing on AirBNB and my current neighbor subleasing. First one that I met got kicked out after his AirBNBs were hosting obnoxiously loud parties as it's against the lease. 

I can't figure it out if it's friends or family (or neither) as it always a large group that's always Asian. My doorcam catches them all the time at wee hours and my notifications flare up like crazy as we share the same walkway. They apparently have a camera and a keypad next to their door. I don't recognize anyone that comes in or out. On occasion I'd see luggage being strolled in. Today for the first time they had a dog barking that was startling my cats as we share a wall. 

Then there have been times that it's just quiet for like 2-3 weeks. They ""moved in"" at around the start of the year. I've never met them or had an opportunity to interact with them.

I have plenty of video and photos from my doorcam of them entering/exiting the unit. Would I be an asshole for reporting them? I haven't done or said anything yet but this is getting relatively annoying to deal with.

Airbnb,"TERRIBLE AirBNB experiences. 3 hosts cancelled in a row, what's going on?","So as the title says, I'm trying to use airbnb for the first time on my own as I'm travelling through Istanbul. 

First place I go to the apartment is disgusting, I submitted about 50 images proving this and airbnb cancelled it, had to book a last minute hotel. What an inconvenience. 

So then I book a 7 day stay in a condo, and I get a message from the host saying they made a mistake and cancels the listing. 

I book ANOTHER hotel. 

The next airbnb host does the same thing, says the place shouldn't be listend for Sept. Cancels. I only learn this when I get back to my hotel at midnight. 

Surely it couldn't happen again right?

The following day I book another airbnb for the next day. Host says there was a mistake and it shouldn't have been available. Has yet to cancel, even though I've asked them to, as has airbnb support. 

So yet again I have to book another last minute hotel.

Airbnb,"My account was permanently removed from airbnb, not sure why or what to do","This is my experience trying to visit a place for the first time with airbnb.

I just opened an account, found a cool place in my destination and booked it 1.5 months in advance. I wrote a small note to the host and she accepted my reservation.

After two days I got a message that my booking was cancelled, I tried to log in and got an ""account suspended"" message. I went through their authentication process (admittedly, I look a bit different from my ID, long/short hair & no messy beard do a lot) and today I got a mail saying my account was removed due to fraudulent activity.

I could imagine it has something to do with using a VPN at the time of booking, or maybe I missed a message from the host? I'm not sure... what can I do about this? and how can I find out what happened?

EDIT: ended up sending a [tweet](https://twitter.com/LevavFerberTas/status/1501456708543127553) please help me get attention to this :)

EDIT2: sent them the dm they requested, and now we wait...

EDIT3: just... see the rest of my tweets on this, its so fucked.
also, I was scrolling through the sub to see any similar issues and saw that there was an unreasonable amount of ""0"" votes on posts. This doesn't happen naturally on any sub, it means someone is actively going through all (negative) posts and downvoting them (I upvoted back ofc).
Still, this is a way to manipulate the reddit algorithm. if you read this, go through the last two days of posts and upvote them to combat this.

EDIT4: there hasn't been any development, and I've somewhat given up for now (I realized there are a lot of more important things I've got to spend my energy on, yes it sucks). If there'll be any interesting development, I'll update :)
Thank you all for taking the time to care about this, I enjoyed reading your comments even if I didn't end up responding ^^

Given your comments, it probably wasn't an issue with the VPN, so I honestly don't know what it was. Just bad luck with the algorithm I guess?

Airbnb,This is why I am leaving Airbnb as a host,"\[UPDATE\]

I took the advice of someone who messaged me privately and emailed the CEO and executive team of Airbnb.  Shortly after my case was resolved with Airbnb canceling the booking from the guest's end, which means the guest lost all their money.  

&#x200B;

However, the guests have refused to leave so I have a new problem that I anticipated.  I am less worried about this.  I know what my options are and most likely I'll have to take a deep breath and wait for them to leave.  I've learned from this experience that when you need REAL support from airbnb in a crisis, expect to go through hell.  The cost of this experience on my stress and lost productivity is not worth it.  From now on, I will USE Airbnb instead of being used by them.   Good luck out there.  

&#x200B;

For those of you that asked about other options than Airbnb here is what I recommend:  If you are serious about investing a lot of time in your rental you can use a site like [littlehotelier.com](https://littlehotelier.com) to set up your own Bed and Breakfast.  Full disclosure I don't have personal experience with them but have talked to others that left airbnb for their own private BnB listing and are fully booked.  The other advantage is that they have been able to sneak past the short-term rental restrictions in Los Angeles.  

&#x200B;

The other option is to connect with a local church or synagogue that has a big community and advertise to their community.  Find local FB groups and advertise through them.  Just remember you are going it alone so you will need to make sure you have all your safety nets, legal docs, and lease arranged.

Original Post

I bought my beautiful duplex 3 years ago.  In Los Angeles this is no small accomplishment.  My wife and I own 1 property and we love it.  We decided to use Airbnb to rent the upstairs while we live in the downstairs.  It has been mostly a great experience and Airbnb was great to work with through some of the small issues that came up from time to time. We earned dozens of great reviews. We become superhosts and we had a lot of confidence in Airbnb as a supportive platform that will be there when we need them.

Boy was I wrong!

After two years of renting we got our first guests from hell.  They paid for 4 and brought 7 which would have cost significantly more. The guests were well aware of our policy beforehand.  When we tried to speak with them nicely to resolve the issue, they threatened us.  Needless to say, I was livid and wanted these people out.  I thought Airbnb would be there to help us.  Again, boy was I wrong!

We have been out through customer support hell.  Here's the gist of it: -They make promises that sounds sincere, like "" we will call you back within an hour"" and they never ever call back. -They assign you a case manager and then 2 hours later their shift is over and someone new takes over that doesn't call you or have any clue what's going on. -They don't respond to their texts -They say they will take action in x amount of time and they don't -You have to call repeatedly and go over your story with the next agent who takes 30 minutes to finally understand the problem -When they finally understand and promise to resolve you hang up happy and then nothing happens.

This list goes on longer than I care to write.  I'm done with airbnb.  But since they've screwed me I'm going to screw then back.  Every guest that requests to book I'm going to take off platform until I get banned. In the meantime I'm going to use smaller but friendlier b&b sites.  I already get lots of off platform requests from an email list I'm part of.  I will share any info for other hosts who are sick of Airbnb.

I always thought people where whiners about Airbnb and now I know. I apologize to you all.  They lost a true fan.  I know I must be among thousands who are sick of them.  I look forward to doing my little part to sabotage them in whatever little way I can.",117,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/p3ieis/this_is_why_i_am_leaving_airbnb_as_a_host/,2021-08-13 07:07:26,Vrbo
Airbnb,Host Fucked by Airbnb,"I've been a host since 2014. Superhost the whole time. Over 100 5-star reviews. Fully booked for the upcoming tourist season yadda yadda yadda. A few days ago I can't log into my account - there's a message my account is suspended. No additional info. 

I call support. Wait wait wait, eventually get through. Get a support agent who sounds like she's standing outside during a hurricane. She can't tell me what's going on but says they'll check and get back to me.

I get an email a day later saying ""you've got a message from Airbnb support, click here to read it....""

I click, and it takes me back to my account...that I still can't access. So I can't see the message. Thanks, that's helpful. That's fine fine customer service.

A day later I get another email that says it was all a mistake and my account is restored. Here's a quote:

""While going through your appeal, we realized that your account was removed by mistake. We’re really sorry for any issues this may have caused. ""

So now my account is back...except all the bookings I had are gone and I have mad & confused messages from everyone who's booking got canceled.

Airbnb,Host declined adding additional guests to reservation,"My family is planning a trip to a small, touristy town for a spring event next month.  Knowing that rentals in the best area would be filling up, we started looking for rentals a month ago (\~2 months before the event).  It would be my family and one of my sibling's family for sure; my other sibling and her family was a maybe.

We found a house with capacity for all of us and booked the number of guests we knew were coming, expecting to be able to add guests up to the listed house capacity if needed.  A few days later, the reservation was confirmed, and we also learned my 2nd sibling and family were planning to come.  Simple enough -- we request to update the guest amount.

Our request to add these guests was declined quickly.  Weird.  Over a week later, the host messaged us, basically saying that the ""house can't handle that number of guests"" and ""to let them know if we needed to cancel"".  This is confusing, because the listing has that number as capacity.  Also, we carefully looked at the photos prior to booking to confirm the family units would comfortably split and fit in the provided sleeping areas.

We replied, saying as much, without reply from the host so far.  We're now a month closer to the event with even fewer options for booking additional locations.  Other than trying to change guests, nothing has been out of the ordinary on our end.  We've used airbnb and vrbo at least a half-dozen times with good results, so we're somewhat confused.

Doesn't the host set the limit for the number of guests?  If so, then why would they set a higher number on the listing than they will allow?  Has anyone found themselves in this situation?

&#x200B;

# Update:

Sorry for not getting back with the questions and whatnot.  It's been a busy day and we're getting things figured out now.

Reading some of the feedback from the hosts here makes some sense.  I understand hosts need to protect their properties and turn away unwanted problems whenever they can.

On the other hand, we were quick to request a change in guests as soon as our plans changed.  They declined our request immediately, which confused us (i.e. Was that a mistake?), so we explained the situation and asked for an explanation.  It took them *almost 2 weeks* to respond.  Had communication been more prompt on this reasoning, we would have still been within the 48-hour cancellation window.

Our current plans are to keep the reservation.  It's not fair to anyone to cancel at this point and I'm not particularly interested in figuring out the details of the refund policy.  Since we're frustrated with the current host and they don't seem to want the extra money anyway, we found a small nearby condo for one of our families.  It's not what we originally had in mind and we certainly would've made difference choices if we planned on multiple houses, but oh well.

Anyway, thanks for the insights everyone.  I'll definitely be more intentional about communicating intention next time I run into a situation like this.

Airbnb,"Plaid ""payment verification""","So today out of the blue while booking an AirBnB I was prompted to verify my payment information with Plaid. This was weird seeing as I had booked a couple others yesterday no problem. Matter of fact, I have booked almost 800 nights totaling close to $100k on this credit card over the last three years.

I figured whatever I would go through the process and clicked continue. I was prompted to log into my bank...where Plaid requested access to _all transactions for all accounts for all time_ (retirement accounts, mortgages, auto loans, credit cards, bank accounts, etc..._everything_) ...wtf?? There is no way I am going to grant this access to ""verify my payment method"". I denied the access request which canceled the verification process and prevented me from booking.

I decided to open a support request to see if I can get an exception figuring AirBnB wouldn't want to lose a customer over this. Well I was wrong, support claims the verification process is ""good for me"" and to ""make sure I don't get scammed"" which doesn't make any sense and offered no way around it other than to use PayPal which I am not interested in doing.

I ended up going over to Vrbo instead and found the exact same place for the same price and booked there. 

I am pretty sure this is just a way for them to make some money (or get a service for cheap/free) in exchange for farming customer transaction data. Even anonymized this data is quite valuable. If the service was legitimately just verifying the credit card limits/balances/etc it only would have requested access to this information. Since it requested unrestricted access to all of my accounts and data types it is clearly just trying to farm data.

Airbnb,Host requiring us to sign contract saying they can substitute another house?,"We found a beautiful house on the beach with a pool and plan to stay for 10 days.

After booking and the host accepting the booking, they now state we are required to sign a 13-page contract.  The contract is pretty basic except for two things:

* a paragraph that states they have the right to replace the property with a similar property
* they want our credit card details on the contract in case of damages, excessive cleaning and ""other applicable fees per the rental agreement herein"".

The part of the contract I'm most concerned with states:

`Accommodation Modification: You agree that the rental unit reserved by you is fungible with similar units. A ""similar unit"" is within a 5-mile radius, a similar distance from the beach, and available amenities, and sufficient occupancy to accommodate you and your guests. If you unit becomes unavailable other than because of your own acts or omissions or force majeure, the property manager may place you in a similar unit or refund all amounts paid by you for unused portions of your stay, at the property manager's sole discretion.`

Is this allowed per AirBnb's rules?  I'm nervous this is a bait and switch and we're going to get to the beach destination and be stuck.  Does anyone have any advice for me?

UPDATE: Thanks everyone.  I read the [link provided](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/465/if-a-host-asks-you-to-sign-a-contract) by a Redditor and read that the host is required to state the contract upfront.  I also went and read the listing a few more times.  I see no details in the listing as to the contract wording but in the ""Trip"">""Things to Know"", they dumped all the contract wording there, including this section about accommodation modification.  Also under ""Where you're staying"", they state ""By booking this house you agree to the following contractual terms...."" and list them again.

There were two other homes we were considering by other hosts and they are still available.  I'm just worried we won't get our money back on this one if we refuse to sign and be on the hook (it was several thousand dollars). Slightly stressful.  I wonder if AirBnB ever imagined/intended this could be such a stressful process.

ANOTHER UPDATE: It took us all morning, but we were able to get the booking cancelled and refunded in full. No help from the host.  It's taken us hours and stress to deal with this.  We are now scrambling to find accommodations at the last minute.  I'm also disheartened because I've read 100 other beach listings since last night and see MANY hosts put contract terms in the listing itself and don't pull this shady business of making you sign afterwards.  Also, as you all eluded, NO ONE mentions an ""accommodation modification"".  Such BS.

After it was cancelled, I was NOT able to leave a review which is disheartening as I feel the need to warn other renters.   I'm disclosing the listing and calling out the company below for other renters that might be googling in hopes that this shady company change their shitty practices.

**Host:** Southern Holiday Homes

**AirBnB listing:** [https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/54144145](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/54144145)

FINAL UPDATE: we are on our way to our new vacation destination.  It took many hours to find a new house but in the end we found a beautiful property on VRBO.  While looking for a second rental, I was quite frustrated and called Airbnb citing three violations with all 28 listings of Southern Holiday Homes that Airbnb let stay up on the site.  I said “all listings have the same 3 problems and you are letting them ruin other renters’ vacations as we speak.  How can you do this to your users?” They said they would check into it and offered us a $1000 credit.  Sadly, we found the prices and experience of VRBO so much better, we rented there.

Airbnb,Hosts properties are duplicates -is this a scam? [USA],"Hi, looking for opinions.

We’ve seen a property we like, hosts has 11 properties in total, all of which are new listings and none have any reviews. Host has been a host for 9 months.

Feeling suspicious I did a reverse image search on the property we like and two of her others. One of those others I found no matches, but the one we like and one of the others I found on multiple sites including air BnB, as well as match, vrbo etc.

 But listed with a similar but different names host (think ABC Stays & ABC Resorts level of similar), other host had lots of properties, super host, tonnes of reviews etc.



Other factors

* First host to second host had big price difference, first was cheaper
* Second host had rule about no stays over 28 days, first didn’t (relevant as we are looking for a  six week stay)
* First host replied to one message, but in broken English didn't answer any of our questions, second host hasn’t replied yet (with time zones I messaged second host about midnight their time & first a few hours earlier) but sent an auto response straight away with generic info.
* All bar one of the hosts properties are in the same area of the same state, the one I couldn't find in my reverse image searching is in some place in Canada I'd never heard of.
* The area we are looking at is in the USA, but we are not from there. Dreading the possibility of a long long journey only to have no accommodation.

I’m feeling pretty sure that first host is a scam… except I can’t work out what the scam would be. Surely we’d get to the destination, she can’t facilitate us getting in, we complain, get money back and she gets nothing? If they were going to try and get payment outside of air bnb surely she'd have sent a payment link at the first opportunity?

Airbnb,"Host is trying to persuade me to cancel my reservation for Christmas, possibly for wanting to charge a higher price, so I’m unsure of staying","This may be a long post, so I apologize beforehand. I’m also unsure if this is the right flair.

I booked a cabin in a nice snowy area for three days (a day before Christmas Eve-Christmas day). I booked it early in the year because I saw it was cheap, can accommodate for up to 15 people (important detail), had a pool table, hot tub, etc. It came to $2000 total. They accepted my request and I thought that was the end of it.

However, I received a call from an unknown number and answered it. The man claimed to be my host and said that the city is making him change his max occupancy to 10 people instead of 15. He told me that I would have to cancel if I wanted to bring 15 people. I told him I would discuss it with my family and call him back. I called him back telling him that 10 people max is fine since we were only planning for 12 people total so we just didn’t invite two of them. He seemed surprised that I wanted to keep the reservation. He kept telling me “you cannot sneak other people in”. I told him that I wasn’t and that I genuinely thought the 10 person limit was acceptable. He seemed agitated and said he would offer me a full refund if I cancel now. I told him that I didn’t want to and the cancellation policy says I’ll only get half of my money back anyway. He paused and said he would call me back later. 

I became concerned after the phone call because I needed to verify his identity and our conversation wasn’t through the app. I called Air BnB and told them how the conversation went. They said they would call back after talking to him. When they called back, they gave details that didn’t seem to line up with what was said. Apparently, he claimed that he was fine with me staying and bringing 15 people since that was what was stated in the listing. When the customer service agent asked about him offering a full refund, he backpedaled and said he would rather for me to stay and isn’t changing the refund policy. Customer service made it seem like the host was doing ME a favor by keeping my reservation. At the end of the call, the customer service agent said that the host may call and ask for more money for the stay. I was confused and asked why since we are following the contract of the stay and I already paid in full ahead of time. They said I didn’t need to, it’s only if I wanted to (like why would I want to pay more??). 

The whole even above was around 2-3 months ago. Yesterday, I messaged him through the app asking if I can switch the days from Friday-Monday to Saturday-Tuesday instead. He said he would be willing to for $1900 per day. I decided against it because it’s pretty much the cost of the entire stay we already have. I didn’t mention cancelling but he brought up that he was willing to give me a full refund if I wanted to cancel. I declined once again and that was the end of the conversation. 

I want to stay at the air bnb but now I’m nervous about staying because I don’t know if he’ll find some way to make our stay uncomfortable or leave a bad review. I already thought it was sketchy that he called me instead of messaging me on the app and telling the agent a different story. I also noticed he changed the prices from $500 a night to $1900 a night around the days of my stay.

TLDR: Air Bnb host called wanting to change the conditions of my stay as agreed on the contract and wants me to cancel potentially to charge more but told customer service otherwise when I called them to confirm his information",59,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/ya3huj/host_is_trying_to_persuade_me_to_cancel_my/,2022-10-21 20:14:52,Vrbo
Airbnb,If your host cancels last minute Airbnb will hang you out to dry,"I'm traveling to Chicago for a music festival this week and as any responsible traveler would I booked an Airbnb to stay in months ago. On Friday I get an email that my Airbnb was cancelled. Now, days out, most places are booked and 4x as expensive. Airbnb's customer service sent me a half dozen listings miles outside the city suggesting I book there instead. After I explained I won't have a car and am dependent on public transit and would need to stay closer to downtown like I had booked, they've completely ghosted me and haven't responded to me in over 48 hours.                       

That ""guest commitment promise"" to relocate you in a place of equal and greater value if something goes wrong? Only applies if you arrive at the location and it isn't up to snuff. If a host cancels on you last minute you're hung out to dry. I did some research this weekend and the only real penalty for a host cancelling less than a week from the booking date is a $100 penalty paid to airbnb. Apparently it's common for hosts to cancel reservations last minute if they think they can make more relisting it. And Airbnb does nothing to discourage this. The host in question has a dozen properties listed on Airbnb.                               

&#x200B;

And to add insult to injury in this clown show, Airbnb only issued me a partial refund. As if i was the one that cancelled last minute.

Airbnb,"Got my account shut down because background check found AN EXPUNGED, NONCONVICTION ARREST FROM WHEN I WAS 18 after 5+ years of 5star acct used in 20+ countries. Found a lawyer suing reporting agency for similar stories!","Hello,

I was an ACTIVE Airbnb user. In fact a large part of my plans for 2020 as I finished college and made some money from a new jobs as well as some very fortunate investing wins involved planning to buy houses/apartments to begin making money off as an AirBnb host as so many people I know do this and own homes for free, basically get PAID to own homes.

I've used Airbnb since at least 2016. I used it for some trips within the US. Then in 2017 I backpacked Europe with my girlfriend for 7 months and used Airbnb a TON, cumulatively probably 2-3 months in Airbnbs all over Europe when we were not staying in hostels and wanted privacy.

From late 2017-2019 I went to Japan, Puerto Rico 3 times, Europe 2 more times, England 4 times, to Colorado, Orlando, Gainesville, Tallahassee, Virginia, West Virginia, New Orleans, New York, the Florida keys, Jamaica, Toronto, British Colombia, Anaheim California, Los Angeles, Cleveland Ohio, Miami Ohio, and probably a few other places for both work and pleasure and used Airbnb for almost EVERY SINGLE TRIP

Let this sink in, I probably have spent about 6-7 cumulative months in Airbnbs over the period from 2016-2020. I even went to Puerto Rico in January of 2020 and stayed in the same Airbnb I always stayed in!

Then in February 2020 I went to go to London for a work convention I had been to in 2018 and 2019. My friends and I had stayed in the same apartment both times as it was about $100 cheaper in USD than in British pounds (they were UK based). We went to rent the same one again, but after paying the first half I was told my account had been shutdown

Airbnb had a background check run on me and shut down my account with no recourse. I was arrested in 2012 when I was 18, more than 8 years before.
I was trying to get into my own home but had left my key and my family was not home. I was checking the backyard windows and police showed up, a neighbor likely called them but they're station is literally at the end of my block so they were there instantly. I showed them my ID and that this was my house, but they yanked me over my wall anyway and handcuffed me.

 My grandmother arrived home in the time I was handcuffed, a crying, dark brown latino boy who had JUST turned 18 and was terrified of why he was being told he was a criminal and screamed at the police to let me go, that they were racist, that I was her grandson and this was my house, and I stood up, managed to slip out of my handcuffs and tried to run back into my backyard. 

The police tazered and attacked me and charged me with every fucking crime you can imagine. They charged me with burglary (of my own home), escape (a felony for PRISONERS WHO ESCAPE CUSTODY, not someone who runs from the police when not under arrest), resisting officer with and without violence and even tried to charge me with domestic violence against my grandmother so that a judge couldn't let me out to go to my house where she lived until 2 weeks of sitting in jail had passed and my charges were declared No Action by the court, they were not even going to charge me because of how ridiculous the accusations were.

Except the escape and resisting officer without violence.

I was 18 and wanted to go to trial, but my lawyer made me take a plea of a pre-trial diversion program. 

Anyway, it took until 2016 for everything to end and what ended up happening was because I didn't commit escape and should not have been charged everything finally ended up getting completely dismissed.

We got the arrest EXPUNGED ENTIRELY, so it should not have appeared on any background checks, in mid-2017.

So, when it came up in 2020 I was fucking devastated and had what I thought was no recourse, until it came up on another background check for a job (they ended up giving me the job after I explained the situation so thats good!) I started looking into laws and wrote out what happened on the website of a random lawyer while in an angry fit of using the internet

I thought I was just fucked by life and had no recourse because of this evil thing that happened to me when I was newly 18, I didn't think I would have my life so fucked up by it almost a full decade of no arrests later! I also thought nothing would come of typing in that lawyers contect us page, but LOW AND BEHOLD

A few days later I got a call from a number in Minnesota. Thinking it was a scam call, I answered ready to waste their time in the way youtubers I like to watch do, but IT WAS THE LAW FIRM!

They told me that while you cannot sue AirBnB for ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD that they use a 3rd party company for credit reports and background checks and that you CAN sue them for reporting wrong information especially when it costs you damages!

So, essentially now a few weeks have gone by and a formal lawsuit has been started. It didn't cost me any money but they are suing for damages and pain and suffering and a bunch of other legal mumbo jumbo and for having an illegal record of an expunged arrest that they should not have. We are also suing the other reporting agency that told my job about the expunged arrest regardless of the fact that I got the job!

So, I have read that this has happened to other people. I read about a man who was a 5 star super host that had started Airbnb ing out part of his house and had moved up to owning FIVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES in his city, being 5 star rated and then suddenly in 2019 or 2020 they did the same background check and found AN EXPUNGED ARREST FROM 28 YEARS BEFORE and shutdown his account with no recourse! If anyone should sue, that guy absolutely should! There are even EMPLOYEES OF AIRBNB who cannot use AirBnB because of old arrests despite being able to be hired by the company because of laws regarding background checks and what they can and can't report and what certain states do and don't allow employers and potential renters and housing places to make decisions based upon criminal history. 

Anyway, I am wondering if anyone else has had this issue, as I have seen old posts of this happening to people but they are too old to leave new comments on! You should know that you can sue the 3rd party company.

I am also wondering if anyone had AirBnB reinstate their accounts after their reports were done through ANY MEANS AT ALL, because they are essentially a global monopoly, VRBO is very small and hotels are much more expensive and often require deposits or credit cards, which black and latino people like myself are statistically less likely to have. 

Also because of the EEOC it is illegal to have blanket policies regarding employment and housing where anyone with any arrest at all, even dismissed arrests, would be denied housing or employment as black and Hispanic people, like myself, are more likely to have been arrested statistically than white people and thus such policies would be racially or ethnically discriminatory.

So, basically, if anyone is in a similar situation here are some things I learned from my lawyer:


1. It is illegal to report an arrest older than 7 years. 

For non-conviction arrests this is 7 years from the date of the arrest.
For conviction arrests this is 7 years from the completion of your sentence, so the day your case was closed.

2. If you have sealed or expunged your record and it shows up on a background check, as AirBnb's background check company seems to so often do, you have a straight up FCRA lawsuit on your hands!

3. Any errors on background checks can be reported within TWO YEARS of the background check being obtained, and the reporting agency has a small window of time within which it must respond to or address your report to them. However, as this is a long period of time, any damages (such as not being able to get an AirBnb EVER AGAIN and having to pay for more expensive or further away lodging for business trips or even on vacations) can be claimed in court that happen in that intermediary period as a result of decisions made based on the incorrect background check.

Please let me know if anything like this has happened to you! Let's talk, and maybe someone else here will be able to have their life fixed and be able to use this monopolistic service again, although why you would want to after being treated in such a disgusting and discriminatory way is beyond me. But you could also have a beautiful FCRA lawsuit on your hands that could get your background check corrected and a nice chunk of change from evil, lying, corrupt, disgusting Credit Reporting Agencies that are just out to ruin the lives of the 25% of people that have at least been arrested once in the US!",113,88,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/l4c9ig/got_my_account_shut_down_because_background_check/,2021-01-25 01:02:31,Vrbo
Airbnb,AirBnB keeps canceling my booking and banning me. What am I doing wrong? [CA],"I've booked with AirBnB twice over the last two years at different locations. We had excellent stays, gave and were given good reviews with no negative feedback. I booked a 3 day weekend at a new location 2 months ago and invited all 10+ guests. I got banned the next day and after contacting support they found it to be an error or odd, anyways. They were very kind and removed the ban for me so I could rebook. Everything was going great until a few weeks ago when suddenly my booking was canceled and my account was banned from making any new bookings - with zero information on why that happened.

Got on the phone with support. They said it was to ""ensure my safety"" and that it was normal protocol (hmm, never happened to anyone I know before and the last time they just removed it but ok you're the support guy). Wait 10 days, then book again and everything will be fine. I let my host know the situation and thankfully they agreed to hold the dates for me while I waited out the ban. 

10 days later, I was granted access and booked again. Everything went through, but less than an hour after, my account was banned again with the reservation canceled. Got on the phone with support, third time for those keeping score. They promised to escalate it and send me an email confirmation later that day followed by a phone call from a representative. That didn't happen.

What am I doing wrong? What am I supposed to do here? It's pretty embarrassing going back to the host for the third time asking them to hold the dates. How can they not suspect something's up if I keep getting canceled? And why do I have to keep phoning back and getting jerked around when this should have been fixed weeks ago? I'm stressed out of my mind, I've got all these guests coming including family from out of province with their newborn child in a week.. and airbnb just keeping saying ""we'll fix it"". But they're not fixing it.

Btw not crapping on AirBnB but this is a seriously bad situation and now we're like a week out from the event with no resolution in sight. Advice?",4,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1bw4w2y/airbnb_keeps_canceling_my_booking_and_banning_me/,2024-04-05 01:08:11,Vrbo
Airbnb,How are they allowed to do this? I’ve tried to book and they’re “unavailable” after booking. [usa],"So my classmates and I are in a study abroad course going to Europe for 7 weeks. We are trying to rent in a foreign country, so we were told VRBO, Airbnb, etc would be best because they’re reliable. At this point, we’ve “booked” three different airbnbs, all listed as available, just to be messaged a week later and told the dates aren’t actually available and to cancel our requests. We haven’t gotten to the point of payment yet, so I’m sure it could’ve been worse, but how are so many people allowed to list the houses when they aren’t actually available? Why isn’t there a better system for reporting when this happens so the hosts get marks as being unreliable? I don’t use Airbnb often so maybe I’m missing something.

Edit: I have had multiple responses so let me clear some things up: 
We have positive reviews as a traveler on Airbnb, only one review but it’s a good one from traveling abroad. The places we have attempted to rent are for students only, so the whole “college kids are a mess” thing I feel doesn’t apply when they’re only looking for students? And lastly, hotels are EXPENSIVEEEEEE I am booking with two other people and there is no way that we could afford a hotel room with three beds for 7 weeks. The cost of an Airbnb for that length is about $4000 and the cost of a hotel is about $9800 and that’s at a CHEAP hotel in Europe (~200 a night). Please stop suggesting this as it literally isn’t an option for us unfortunately!",6,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/19em7ir/how_are_they_allowed_to_do_this_ive_tried_to_book/,2024-01-24 17:15:47,Vrbo
Airbnb,Airbnb terminated my 4 year Superhost (4.96 rating) account and they won't tell us why!,"  

I have been a superhost for 4 years and have a 4.96 rating with over 200 reviews (if you are a host you know how difficult that is) and Airbnb cancelled all our reservations and hid our listing. We run our airbnbs as a family business and we take a lot of pride with our listings. We have two 5 bedroom listings so we have given airbnb A LOT of service fees.

This happened so suddenly that our guest who was 30 minutes from checking in had their reservation cancelled. We had NO email explaining why this happened. Not even a generic email to say there was an investigation or we did something wrong. We even had guests who planned their wedding in at our cancelled a week before they checked in.

When we called Airbnb their customer support couldn't tell us what or why this happened. All they said was they will escalate the situation and a manager will call us later in the day. They never reached out so we called again and all they said was there was 2 open cases for us in the trust and safety department. The customer service rep couldn't do anything on their end so here we are waiting for Airbnb.

I find it INSANE that they cancelled all our reservations and suspended our account without concluding an investigation or giving us the courtesy of calling us to explain the situation. If we did something wrong then fine, let us know what we did wrong and reprimand us.

Times are tough due to covid and we lost 70% of our revenue and now the bookings we managed to scrape up are cancelled.

Airbnb,F*ck AirBnB! They've incorrectly identified me as person with criminal charges and cancelled all my reservations. One for this weekend!,"**Update** 

AirBnB has unblocked my account. Luckily someone helped expedite the process (I'll keep their username anonymous so they're not bombarded with messages). Without their help I wonder how long this will have taken. 

Even with their help, all my reservations are cancelled. I might try and follow up to see what, if anything, AirBnB will offer to make things right. 

Here is the email I just received: 

Thanks for getting in touch with us. After reviewing your account, it appears it was suspended in error. We’ve re-activated it so everything should be in working order and apologize for any confusion.

**Update #2**

I'm currently working with their customer support. For the two bookings they're offering me $200 coupons. For one reservation that might be ok, though I'm spending all day working on this so I should probably take that into consideration, but for the second booking that will not fly. 

For that booking, the closest option that is similar to my original booking is over twice the cost and double the distance from my event. So if I took their $200 coupon, I would pay more for a place that is farther away. 

I have spent all day trying to work with them but instead of just doing what is fair they're trying to save a couple of bucks, which in the scope of things, shouldn't be that much of a hardship. Had this not happened I would have packed my bags a couple of days from now and would not have to worry about any of this. 

I've asked for double the amount. 

In summary, a multi-billion dollar company is fighting me for $300 for a problem they created to begin with... jfc

**Final Update**

After much consternation, they gave me two $400 coupons. I started this journey at 6:30 am and it's over and done with at 4:00 pm (minus me rebooking the second reservation they cancelled but I'm too tired to do that today). 

In conclusion - I'm paying about the same for the first booking but it is double the distance of the original. I have not rebooked the second but I may save some money there. I definitely feel like I'm missing something for the time and energy I lost today but I'll take it at this point. 

I hope this doesn't happen to anyone else!

**Original Post**

To say I'm seething is putting it lightly. I woke up to several email messages telling me about all of my cancelled reservations. 

Apparently there is some system that checks if anyone has criminal charges against them and automatically cancels everything and locks down their account. No warning. 

How do they know you have criminal charges? Because they match your first name, last name, and date of birth. Want me to tell you how easy it is to confuse two or more people based on only that criteria in all of the US... very easy. I am astounded that such harsh actions are taken on such a simple match. Does it matter this person is in another state? No. Do they want to ask for additional clarifying information first? No.

AirBnB said who needs more info. Let's fuck this person over and they can dispute it after the fact but in the meantime lets ruin all of their plans. How easy would it be to prove I'm not this other person, very easy and it wouldn't take much effort.

Airbnb,Honest Airbnb Review of Recent Weekend Stay [USA],"Due to flight delays we got to our Airbnb late Friday night. A 4x4 or AWD was critical to navigate the roads to the cabin but not emphasized enough. The roads had swells and got slick with mud. Navigating them in the dark was tricky and our party got lost even when using Airbnb’s map. A neighbor had to tell us how to find the place. We noticed a leak in the basement wetting the carpet when we arrived. We contacted the owner about the leak the next morning. The next day we noticed the leak was considerably bigger. Than, walking around the cabin we noticed there was no usable firepit with benches, a usable gazebo, or a usable zipline & pond like advertised in the Airbnb photos. A leak in the basement made the family room unusable, which was the only room in the house for a large group of people to relax in. There was a leak under the kitchen sink making a puddle to the floor. Foul odors were coming from 2 of the rooms like something had died, grime covered the kitchen table, and dirt plugged up air filters downstairs to the point they weren’t working properly.

The owner got back to us and said he was calling their handyman. The handyman showed up Monday, 2 days later. We had family who flew in from Texas for the weekend and we did not get what we paid for. The house was not in a safe condition. The place seemed to be in a state of disrepair and neglect. The photos on Airbnb’s website for this property should either be updated or removed due to inaccuracy. We would have left the next day, but the owners were so slow getting back to us with a solution and we had so little time with our family that we just made do and kept the kids out of the basement. We requested an $800 refund. Not quite half of the cost because we only got about half of the service. Airbnb told us they were only mediators and couldn’t offer more than $250 discount from the buyer or $375 from Airbnb itself. Since we are able to back up all these issues with photos I told Airbnb Customer Service to have a Supervisor call me because I wanted the full amount requested. The Airbnb rep on the phone said he was only authorized to offer us $375. I was told a supervisor would call yesterday, then again today. It is now 6:30pm where I am and no call. My next step is to take it up with my credit card company to see if I have any recourse. I will only use Vrbo from now on.",1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1erokb9/honest_airbnb_review_of_recent_weekend_stay_usa/,2024-08-14 01:08:50,Vrbo
Airbnb,"Airbnb is falsely advertising prices, and they seem to be ok with it.","I've been browsing Airbnb, and I noticed that some homes will change their price when you enter dates, a quick google turns up [this page](https://www.airbnb.co.uk/help/article/1369/why-did-the-price-of-my-reservation-change-after-i-selected-dates) which seems reasonable. The price of an apartment changes based on the time that you book it - no problem.

But then this begs the secondary question, what times can you book in order to get the price quoted on the airbnb site? I searched around for a while trying to find the answer, I played with the date picker for a while. No dice, so I sent a message to Airbnb asking about it. I linked an example property (which I shall now refer to as example property) where the listing price was £31, but any attempt to book it would raise the price to between £50-£100.

Amusingly - they responded with a phone call. I had a chat with the guy from airbnb, listened while he practically recited that page word for word. I explained to him that I understood that the price changes based on time/demand and that's perfectly reasonable, but that's not the question I'm asking, and that I'm asking under what criteria can I book example property for the advertised £31 a night, I don't mind what dates, I don't mind number of people.

He said that he understood, and just reiterated that this was up to the host based on their custom pricing, he kept on trying to direct me to contact the host for a ""special offer"", or look at other properties in the area that were cheaper. After going round in circles for a while, he finally agreed he'd go and talk to his colleagues about the issue and call me back in 15 minutes

During the first call I set up some call recording, so I caught the end of the first call and the whole of the 2nd one. I had a feeling this was going to get amusing, and sure enough it did. He spent ages trying to explain to me that it was the hosts ""custom pricing"", get me to book other properties, asking me to contact the host for a special offer, etc etc. With me continually saying ""No, I want to book example property for £31 a night as its advertised, I don't care when, I don't care what number of guests, I want to know the criteria that I can book this for £31 a night""

He finally caved, and confirmed to me that there was absolutely no way for me to book the property at £31 a night, no combination of dates, number of guests, or any other setting would allow me to book the property at the advertised price.

Surprising to have them just blatantly admit to false advertising, but there you go.

Edit: To be clear since a bunch of people are commenting about this. Airbnb confirmed to me on the phone that there is no combination of dates, guests, or any other criteria that would allow me to book the example apartment for the price listed. I am fully aware that hotels, and airbnbs change the prices on different dates and I have no problem with this practice. I have a problem with there literally being no way to book the apartment for the price that is advertised.",43,152,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/akoptt/airbnb_is_falsely_advertising_prices_and_they/,2019-01-28 15:53:33,Vrbo
Airbnb,Co-hostif multiple properties- need advice!! [USA],"United States

Looking for advice for streamlining my business. I currently own 2 rentals, and cohost for 6 others. I have a separate Turno account for each owner so the payment goes directly from the owner to the cleaners. I would need a property managment license if I were to collect their booking payments then disperse them

I signed up for Lodgify hoping it could help streamline and put everything in one place between all the airbnb accounts, 3 vrbo accounts, several Turno accounts, and pricelabs. However, I'm now finding it will only connect the airbnb accounts I OWN, not co-host, and would have to connect each owners account individually using their logins.

Does anyone have a similar setup and have any advice on how to streamline everything to be in one place?! My head is spinning trying to figure it all out. Thank you.

Oh, and unless I allow lodgify/stripe to process V*bo payments, only calendars will be connected and nothing else 🤯",1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1egvbzp/cohostif_multiple_properties_need_advice_usa/,2024-07-31 19:00:53,Vrbo

I know some/many people like seeing an ""out the door"" price rather than a nightly rate, but maybe it's my old school way of searching, I prefer to view nightly rates as a quick way to narrow down places. Having the toggle for those who prefer to search one way vs the other seems simple enough, so I wonder why they (seemingly) got rid of it.

I'm not here to debate which way is ""better"", just wondering if I'm just not seeing it or if they removed it. I didn't find any info online about a change to this effect.

Airbnb,Airbnb letting host scam renters,"I was unfortunately scammed out of $1400 when I rented a home with a pool. Only to discover at check in that the pool was not the same pool that was advertised on Airbnb. The pool on Airbnb was crystal clear and clean, the pool I got was disgustingly dirty, filled with algae and unsafe to swim in. The host refused to come clean it, refused to give me a partial refund and Airbnb refuse to do anything about it. After I checked out I see a review from a previous guest that had the same complaint as me. How can Airbnb continue to let this host falsely advertise a clean accessible pool when they know for a fact that the pool is not clean and does not look like the pictures that’s on their website?

Airbnb,Read before you confirm your stay. [USA] east coast,"Just ranting,

I was so happy and looking forward to this airBnB mini vacation until the day before. I decided to look at all the information. I come to find out that the host is not only there but also has a roommate. It’s the most awkward situation I have ever been in. 

I feel like I can’t be myself and just doing something normal like making breakfast would be so strange. I’ve stayed at airBnBs before, but this is the first time this has ever happened to me. I instantly regret this and wish I looked at all the information prior to reserving. I just saw how cheap it was per night. 

So, goes to show read everything before reserving. 

Nothing again the host. He seems like I good and respectful guy. ",0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1cjp29u/read_before_you_confirm_your_stay_usa_east_coast/,2024-05-04 01:48:34,Vrbo
Airbnb,Nervous about reservation being cancelled due to special event [USA/CA],"Hey y’all! 

In a weird situation here, i’m headed to Montreal Canada next summer for F1. 

As expected, most places are listed at double or triple what they are other weekends of the year. I booked a VRBO a few weeks back, and my reservation was cancelled a day or two after, I reached out to the host and she told me they charged more that weekend and hadn’t updated the listing. 

I found a place on AirBnB that is an amazing deal, and I booked it as soon as it became available to book (a year in advance to the date) but now i’m nervous that the host will pull the same fast one the other people did. 

My res is confirmed, and I got the standard thanks for booking blah blah message from the host. 

Should I reach out to them to make sure i’m good, should i not say anything and treat it as BAU?

Airbnb,Host Wants Us to Cancel Even Though They Lied & Kicked Us Out...Are We Wrong Here? Do We Deserve a Full Refund?,"Hello Everyone, this is a long and nuanced one.  We're just looking for advice and help.  We feel like our hosts are completely insane and Airbnb support is willfully negligent but we are looking for third parties to verify or refute.

**Background**

My girlfriend and I booked a long-term stay (\~2.5 months) back in early March for mid-June through early-September.  The place said it was pet-friendly, although the house rules asked for a ""*well-behaved and friendly dog (we do not allow any dog who is aggressive to either people or other animals in anyway, including lunging, loud barking or growling) who is trained to follow the rules below is allowed with an additional pet fee of $50. Payment of this fee will be requested separately through air b and b. Pets are not permitted on the furniture or beds and guest agrees to pay an additional cleaning and/or repair fees associated with failure to comply. If your pet is not able to be in the in the space quietly and comfortably when you are away (i.e. minimal barking or jumping up on the furniture) you will either need to take them with you at all times, or we unfortunately cannot accommodate you. If your dog is kennel trained, we can loan you a kennel during your stay.*""  It said any violation of this would allow the hosts to kick us out and charge us $300.  We did not have our puppy at the time of booking, we picked up a new puppy just before arriving to the Airbnb.  However, it is a Bernedoodle (smart, highly-trainable breed) and we paid to get it trained for a month from age 2 months to age 3 months before we picked her up.  We figured that with her training and our ability to adapt that we would be able to have a ""well-behaved"" dog who fits the description.  We told the hosts we were bringing a dog, and they were cool with that.  We did not specify ""puppy"" but also did not intentionally withhold that.  We thought ""pet-friendly"" meant as such.

It is also worth mentioning that we are fully nomadic, in other words we live at long-term Airbnbs and have been doing so without issue for the past 13 months.  We have a car jam-packed with our stuff and a rooftop bag.  Moving from one location to another is a lot of work.

**Timeline of Events:**

1. **Day 1:** we check in late at night, do not see hosts.
2. **Day 2:** we meet the husband host (hereby known as Husband Host).  He meets our puppy and asks her age.  We tell him she's 3 months old.  He seems fine with it.  The wife host (hereby known as Wife Host) is away for the week.
3. **Days 2-7:** we unpack everything and set up our lives.  It's a ton of work.  We join a local gym.  We find out they don't have air conditioning as advertised but instead they have temperature-controlled floors that are fairly ineffective.  Temperature never gets below 70 and is usually at 73-75 which is uncomfortable for us and difficult to sleep in.
4. **Day 8:** Wife Host and Husband Host come by our place and tell us that they have a ""no puppy"" rule and that they took a lot of time to write up their description and that we should have let them know we were bringing a puppy, and that they want us to leave, but that they'll let us stay a little while to find new accommodations.  They are very concerned for their ""very expensive floors and furniture.""  We tell them that a week in she has been entirely non-destructive to furniture or floors, and that the only issue is that she is peeing on the rugs.  She was housebroken by her trainer on indoor pee-pads so it ended up taking her a week to adjust to a new environment and to outdoor potty time.  We ask is there anything we can do to mitigate their concerns, including payment for any damages.  They say it's not about money and that they want us to leave and that's the only option.  We are both confused because we don't remember seeing anything about a no puppy rule, but maybe we missed it, so we say that we'll talk about it and let them know what we're going to do next.  We check the listing and it turns out there is a ""no puppy"" rule, not in the house rules but in the house description space which is about 4 pages long and this text is toward the bottom.  We are mildly suspicious that they made up this rule and put it on the listing after realizing we brought a puppy, but in the meantime we assume responsibility.  We start looking on Airbnb and VRBO for alternative options for long-term stays in the area that are somewhat immediately available, but there is nothing remotely within our price range, and everything is booked for a few weeks out at the minimum anyway.  We call Airbnb immediately and explain the situation.  We tell them that we feel a bit left out to dry...kicked out a week into a 2.5 month stay after we drove across the country with all of our stuff to get there, and ask them if they can help us find/afford new accommodations.  Airbnb tells us that they will try to help and they create a case.
5. **Days 8-11:** we keep calling and messaging Airbnb and get almost no response.  Everyone on the phone says they can't connect us to the right person handling our case.  On Day 10 we find out that no one has been assigned to our case yet, still.  Seems like it got sent to the wrong department or something.  On Day 10-11 we write up a letter to the hosts and my girlfriend stays up all night baking them cookies.  The letter does the following 1) apologizes for us misreading their rules and the resulting discomfort we caused, 2) begs them to let us stay with a list of potential issues with a puppy and how we feel we can mitigate them, and again offering financial compensation, and 3) we say that ultimately we do not want to cause them any trouble so if the answer is still no then we respect that and will get out of their way ASAP and no hard feelings.  No response.  On Day 11 we find out that the original listing when we booked said nothing about puppies, age limits, or housebroken rules.  Now we're pissed off and REALLY need Airbnb to help us out, whether by pushing back on the host or by finding us a new place to stay.
6. **Day 12:** The host sends us a copy of a message they sent to Airbnb: ""*we specify that we only friendly, well-behaved dogs over the age of 2 (no puppies or older dogs who do not have good bladder control)- it is ridiculous that they assumed that they could buy a new puppy and train it in our home. It is completely unacceptable that they think it is ok to bring an animal who will poop and pee in the house, potentially chew on and damage the furniture). Our dog just turned 1 year old so we just finished training a dog and went to a lot of effort to protect the floors and furniture for the first year. we've had many dogs and have had them professionally trained as well as trained them ourselves and every dog has accidents and ruins thing no matter how carefully you watch them. When we confronted them about the puppy, who is 12 weeks old, they claimed that they had it professionally trained (that is just ludicrous it routinely takes at least 16-20 weeks to fully house train a dog, and even then they will still have frequent accidents for several months after). we asked them if they had ever had a puppy before and they said as children (i.e. their parents trained them) and assured me that she was cleaning up after the dog when it has accidents. THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT, WE DO NOT WANT A DOG IN OUR HOME THAT WE ARE NOT DIRECTLY SUPERVISING HAVING ACCIDENTS.Even if this was not in direct violation of our rules, no normal, polite and considerate person would ever take a new puppy into someone else's home without permission and expect that they would be ok with the dog having accidents in their home. We have a very nice, expensive home with concrete floors and lots of custom made furniture. It is completely unacceptable that air b and b is dragging their feet in addressing this situation. I will only assume that you are willing through your insurance policy to pay the 10's of 1000's of dollars it will cost to have the floor refinished to remove all trace of urine odor. we did not even allow our own puppy in that space until she was potty trained, i cannot believe we are being forced to endure an inconsiderate, sneaky guest who claims that they did not know the rules and now expect that is their problem that they cannot find another spot to stay that will allow them to have a new puppy (any normal person who cares for their home would not allow this, so i'm not surprised that they are having a hard time finding another place.*""  We don't understand what happened or why the hosts would accuse us of deceit, sneakiness, or why they would react negatively to our letter at all.  In a later direct conversation Wife Host tells us that after reading our letter they were convinced we would not leave, even though our letter explicitly states that we will and ""no hard feelings.""  In retrospect, it is our belief that from the moment they learned we brought a puppy that they thought that we willfully deceived them, and as a result everything that followed they chose to believe nothing that we said.  The hosts tell us they want us out by **Day 15**, and we say that we want to leave ASAP but we don't have anywhere to go and that we want to work this through Airbnb and are waiting for them to get back to us.  We are calling Airbnb like crazy people multiple times a day and messaging nonstop, to no avail.  We're scared to talk directly with the hosts again.
7. **Day 13:** The hosts threatens legal action, and we go to a hotel.
8. **Day 14:** We ask our host to cancel the reservation.  The host refuses and says we must cancel because she doesn't want us having our full refund and that we should pay for the time we stayed.  We think that because we were kicked out for violating rules that didn't exist that we deserve a full refund, not to mention the lying, accusations, and threats we received.  They violated the [Terms of Service](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2908/terms-of-service) where it says hosts should ""Act with integrity and treat others with respect"".  Furthermore, on the [Trust & Safety](https://www.airbnb.com/trust/standards) page it says that hosts ""should not fail to disclose hazards and habitability issues"".  In the [Canceling During Your Stay](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/544/canceling-during-your-stay) article it says that ""If your Host cancels your reservation, you will always get a full refund, including all fees and taxes.""  Airbnb told the hosts they can't kick us out for the nonexistent puppy rule, so the hosts instead tell them we violated the rules mentioned in the opening paragraph: that our 6.5lb dog was aggressive toward them and that she kept them up barking at night.  Our puppy did a soft play-growl with their dog, completely non-threatening as she loves all dogs and just wants to play.  Husband Host was there when it happened and even said ""aww she just wants to play.""  Our dog did bark a bit at night as we got her used to crate training, but after a week she was good.  Here's our issue with these alleged ""rule violations"": 1) the aggressiveness thing is a straight up lie / intentional misrepresentation and 2) the hosts NEVER came to us with these issues.  As stated in the [Guest Reliability Standards](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2894/guest-reliability-standards), the host is supposed to communicate issues with the guest to find resolutions.  Not to mention, they only brought this up to Airbnb 6 days after telling us to leave and 1 day after we left for a hotel, and again only after getting caught lying about the ""no puppy"" rule.  We typed this all out to Airbnb (because of course we can't get them on the phone), but nevertheless they ""determined"" we violated the rules and are therefore ineligible for a full refund.
9. **Day 15:** We go back to the residence to grab all of our stuff and move it out.  We spend 9 hours cleaning the place because we are paranoid that they're going to try to charge us for damages.  Admittedly our dog peed on the rugs (not carpets) a bit and those may need professional cleaning even though we did our best.  The host mentioned ""10s of thousands of dollars"" for replacing their floors, although our dog never peed on their floor for whatever reason.  We hand scrubbed the entire floor and treated all the rugs with stain and odor remover.   Obviously we also cleaned up the best we could each time our dog peed, immediately, as we always had our eyes on her.  If we damaged their rugs, we're happy to pay for them.

Now we are at a hotel with all of our stuff, paying 30% higher nightly rate than our Airbnb, with a puppy, both working from home, and desperately trying to find new housing.  Airbnb has not responded to our messages for 48 hours and I think they are willfully ignoring us.  Despite saying they'd help, they haven't helped us with housing at all.  We are trying to decide whether to accept the hosts' proposal to shorten the stay to the time we spent there and pay them for 2+ weeks of rent, and obviously minus the service fee, or whether to go to the Resolution Center and ask for a full refund.  The other option is to pursue a dispute through our Capital One credit card.  I spoke with them today and they said it would be tough to get back the money for the days that we stayed at the home.  At the end of the day we feel like even if we should have been more aware there could have been sensitivity to a puppy vs a dog, that the host 1) should not allow any dogs in a home with such EXPENSIVE FLOORS because even housebroken dogs pee in new environments sometimes, 2) should have written that rule out explicitly, 3) should have checked to see the age / condition of our dog when we mentioned we were bringing one if they're so sensitive about it, 4) SHOULD NOT HAVE LIED TO US about the no puppy rule they made up retroactively, 5) should have made an earnest effort to work something out or accept compensation for damages, 6) should not have willfully misinterpreted our genuine, thoughtful letter, 7) should not have called us deceitful or sneaky when they are the ones who actually got caught lying, and 8 ) should not have threatened legal action.  As awful as they have been to us, we feel like Airbnb dropped the ball even harder because if they responded with a person dedicated to our case who worked with any sort of care that 1) we could have gotten out of there quicker and 2) tensions would not have blown up over the course of the week.  Why did Airbnb tell us they would help us with finding / affording a new place if they never intended to?  If we knew they wouldn't do anything, WE WOULDN'T HAVE WAITED FOR THEM TO HELP US AND WE WOULD HAVE LEFT SOONER!  We felt like their customer service system was designed to not be of assistance for mediation and instead they intentionally ignored us to have us hash it out ourselves, but when your host doesn't believe anything you say and makes threats how are we as guests supposed to deal with that?

If you've made it this far, congratulations.  Open to any and all feedback, critical or supportive of us.  Please provide recommended next steps if possible.

Airbnb,am I (guest) possibly being double booked? [USA],"Hi guys, I am having a lot of my overseas family come over for my wedding in Los Angeles. My family and I have decided to stay together at an AirBNB as a group to prepare for the wedding and to spend time together, as we haven't seen many family members in a while. We plan to all stay together (14 people) so we needed a larger place.

We came across a listing that looked great and within budget, but it was a brand new listing, so I was a little wary of it at first and decided to keep looking. During my search, I came across the same exact listing on AirBNB again, but thru a different host, which was wierd to me and another reason why I decided to wait on it and see. The 2 hosts had similar profile pictures, so I thought it might also be a team posting multiple listings together. Over the weekend, one of the listings became unavailable for our dates, but the other was still available. A review also popped up for the place, so I figured it was a real place.

I ended up booking the same location thru the second host, with the 48 hour full refund deadline.  However, now I am questioning if I've been double booked. I sent the host a message earlier today after booking to confirm I haven't been double-booked, but was left on read.

With 14 people in need of a place to stay, it is really scary to think that I've been overbooked only to find out last minute. Our booking is for the end of May, but it is hard enough as it is with such little availability for large parties in general.

What do you guys think is going on? Am I being bamboozled?

----------------  
UPDATE: I called AirBNB support and they told me that after checking out both listings, they said the one I booked was fine and that my reservation was good. According to AirBNB support I was not double booked, and that the other host was a team with my host and decided to block out those dates before I booked.. It still feels a little sus to me, but I guess we'll see. I'm also still seeing the same listing available on other sites such as VRBO for the same dates, but that is out of AirBNB's scope at that point.

Airbnb,Alternatives to AirBNB,"Recently Airbnb’s customer service has become unbearable. And they’re blatantly violating their own extenuating policy. Customers in the hundreds, perhaps thousands are complaining on Twitter and Reddit, including myself. I was once a loyal customer but it’s the same old story that once it becomes a monopoly, it stops being a good product.

KTLA 5 --

An alleged scammer who is accused of using listings on Airbnb and other vacation rental sites to defraud would-be tenants has been indicted on federal charges.

Shray Goel faces charges of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, according to an indictment filed last month.

Goel, believed to be about 35 years old, and accomplices allegedly used “a variety of fake host accounts on Airbnb and Vrbo” to net about $7 million, according to Court Watch and 404 Media, which reported the indictment on Tuesday.

Between January 2018 and November 2019, Goel and others “would allegedly double book their rental properties, meaning that multiple parties were supposed to stay at them at the same time,” the report said.

“They would then trick customers into taking replacement bookings at inferior residences, and find ways to refuse refunds to guests who were entitled to them, the court record reads,” according to Court Watch and 404 Media. “In some cases, Goel and others listed properties that they were not affiliated with at all, or which did not exist.”

The alleged fraud involved properties in Los Angeles, Malibu and Marina del Rey, according to the indictment, as well as locations across the U.S.

“The scheme involved nearly 100 properties across much of the country, including California, Colorado, Illinois, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, Texas, Tennessee, and Wisconsin,” the report said.

The alleged grift came to prominence in a 2019 Vice report after the author, Allie Conti, was victimized. In that report, a screenshot of Goel’s LinkedIn page showed he was based in Los Angeles.

A Twitter account that appears to belong to Goel was active as of Dec. 29, 2023, but has not responded to a request for comment by 404 Media.",28,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/18x1npn/alleged_airbnb_fraudster_based_in_la_indicted_on/,2024-01-02 21:58:29,Vrbo
Airbnb,I'm done with Airbnb.,"I've had a couple good experiences with Airbnb in the last few years. But as I write this post from the comfort of a hotel after a horrible Airbnb experience, I decided I'm done.

I've always had an issue with Airbnb's but nothing has been as bad as today. Low water pressure, no hot water, broken A/C, is all stuff I can deal with - until I showed up to my rental today.

I booked an ""entire house"" a few months ago with someone who had decent ratings. The listing was described as the entire house, and I was to be staying there with 4 other people, 2 of which are handicapped. Arriving at the house, we discovered that no, we didn't have the entire house and that the host was renting out the bottom floor to different tenants. Surprised, but hopefully optimistic, we opened our door and discovered a steep flight of 20 stairs that we needed to ascent to the second floor (our living area, not mentioned in the listing description). Again, I have 2 handicapped people with me. This is not good. One side of the railing only goes up halfway and the other side doesn't reach the top, so they have nothing to hold onto while going up. To add to that, the stairs are carpeted and sloping backward. A photo of the stairs was not provided on the listing. 

Once we make it up the stairs, we come out into a living area without a working light, iron bars over the windows, and walls that don't go up to the ceilings. The kitchen chairs are worse quality than Ikea, and barely support my weight (140 lbs). The kitchen has metal plates and bowls that look like they just came from Goodwill or Boy Scouts summer camp. The provided ""tissues"" are napkins that look like they were stolen from a fast food establishment, and the provided sponges were obviously previously used - GROSS. Half of the outlets in the residence don't work, or are placed in a way that violates the electrical code. Add  dirty floors, a lack of bath towels, plus gunshots outside, and I was done. 

When bringing this issue up with Airbnb, they failed to see the issues I described, just telling me to discuss with the host who obviously wasn't interested in helping me, only in my money. The fact that the host needs to approve a refund is total BS, especially if the host doesn't do anything to try to resolve the issues - customer service anyone? I have pretty low standards for living quarters so if I can't deal with it, it's pretty bad. I feel bad for good hosts out there that want to make a good experience for their guests, but right now, Airbnb is over saturated with horrible hosts who are only interested in profits and reaping the benefits of the short term rental market.

Airbnb,Sick and tired of being woken up in the middle of the night by Airbnb guests,"Since March, we have a new neighbor who bought their ~~apartment~~ condo for the purpose of short term rentals. Most of the guests stay one night, come with a bunch of friends, and party. They keep waking us up at 3 or 4am. It’s super frustrating. They don’t realize the noise they make. Usually they apologize and bring the volume down, but by then it’s too late. Our night is ruined. It’s getting old having to knock on the door and tell new people every time to please, kindly, STFU. We’ve reported this to Airbnb multiple times, but apparently this has no effect.

EDIT: specified that the property is a condo, not an apartment.

UPDATE:

I forgot to mention that we've already filed 4 complaints in the Airbnb neighborhood feature, and Airbnb did tell us that they contacted the owner to let them know. This so far hasn't solved anything. I just managed today to reach out to the host myself on Airbnb, and for now they've just apologized and seem to think there's nothing they can do.

Airbnb,Got branded a “Party risk” before a big family trip [Canada],"Hello. I am from Mongolia.
Have been using Airbnb for a year now and I had 3 trips in total. In all three cases it was my big family who came with me on those. The platform was convenient because you can rent out a whole house for us to stay in.
After searching for a suitable housing arrangement for the upcoming trip I was told that I am now unable to rent out the whole place anymore since there’s “a probability of unsanctioned party.” After contacting support I received an email saying that the decision stays intact because the “peculiarities of my booking indicate that the rented accommodations will be used for hosting a party.” It’s a 3 week long trip to Toronto with 2 adults and 3 kids that are going to live in a suburban townhouse. It’s not very obvious to me which of these criteria indicate a party to Airbnb.

For the previous 3 trips I have 2 positive reviews and one location that did not comment anything.

How can I get this removed? Anyone had a similar experience?",10,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1d3aeyh/got_branded_a_party_risk_before_a_big_family_trip/,2024-05-29 11:57:54,Vrbo

Airbnb,Rented an AirBnB to house everyone for Thanksgiving. 10 adults in all and a very nice place. Paid for the second half of the booking and host is requesting that we cancel due to double-booking. What are our options?,"The Airbnb host accepted initial deposit for half the amount upon reservation in early August. The other half was paid 2 weeks to the reservation start date. Host calls the day after receiving the 2nd payment and requests us to cancel after informing us that they double-booked on VRBO.

Since the host is informing us so last minute, there aren’t any options within a reasonable distance to choose from.

Is it possible for us to verify that the host had the reservation booked prior to us reserving / paying? Just to confirm he’s not doing a favor for a family friend or something.

We are denying the request to cancel because it is the hosts fault. Other than a full refund, what happens next?

Update: The cancellation from the host went through and we were able to find another place, albeit not as good as what we had originally found, but it’ll bring the family together. Full refund and from what I can tell by tue language of the host, he got a pretty hefty penalty. As a host, please do your due diligence and don’t double book MONTHS out.

Airbnb,Got cancelled less than 24 hours from my reservation,"I had planned the holidays weeks in advance, I booked a stay at a hotel through airbnb. Then less than 24 hours from my checkin, I received an email that my reservation had been cancelled.

I went through support while they offered me ""similar or better homes"". The problem is that I am attending a concert, everything was fully booked and nothing available on airbnb unless I paid over 3 times what my original booking was for. Airbnb support offered me completely worse properties, hours away from where my booking was.

The only thing they are offering is an 18$ voucher TO USE ON MY NEXT RESERVATION THROUGH Airbnb.

I took my time and began calling the hotels in the area and I was able to book a room for 62$ more than the reservation I had through airbnb. It only makes sense they should take that loss as it was an issue caused on their behalf. 

They have refused to do so and only thing is an 18$ voucher.

Airbnb,Help with calendar link. iCal question? [USA],"Basically we use a very simple calendar to organize our homes as a small host.

It is linked via ICal from Airbnb and other host sites, but only one way. So Airbnb sends reservations to our calendar via iCal but the calendar we use is not linked to send any information back to Airbnb.

We got a reservation for October in our beach cottage calendar and could not find any information in our email or our Airbnb app. Called Airbnb support who confirmed the confirmation number, dates and guest phone number I have in the calendar are all correct but the booking is with someone else. Not me.

They are trying to blame the simple calendar software, which I think is impossible? iCal links send info one direction, that’s why you have to link vrbo out to airbnb AND airbnb in to vrbo correct? Since the simple calendar is only receiving information this HAS to be an airbnb  tech issue right?

Airbnb,Frustrations with Airbnb Support: Unfair Handling of Refund Disputes,"I just wanted to share an experience I recently had with Airbnb Support, which left me feeling frustrated and unheard. I am hoping some of you might have been in a similar situation or have some advice on how to navigate this.  
  
Here's what happened: I hosted a guest who found some items left by previous guests under the trundle bed. Upon being notified, I immediately offered to send cleaners, but the guest declined and insisted that it wasn't necessary, that they were just letting me know and that thanks. However, after her departure, she lodged a refund request.  
  
As required, I engaged with the Airbnb Support team, explained the situation, and provided evidence. I felt that I had adhered to Airbnb's guidelines, and thankfully, they agreed - the guest's refund request was denied and the case was closed.  
  
To my surprise, a new case was later opened via the 'helping a guest cancel their reservation' process. I was told to either reach an agreement with the guest or a decision would be made on my behalf - even though the original case had already been closed.  
  
The two things that really irk me are:  
  
\- The circumvention of Airbnb's case resolution procedures, where a new case was created post the initial case closure. It felt like an underhanded tactic to bypass the initial decision.

  
\- The apparent misinterpretation and misapplication of Airbnb's policies by the involved Airbnb Support staff. Airbnb's policy clearly states that the host should attempt to resolve any issues (which I did) and the guest is required to report any problems within 72 hours. However, the guest reported the issue several days after her departure, making her refund request invalid based on Airbnb's guidelines. Despite this, the Support staff seemed to have overlooked this crucial detail.

  
This ordeal cost me spending the weeking hassling around this. More than the financial and personal loss, it's the feeling of being treated unfairly that stings the most. As hosts, we try to provide the best experience for our guests, and it's disheartening when our efforts are disregarded.  
  
Has anyone else had similar experiences? Is there a better way to handle this kind of situation? And is there a channel to escalate such issues within Airbnb?  
  
Thanks for taking the time to read my rant. Here's to hoping for fairer resolutions in the future!",22,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/15160pe/frustrations_with_airbnb_support_unfair_handling/,2023-07-16 13:14:48,Vrbo
Airbnb,Host falsely accusing me of having a dog and charging $215 cleaning fee.,"I recently stayed in a condo for 4 days. I was a bit concerned about this rental because it was a new listing with no reviews, but I messaged with the owner, and she claimed that she had recently bought it so that her family of 4 could spend time with nearby family. 

We were pretty happy with the rental, but as soon as we left, received a message asking if we had brought a dog, and claiming that the property manager found short black hairs. 

I replied that we did not bring a dog, but had one at home. The only thing that I could imagine was that the robes we brought from home had some dog hair on them, so I offered that as a possible explanation. However, I did not see any dog hair on anything while I was there, and I felt like we left the property looking pretty clean. We had already paid almost a $100 cleaning fee to start with. There is no possible way that there was $300 worth of cleaning to do after we left, especially since there was NO dog there. 

The owner is now filing a claim for $215. This is my first time to use AirBnB, so I’m not sure what my options are. (I have used VRBO several times without incident.)

I’m concerned that this is some sort of scam. We were wanting to extend our vacation and I was searching for another unit in the same condo complex. Someone else had the exact same story from a few months ago! (Except in their case, they had paid a deposit that was never returned.)

Airbnb,"Guest lied and threw a massive after-prom party, damaging home and property.

Airbnb support is dumpster juice trash.","TL:DR: My wife and I are superhosts that were taken advantage of by an individual that elected to host a large after-prom party in our home. Despite 500 dollar security deposit and at least 1440 of damages at the time of submitting the request, Airbnb decided upon 0 dollars of compensation.

Here's the summary of events submitted to Airbnb:  
""Kevin booked our house for himself, no additional guests, mentioning that he wanted to ""relax  for the weekend a quiet getaway"" and that he ""wanted a more comfortable space Other then a hotel"".   
  
Shortly after arriving our security door sensors would not stop going off. I followed to inspect what was going on with our exterior house camera. I could see numerous people entering and exiting the house repetitively. When I asked him about this, he said some friends coming to take him out.  
   
He then went to the security camera and moved it to point away from the front door and the exterior to obscure the on-goings. However, the door sensors continued to alert my phone virtually every few minutes for the next few of hours. Through the audio I could hear excessively loud music and numerous people interacting. I assumed a party of a 8, 12, hell maybe 20 at this point possibly?   
  
At this point I called Airbnb support who asked me to prove to them that he was having a party and that they would call him to check. Airbnb support, after speaking to Kevin, informed me that he said there wasn't a party. I asked them what to do from here. I waited for approximately half an hour for someone from Airbnb support to tell me to call the police.   
  
I did not want to call the police as I was apprehensive that it may be escalating the situation more than it needed to be. I drove to the house myself with my wife and a friend.  
  
When we arrived the street was overflowing with cars, with approximately 10-20 people outside. A large black school-bus type party bus was parked outside the house. Apparently, a local high school's senior prom had ended that night and this was a mixture of ex-graduates and recent graduates of Warren Central.  
  
After numerous people trying to obstruct me from trying to enter or view the property and stating that both no one knew a Kevin... or, even better, that I needed to get out of there because the owner of the house wasn't me, the group dispersed.   
  
How did I almost instantly get 50-70 young ""adults"" to exit the house? I said the police were coming.  
  
At this point, I enter the house after waiting for a clown-car like exodus of people to the most incredible amount of marijuana smoke to the point it obstructed vision. It still after massive cleaning slightly smells of pot but hopefully to the point a guest doesn't notice.  
  
About 7 or 8 men are still in the house telling me they are not leaving, that the house and party is paid for and there is no Kevin.   
  
Kevin then eventually comes downstairs and I tell him all of his guests have to get out and he's broken the contract. Kevin then informs me that he's ""not even going to lie"" and that ""it is what it is"" and he was sorry and would cover the damages of the house.   
  
Some of his friends have also now stood up and stepped towards me demanding ""their money"". I told them Kevin could get his money back from Airbnb, partially to defuse the situation and get these guys to exit.  
  
Somehow in addition to these guys downstairs, another group of about 10 to 12 also then come downstairs out of a small 10x10 room. One of the young men comments on his way out that I'm not going to like what I see up there.  
  
Sometime around now the police actually arrive due to the disturbance and party. I have elderly neighbors on one side with a cardiac condition and on the other a mother with 3 children including an infant. I'm sure they absolutely love me (and Kevin's friends) right now.  
  
At this point we go back and forth on Airbnb messaging regarding the damages. I have not even submitted all of the damages to this -- I didn't realize I wouldn't be able to update.   
  
The fact of the matter is I suspect Kevin won't pay anything and I won't receive anything beyond the security deposit so this is probably a giant waste of my time.  
  
Please read the chat history between us for the absurdity of him accepting blame and ""taking responsibility"" for the various damages -- to later try to back up and pretend like it was some small little gathering. Including when he references taking the down the party from social media as to try to get people to stop showing up to the house well after it ""ended"" and police arrived.  
  
I also have the audio of him talking about the lock breaking, the audio of him talking about trying to fake out the camera, audio clips of the party, small clips when the camera finally sort of slunk down and you could see pieces of the party before someone unplugs it and then after I arrived and plug it back in for the police arriving.  
  
Please let me know what you need or I can provide to recuperate any of these damages.  
  
Let me know if it, or how it is possible for us to recoup beyond the security deposit.""   
  
_______________________  
   
To this Airbnb decided to reward NOTHING. They additionally elected to leave up his false review that claims, ""host very rude judge mental lied about how home is presented items broken apon arrival junk everywhere in the home"".  
We will now likely take this indivual to small claims court and are looking to shift our listing to Home Away and/or VRBO.

Airbnb,Various platforms and different guests and advice / input (North America) [USA],"  
Long time host on many platforms.

Over the years we have encountered many different types of guests. In the past year things have become more .. decisive. Interested to know if other multiple platform hosts notice anything recently.

1) Air BNB guests 
Polite, usually responsible and respectful - as they know and appreciate they are graded or reviewed for their stay. 
Airbnb has extensive coverage and kicks off guests.

2) VRBO 
Slightly higher end, a little bit more demanding, usually great guests, have slightly higher expectations, mostly north America. 
VRBO support is way worse than air BNB.

3) Booking.com
Mostly international. Treat places like hotels. More messy, less communication. Various different people from around the world. I think people that have been kicked off or don't use other platforms go here first.
Mostly good guests, but what support *crickets*

Airbnb,Neighbors to our AirBnB hosting wild parties IN our AirBnB,"Asking for advice from other hosts. Most of our guests have been absolutely great, however.. We have neighbors next to our family cottage that we rent out via AirBnB and VRBO who often have big parties on holidays (including some minor ones). They have now twice used our Airbnb for spill over of these parties, though they have always denied it. Both times we've had confirmation/complaints from other neighbors that they were hosting the party there. 

They always get someone random with a backstory of ""just traveling through""  or ""girls getaway with sister"" etc to book our cottage. 

We have tried to build a relationship with them, be good neighbors, etc. But nothing works.

After the most recent party where the singular ""guest"" was incredibly rude, broke furniture and left a huge mess (during a one night stay), we are done trying to reason with them. Here's our plan to avoid this on the future:

-Install a ring doorbell and cameras at front and back entrances
-Decline bookings from guests with few or no reviews
-No one night stays near/on holidays 
-Call the cops anytime a loud party of theirs goes past a reasonable hour

Should we let Airbnb guests know they should notify us or police for loud parties during their stay? We don't want to scare off our guests!

Airbnb,TIL — Airbnb has no company policy for bereavement cancellations,"My family had a 10-day trip to Puerto Rico planned and my mother in law passed the day before our flight. I was able to cancel everything (hotel, rental car, excursions) with refunds in an hour with the exception of a flight with United (credits and refund provided with proof, which I understand — sent obituary and got the refund the next day) and Airbnb.

I am extremely disappointed in how they have handled it.

First I reached out directly to support assuming they would just handle it. Instead they told me I have to work with the host to negotiate a refund.

The host gave me a partial refund. If Airbnb left it at that, I would have been slightly annoyed, but moved on with my life.

But no.

First Airbnb asked me to send proof of death, which gave me hope they would actually resolve it. They did not.

They have called me, messaged me, and generally irritated me about a sensitive subject at least 5 times over the past week. Every time it’s a different person and every time it’s the same line “Sorry, we don’t give bereavement refunds. It’s at the discretion of the host.”

I’m extremely busy and stressed between parenting a toddler, consoling my wife, helping plan a funeral, and dealing with the inevitable family conflict that comes up around a death. 

I’ve used Airbnb for 10 years and generally had good experiences, but this might be the thing that pushes me to vrbo and other platforms. 

The consumer pays the fee. This is a basic courtesy that all other travel companies address without question. I thought Airbnb was a real company that isn’t absolute garbage. Alas, here we are.

Update: right after I posted this, they sent me a message that said I still needed to provide the necessary of documentation of death. I responded with the screencap of the message I sent last week with that info 😭

Update 2.0: when I called them out on not reading the message where I sent the obituary, they refunded me. I think the lesson here is Airbnb has pretty bad customer service.

And yeah, yeah, I hear you all on the travel insurance. The point is regardless of tos all other companies were respectful enough to refund me without having to deal with a REALLY bad cs experience. I honestly would have been fine and dropped it if they just said no, but they kept stringing me along.

Can you reply here with your email address, phone number, and full name on your profile so we can authenticate your account and follow-up?"" (which I've answered, with my information, twice now) - and - ""We appreciate your continued support with Airbnb, \*\*\*\*\*. Rest assured your case is with our specialised team now, and your Case Manager will do their best to help you. Thank you once again for your patience"" (which I've been told twice now, over the course of 5 days).

&#x200B;

I have a good friend who had a similar issue. Her account was banned without explanation; she has no criminal record, all 5 star reviews, and no derogatory marks. She said that upon trying to log in to her mother's airbnb account on her computer, she got the same error message, and shortly after her mother's account was banned. She made the mistake of trying again with her father's account on her computer, and he was banned for life as well.

&#x200B;

The only possible explanation I've theorized: 3 years ago I was abroad in Australia. I stayed at an airbnb with some friends. While I slept, they drank and broke a vinegar bottle and one wine glass. We settled everything through Airbnb, they paid her $400 AUD, and she told me she would not leave me a negative review as she knew it was not my fault. I have also stayed in multiple Airbnb's since this occasion; so banning me 3 years later after multiple 5 star reviewed stays, and a completely financially settled case that left me with nothing but a good review, makes little to no sense to me.

&#x200B;

My mother is a super host with Airbnb, and is hell bent on trying to solve this as she sees the outright nonsense of the situation as well. Via my research, it seems to be a somewhat common and inexplicable occurrence. At most, I've read that someone who has connections to someone else with a criminal record, has been banned for life. I've also read that this happened to people with multiple accounts. Neither of these situations apply to me whatsoever. What is going on here?! Has anyone else experienced this?

\*\*(If it helps at all, I was the victim of identity theft when I was 16 years old. From what I understand, that has been completely resolved)\*\*

Any help, advice, or similar experiences shared would be so very helpful. I'm at a loss, and pretty bummed that I no longer can use this site to book a spot to stay in when I visit my terminally ill grandmother next month. Thank you guys!

UPDATE:   


I have called customer service so many times now. Same answer each time. When I message them on facebook, they ask for my e-mail, phone number, and name. Over and over again. I finally commented my story on their facebook page, posting it on two of their recently uploaded photos.

Then... THEY BLOCKED ME FROM COMMENTING, CONTACTING THEM, AND DELETED MY COMMENTS (on facebook).

I've made a twitter account.. I don't really know how to use it yet but here is my account page: [https://twitter.com/cheeseandpsych/with\_replies](https://twitter.com/cheeseandpsych/with_replies)

Hopefully that shows up for you guys. Please spread the word and retweet if you're in the mood.

I feel absolutely powerless and overtaken. I don't know what to do, but it seems as I should give up. This is a complete scam, and entirely unjust. Customer service is nonexistent based on how much they've ""helped"" me. Lastly, please take a moment to read through the top voted comments on their posts on facebook. Hundreds of other people have had the same experience I did, and many more have experienced far worse. They reply by asking for people's information, saying they'll get back to them. They never do. If you complain further like I did, you'll get blocked even on their facebook.

Do not trust your time and money with Airbnb...

Airbnb,Guests please do NOT mention details of special accommodations in your reviews!,"We just got an annoying review from a piece of work lady, rating us overall 3 stars because she felt like the space was “small”, and a 4 star in accuracy because the portable AC was “loud at night” (beach town and our night time temps are in the low 60deg F year round. 

But the thing that truly ticked us off was she had asked for access to a larger space to have her sister over for a socially distanced visit, she felt the private patio we provide would be too small. We made special accommodations to let her use the backyard that our dogs and toddler have normally unrestricted access to, and she mentioned in detail that in her review and how nice it was. Super frustrating because we do NOT want this to be routine for guests to ask for. 

So other guests, if you get early check in, late checkout, additional accommodations, don’t mention details! Thank privately, mention great customer service or special considerations etc. 

And, quite frankly, if you ask for anything above the listing and are granted you need to have a GOOD reason to not rate 5 stars.

Airbnb,Account suspension and 22 canceled reservations overnight! Anyone else?,"This weekend Airbnb suspended my 3 Superhost listings during high season at the beach. They sent cancellation emails to 22 guests saying simply the reservation wasn’t legitimate, no further explanation. 7 phone calls over the weekend and Monday have all given the same non-answer that the “account suspension department” will email me at some undetermined time to give me a report. 
How is it ok to do that prior to at least notifying me or giving me a chance to deal with whatever it is that they have suspended me for? I’ve no bad reviews or issues with any homes and I dint have a criminal background! 
Im going insane but luckily use channel manager software so I have the names and contact info of the guests to get in touch. 
Has this happened to anyone else?

—Update—
Was able to contact  20 of the 22 guests and rebooked 17 of them bc of channel manager info. Had to back into their prices and adjust for higher Vrbo rates. I was assigned to an awesome VRBO specialist who immediately started getting the listings back up. She tried to use the airbnb links to copy any information and photos she could, but airbnb platform suspension wouldn’t let her. She said this is not the first time she’s had to deal with something like this.  So I’m on Vrbo now and since airbnb still has all my calendar blocked I had to stop using your Porter bc they are based on Airbnb, did a quick switch to igms and things are almost back to normal. Still no word or explanation from Airbnb. 

So they suck, however, the cool thing was the guests were actually really amazing throughout the whole thing and flexible and patient. That was certainly heartening. One even said they’d canceled on him before and he wasn’t surprised at all. Good folks. Even those who didn’t rebook were polite and easy.",75,58,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/onhtzl/account_suspension_and_22_canceled_reservations/,2021-07-19 16:42:29,Vrbo
Airbnb,"I got permanently banned from the platform. I tried booking for an upcoming trip, kept getting error messages, contacted support (via phone line), got an email that said I was banned. I haven’t used Airbnb in 4 years?","Basically, the title. They said they didn’t have to give an explanation, just that I could never create an account with them again. Just wondering if this has happened to anyone else?

At first, customer support said maybe it was locked due to inactivity for so long. They said they’d get back to me within 24 hours. And now I’m banned. 4 years ago, I messaged about a host that I had a hard time with. I’ve maybe booked 2 or 3 times total and had no other problems. They said I don’t align with the community standards? My profile is positive and upbeat so I’m just confused, though I’ve seen a lot of posts on here about similar experiences. Probably for the better, Airbnb seems like it’s all over the place, nothing but problems. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Update: I stand corrected. The email does not say they don’t have to provide an explanation, I have no idea where I came up with that (brain fog today). My account has been removed, is not accessible, and I cannot create another one. They said my profile doesn’t comply with safety standards nor terms of service and they cannot offer any more support. I called customer support again, it sounds like it’s still open and they took my account down and they’re still looking into it.

Airbnb,Never stayed in a house with host/family b4 [USA],"Greetings,

I'm relatively new to AirBnB. So far, I've only stayed in places where I have the unit to myself or a hostel room that had it's own living room, private bathroom, & fridge, where the only thing shared was a kitchen.

I'm looking for a similar place now for a 4-5 day stay & only see places where it's a room in a host's house.  The main reason why I like units to myself is that I can keep strange hours, take phone calls very late at night, need a small space to play VR boxing for exercise. I have a few larger totes with me that I'd rather not leave in my vehicle overnight so space is also a consideration.  Also, I cook food when I'm hungry - even if that's at 3am. 

I fear my irregular hours may not fit well if I'm staying in a home with a host/family. As a result, I might not do any activites, like make food when I'm hungry or play VR,  between the hours of 10pm-7am, because I don't want to be rude or cause an issue with anybody else.

Is my concern justified? Any recommendations or ideas?",7,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1b52kpg/never_stayed_in_a_house_with_hostfamily_b4_usa/,2024-03-02 23:48:22,Vrbo

Airbnb,Airbnb really does always side with the guest.,"I host a duplex. Been hosting at the spot for coming up on 2 years as a superhost. Its a two story, split down the middle with a left and right side. I recently had a guest request a refund around 10PM at night saying she could not get in and I was not responding. Of course I was like...????? 

Come to find out she had called me once, left no voicemail message, and gave up after trying her code on the wrong door despite my explicit instructions that it was the right side door. No text from her, no airbnb message, just one phone call and no voicemail at 8PM while I was putting my toddler to bed and then the refund request at 10PM. It took me about 5 minutes of messaging her after the refund request to figure out she was at the wrong door. I've hosted 100's of people and this was a first.

I offered her the $50 cleaning fee back but not the full refund because its a holiday weekend and even though she did not stay, my place was booked out those nights. It escalated to airbnb ""support"" and of course they gave her the refund. Now I'm out hundreds of dollars because this chick doesn't know her left from her right. And support had the nerve to send me some articles and suggest I raise my standards? Anyways, what do you guys know about Vrbo from the hosts angle?

Airbnb,"Property Management Companies Posing As Host [NC, USA]","Long story short, this Friday July 21st we're heading to what will most certainly be our last airbnb trip. We were quite surprised to find our 'host' is actually a property management company that handles a large number of rentals on airbnb, vrbo, various travel sites and their own web site. Needless to say, these 'hosts' hit you with the most fees. For example, the 2 BR house we're renting comes with a $175 cleaning fee.  While we agreed to this when we booked the place, it was our last interaction with the host that was the final straw (see below). 

To summarize just how much of a rip off these fees are let's take the nightly fee of the place we rented, which was $195/night for 5 nights. With cleaning fee, airbnb fees and taxes the nightly rate ended up being $350/night for a total of $1750, which is a whopping 80% surcharge over the original nightly rate. Now, we knew all of this at the time of booking and I wasn't happy about it at the time. But my wife really liked the place so we booked it and that was that. Here is the final straw for us:

In February when we booked the place the host asked that we tell them our travel plans, as far as arrival. So I asked a fair enough question....the check-in is at 4pm, the latest allowed by airbnb. So I asked if it might be possible to get in earlier, say 2-3pm range. Here is that exchange from February:

&#x200B;

* Me: Would it be possible to check in between 2-3pm on Friday July 21st? Thanks so much.
* Host: Hi x! Typically the cleaners need the full time (until 3pm) . Please check with us the day of and we can check for you! Thank you.

This week I gave the host a heads-up regarding our messages from February and said I would be in touch Friday. But, this time I was shocked by their reply:

&#x200B;

* Me: Hello, just a heads up. When we booked in Feb I asked about the possibility of arriving early Friday and you said to check back Friday. I'll message you on Friday.
* Host: Hi x! Sounds good. We do charge a small fee for early check-in. Just so you're aware.
* Me: Interesting. And where was this disclosed and why wasn't it mentioned in our earlier exchange?
* Host: The cleaner has a new fee policy that was put in place a few months ago. It's $25 for each hour prior to the OG check-in time. So $100 for noon, $75 for 1:00 pm, $50 for 2:00 and $25 for 3pm! Let me know if you'd like to move forward with this.
* Me: No thanks!

So this particular professional host Bright Host, (which was never disclosed on airbnb as a property management company, in fact the profile has a person's picture not a corporate logo) is not happy collecting their nightly rate, plus $175 cleaning fee. They want more. Even more repulsive is that the place we're renting is not occupied this week before we arrive, so no cleaners there on July 21st at all. Yet, they want to charge me a 'cleaner imposed' fee. Right.

I contacted airbnb support and complained about this host and what they were trying to pull with 'new fees'. Airbnb said basically the hosts set the rules and they can't do anything about it. I'm only sharing this experience because we've had great hosts in the past. Individuals that were awesome to work with and very responsive to any questions. But, property management companies seem to be none of the above. Don't get duped like we were into thinking you're renting from a person when in fact we're renting from a company with a General Manager (who replied with the cleaning fees comment).

After a week+ of back and forth between myself and ""Customer Service""  I was informed that there was nothing they could do and that I forfeited any remaining funds (in this case, $950).  In my messages, I went into great detail why  the host was irresponsible and how he could not show that there ever was a key, while I had plenty of documentation that there was not one.  

Naturally I am incensed!  I informed the agent that I was deleting my Airbnb account and will never use them again (and have done so).  After 7 good stays and very positive reviews, they chose to throw away my loyalty in favor of a host with 2 previous reviews, one of them bad.  

All I can say is ""Buyer Beware"".  Airbnb offers very few protections and the customer service is awful.  My experiences with hosts up to now have been only positive, but I won't put my money at risk any more. 

One more thing to note is that in spite of my awful experience, Airbnb was fully compensated.  They did not give up one cent of their commissions, while I did not spend one night in their place.  There was ZERO evidence of good faith.  Just another large company doing everything possible to squeeze every last cent out of their customers.

Airbnb,"Unjustified Suspension & Financial Loss: A Tale of Airbnb's Host Support [Istanbul, Turkey]","Hello fellow Airbnb hosts and guests, I'm reaching out to share an ongoing issue I'm experiencing with Airbnb, and to hopefully get some advice on how to best navigate this situation.  
  
Recently, I had a guest who made a booking with one of my listings. The guest made false claims regarding the amenities in my property, specifically about the lack of air conditioning in the bedroom, while it was clearly mentioned in my listing description that the A/C is located only in the living room.  
  
Airbnb proceeded to cancel the guest's reservation immediately contrary to my strict cancellation policy, refunded the guest 30% for the days they had stayed, and the full amount for the remaining days based on these false claims. Despite numerous attempts to communicate the situation to Airbnb, the issue continued unresolved for several days. Meanwhile, Airbnb also suspended my listing, further exacerbating the financial impact on me.  
  
Finally, after a prolonged struggle, Airbnb acknowledged that the guest's review was indeed false. I received the following message from Airbnb:  
  
""This is about the review that you want to dispute under the reservation XXXXXXXX where the guest claim that there's no air conditioning inside the bedroom when it clearly shows under your listing description where the air conditioning should only be which is in the living room. We do apologize for all the trouble you encountered in this situation and guest. But since it can clearly be seen in the listing description, I already removed the review for you and it can no longer be seen under your listing profile which you can also check on your end if you want to make sure. Thank you for the huge understanding!""  
  
However, despite the review being removed, my listing continues to be suspended without any clear reasoning, preventing me from accepting new bookings. When I navigate to the page containing information about the suspension, I still see the incorrect claim from the removed review about the air conditioning being ""missing or broken."" The suspension page message reads:  
  
""Due to recent issues, this listing is suspended. You’ll be able to reactivate it on Jul 26, 2023 by agreeing to our ground rules for Hosts. It may take up to 1 day for the latest info to appear. Accuracy issue reported: Air conditioning missing or broken, Jul 15 – 20, 2023 · XXXXXXXX""  
  
Financially, this situation has had a significant impact on me. Instead of receiving the full amount that I was initially set to earn from the booking, I ended up receiving just a fraction due to the unjustified cancellation. Moreover, my listing continues to be suspended, preventing me from accepting new bookings. Given a conservative estimate of daily earnings and a suspension period, I've incurred an additional substantial loss from potential earnings. Thus, I have experienced a significant financial setback due to the unjust actions based on the guest's false claims, and the ongoing suspension of my listing.  
  
Throughout this ordeal, I've consistently tried to communicate with Airbnb, but my appeals and attempts to expedite the resolution have been largely unsuccessful. This experience has left me feeling incredibly frustrated, and the lack of effective resolution from Airbnb's end is disconcerting.  
  
I wanted to share my experience with the community and seek advice on any potential steps I could take to resolve this situation. I am also considering asking Airbnb for compensation for my financial losses. Has anyone else experienced a similar issue? Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated.  
  
Thank you.

Edit: Hello again to all who have been following my post on the challenges I had been facing. Today, I am delighted to share that Airbnb support has solved the problem.

After a thorough review of my appeal, which involved lots of back and forth discussions and providing the Airbnb team with necessary documentation, Airbnb has acknowledged the inconsistency in the guest's claims.

Moreover, Airbnb agreed to reimburse the adjusted amount.

I want to express my deep gratitude to the Airbnb community here on Reddit for their support, advice, and sharing their own experiences throughout this ordeal. It was comforting to know I wasn't alone in this, and I've learned a lot from your shared wisdom.

I also want to extend my thanks to the Airbnb support team for addressing the issue. I understand that the platform isn't perfect, and issues can arise. However, their commitment to resolving problems is commendable.

I hope that my experience can serve as an example for others dealing with similar challenges and provide some guidance on how to navigate such situations. It's a testament to the power of persistence and open communication. 

Thank you again for all the support.

I tried to convince our group not to use AirBnB because a ""pluming emergency"" cancelation last year. I lobbied to just get multiple hotel rooms, but I was out voted by people who wanted the ski house experience and thought AirBnB was going to a better deal for a large group when we booked it 6 months ago. Trip is 3 weeks out and guess what? Another ""plumbing emergency"". 

What plumbing problem wouldn't be resolved in 3 weeks during peak ski season? 

AirBnB's $200 credit doesn't really help when everything still available is now 2-3x what we had a contract to pay and hotel rooms are no longer available.

Never again.

https://abnb.me/MyMS0D331vb is what we booked for $500/night 6 months ago.

Same unit on https://www.vrbo.com/3686284ha same unit for $700/night

Even if I were to book the same unit from this host on both AirBnB and then VRBO for more $$ triggering a ""plumbing emergency"" cancelation, neither platform would do anything.

Airbnb,This support team is a JOKE!,"I recently had a terrible experience with Airbnb. I tried to book a rental but was flagged by their security system. I reached out to the owner of the rental directly, and they said I could rent their home without issue. However, Airbnb continued to insist that I was not eligible to rent, citing a list of security reasons that didn't apply to me at all.

To make matters worse, my family is flying into town and we need a home that can house everyone as I do not have enough room for everyone. I reached out to Airbnb's support team for help, but they gave me the run-around for days. This is still ongoing since April 25th, and they offered no compensation or suitable resolution for the inconvenience they caused.

I have days worth of DMs that would blow you away. It's really disappointing to see how poorly Airbnb treats their customers when they are at fault. The support team is unwilling to put me in contact with someone who has the authority to help me, despite my urgent need for accommodation.

however we tried to rebook and kept getting flagged for having a party, okay whatever, we tried another villa and boom bam bop, still throwing a party, we thought its our account age, so we let the Airbnb host know that we would be using a different account with an older age to get past it, he gives us the go and we do it...

Next, we used a different account with previous bookings \[a 45 y/o women's account\] a group of 1 person and low and behold still flagged for throwing a party.

Airbnb,Friend wants me to help host his AirBnB properties.,"A friend and ex co worker of mine I met abroad working at the same school has two AirBnB properties. He asked if I would be interested in managing his properties when he goes abroad again. I am not in the USA but I said I could help out depending on how I would be compensated for helping him. He didn't want to draw up a contract but after a lot of prodding he came up with this, (some information has been altered to keep sensitive information confidential.)

""Agreement is made this fourth day of February, 2023 buying between /u/shadowchicken85 and shadowchicken's friend (hereinafter referred to as ""the parties"" to the agreement), as follows:

&#x200B;

\#1. Term of contract. The term of this contract shall be for three months initially, renewable by mutual agreement of the parties, via email.

\#2. Real property. The real estate involved shall be located in a southern state in the USA.

\#3. Compensation/Consideration. The split by between the parties shall be Shadowchicken's 10% and Shadowchicken's friend 90% of the gross proceeds received by Shadowchicken from the third party dispersing funds at point of origin. Shadowchicken agrees to disburse Shadowchicken's friend's portion within 24 hours of receipt electronically or in cash funds such as Walmart if Shadowchicken's friend is in the United States, or else via Western Union, MoneyGram, or wire transfer to the bank account of shadowchicken's friend if he is outside of the United States at the time that shadowchicken receives disbursement from the third party. The third party shall be airbnb, vrbo, [booking.com](https://booking.com) etc.

\#4. Shadowchicken shall assume full responsibility for all taxes and requirements such as LLC or other licensure as required by law.""

My question is: am I getting a raw deal for so much responsibility in regards to this offer? 10% seems a little bit low for what he is asking especially since I am not in the USA. One of the reasons why he gave me this offer since he doesn't want to use his social security number for registering with AirBnB and other properties due to 'political reasons.' Originally he only wanted to give me 5% unless I was more 'hands on' in handling the property (talking to guests, coordinating with cleaning staff, stock up the property with toiletries/snacks/etc.)

Note: I haven't agreed to anything yet and haven't set up any accounts for him yet. Thank you for your time.

Edit: I told my friend I am not interested. I didn't sign up or give any tax information so everything is all good.

Airbnb,Pay out of pocket for coffee stain on mattress or file insurance,"My daughter(19) went on trip with friends and a couple acquaintances. It was through vrbo and in her name. She paid the extra 60 for insurance. One of the friends, the friends boyfriend and sister told her coffee got spilled on the comforter the morning they left. They didn't text her about it until after they left. well the owner contacts my daughter and said cleaners contacted him that it was on mattress. That would she be willing to cover cost of mattress or cleaning whichever it needed to be.  She messaged the friend and they did admit it  and that they would pay. My daughter remembered she paid for insurance( that the certain friend who did this complained of paying so my daughter just converted their part) so she asked if that would cover it.  They messaged back today and said it just needed to be professionally cleaned and that with insurance it's a long and  drawn out process and  they think it may still require a deductible from her. So they're asking if they can just send a payment request and be done with it . Not sure what the payment would be as they haven't said yet, so I told her to find out. Is there a deductible with the insurance? Should she just pay for it out of pocket to be professionally cleaned and then have her friends pay her?

Airbnb,Host kicked tenants out early and AirBnB refuses to refund for remaining stay,"My wife, infant, and a couple friends stayed in an AirBnB. We had a great first couple days as the temperature in the house slowly got hotter. 

On the second to last day, I message the host to ask them to turn the AC up (it was under lock and key). He comes by, says we broke the AC (again, we had no control over it), then asks us to leave in 30 minutes. I explained our infant was sleeping and we were expected to stay another night, but he said the police will be here in 30 minutes and we had to go.

We frantically pack our stuff, clean up the house and vacate. We put in a claim with AirBnB to be refunded for the last day since we were removed by the host, all on video, and they deny our claim. 

I've never felt so dismissed by a company I've trusted for so long. How are there no protections in place for residents? I literally had to wake my sleeping infant, pack up all our food, clothes, etc, and leave on a moments notice on a claim that we broke the AC we had no control over.

We were forced to pay for a night to stay somewhere then kicked out of it with no reimbursement. We still have no idea what we did to deserve being treated this way. 

Do not trust AirBnB to protect you. Once the host is paid, there is no incentive or requirement for them to let you stay.",60,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/pwobhf/host_kicked_tenants_out_early_and_airbnb_refuses/,2021-09-27 19:18:56,Vrbo

I'm new to the short-term rental space and am currently in the process of looking for the best property management software to help me manage my properties. I'm looking for recommendations  on some of the most affordable and reliable platforms out there.

Ideally, I'd like something that is user-friendly and can handle all aspects of property management, from reservations and bookings to guest communication, cleaning, and maintenance. I'd also appreciate any advice on which platforms integrate well with popular booking channels like Airbnb, Vrbo, and Booking.com.

 I'm also curious to know whether it's worth creating my own site for direct bookings in addition to using a property management software. Are there any advantages to having a personal site, and if so, what are some of the software platforms that will allow me to embed their booking engine into my site? I've done tons of research on this issue, but I'd like to draw upon some personal experiences before making my final decision.

Airbnb,My Airbnb host telling me that we can’t flush toilet paper down the toilet was the final straw for me today.,"There was NOTHING in the Airbnb description, check in instructions, or reviews saying not to flush toilet paper, but there was a sign on the fridge that said “please don’t flush anything down the toilet including toilet paper.” We are staying with 6 people in a 2 bathroom house in a major US city. Plus the trash can next to the toilet that was designated for the used toilet paper had no lid. The idea of having to stare at 6 people’s feces, urine, and period blood soaked toilet paper all weekend in a tiny bathroom was extremely disturbing. So I messaged the host and here’s how the interaction went: 

Me: “Can we really not flush toilet paper?” 

Host: “Yes, please don’t flush toilet paper.”

Me: “There isn't a lid on the bathroom trash, isn't that unsanitary to have feces toilet paper just out in the open?
It didn't say anything in the listing about that and l'm sorry but that is SO unsanitary and l've never heard of anything like that, l'm not sure what we are expected to do?”

Host: “Okay. You can flush the toilet paper. We were being extra strict to prevent guests from flushing everything in there. Sorry for the confusion.”

Bro. Speechless. I’m done with Airbnb. The last time I booked one, the host asked me if his friends who were in town could stay with us 2 days before we arrived. Then this. 
It almost feels like they’re messing with us at this point

Edit: I realize this is normal in other countries but this Airbnb is in Los Angeles USA. This is NOT a thing here.

Airbnb,Never again using Airbnb,"My parter and I recently booked a 3 night stay in Italy using Airbnb. Check in was at 1, so we messaged the host at 11 asking for check in instructions. 1 rolls around and we are waiting at a near by cafe with our luggage waiting for a response. After another hour or so of waiting we start calling air bnb. We are incredibly upset, having missed a booked activity due to not being able to drop off our stuff. We eventually ask the cafe if we can leave our luggage so we can walk into town. AirBnb says they will try contacting the host after 2 hours. They never call us back, we continuously have to call and check in.

SIX HOURS after check in time we are told that the “host” (and by that we find out they mean rental property company) sent us a WhatsApp message before checkin to verify our passports. We do not use WhatsApp as we are American. They did not call, send a message through the app, or text. We’ve traveled abroad dozens of times without WhatsApp (which we would have happily downloaded if they had told us that would be the use of communication)

One third of our vacation in Italy was dedicated to this mess. We missed reservations and spent the afternoon trying to find a backup hotel. 

We will never use this service again.

Edit: 
1.we had messaged the host several days before and was told we’d get more information at the checkin time. This was told through the app. There was no mention of WhatsApp. 

2. I have 0 issue with using WhatsApp.  If I had been told this would have been the main form of communication that would have been fine. However it was not stated at all in the listing. Also maybe I’m WhatsApp dumb but wouldn’t their number work when not called through the app? Very confused why we had to message them but couldn’t call? We tried calling probably 10 times and no one picked up. 

3. I’m an avid traveler. Been to over 30 countries and I’ve never run into this. I’ve had WhatsApp before but due to a lack of using it consistently it was not still active on my phone. Are there any other apps I should be aware of and have ready before traveling?

4. I’m sorry if you found this post annoying. I guess the lesson here is always have WhatsApp.

Final edit:
- I’m sorry I offended anyone saying as an American I don’t use WhatsApp. Obviously some Americans use it. However it is not the norm for communication like it is in Europe. I thought this was obvious. I would not expect someone I didn’t know to try to contact me through an app.

- also I get it, saying I’ll never use AirBnb again seems harsh but honestly I just don’t think it’s worth the hassle and extra fees. Hotels are about the same price and provide more security. I’m sure there are great hosts out there, i hope you continue to do well!",1742,482,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/146nl5s/never_again_using_airbnb/,2023-06-11 07:34:09,Airbnb
Airbnb,Why I will never use Airbnb again…,"My husband, mom, me our two dogs booked a week long stay as we were coming town for my uncles celebration of life. Obviously with two dogs an Airbnb is much more ideal than a hotel. 

The home had 8 reviews, a 4.38 rating. 

We paid a total of $2395 for a 1 week stay. 

We arrived to the home to find the weeds were two feet tall, junk was laying around in the yard, and the house clearly needed some love (front porch was rotting). I figured oh well, not ideal but whatever. We open the door and are immediately greeted by an overwhelming smell of urine. After looking around the house, it is clear the smell is coming from a small room that has no furniture. The door is closed. The room houses the router and WiFi stuff. We also notice the smoke detectors have been cut off, and the back sliding door has no lock. It had a latch, but there was nothing for the door to latch into. There was an old dilapidated short piece of wood being used as a “lock” in the bottom of the door track. 

I immediately called Airbnb and said since of course we cannot stay here, we would like a refund or to be put in a comparable home. They said well first you need to try to work it out with the host. 

Contacted the host, he said the house was cleaned yesterday, there is no smell, etc. The house WAS Cleaned. There were still fresh vacuum marks on the carpet. However, it is clear the urine had soaked to the baseboard given the smell. After going back and forth, the host stated it’s a nice house, and he paid 1.2 million for it….cool, idgaf if you paid 10 million, the house is a shit hole. The host also said he cut the smoke detectors bc they were beeping bc the batteries needed to be replaced…..

We end up booking two hotel rooms. We did not stay in the house for more than 30 minutes. 

Airbnb ends up offering us a $75 refund. 

I eventually reached out to Airbnb’s CEO, VP of Community Support, and several other executives. I asked for a full refund. 

We were then connected with the executive resolution team. After 5 days of back and forth, we we’re refunded $1700. Not the whole amount, but I feel like that’s all we will get. 

Absolutely unbelievable that it was this hard to get a refund (and not a full one!).  

So, TLDR: House reeked of urine, was unsafe to stay in due to cut smoke detectors and a non locking back door. After reaching out to the exec team we got back $1700 of our $2395. I will never book an Airbnb again.

Airbnb,"AirBnB left my family with no place to sleep, one hour before arrival","Yesterday, I was going on vacation with my family (me, my wife, my two year old daughter, and my 9 month old baby). We received an email two days ago that our AirBnB that we were staying at was ready for us to come stay. The location of our family vacation is a 6 hour drive away from where we live. One hour before we arrive (after 5 hours of driving with two small children) we texted our host for the code to the AirBnB. She replied with the code at first, but then she called shortly thereafter to inform us that she had sold the property we were to stay at in February (we booked it Jan 7th) and that AirBnB should have canceled everything. The town we were going to stay in is small and has a big event, so there is literally no other options with AirBnB, Hotels, or any other hosting sites. After fighting with AirBnB for them to make any sort of effort to fix the problem, they just refunded our original payment and left us with no options. We had to turn around and go home! We canceled our entire family vacation! Who will pay for the 150 dollars of gas spent? Who will refund us for activities that we already paid for and can't be refunded? Who will reimburse me for my 3 days of non-refundable PTO I used? Who will help me explain to my 2 year old that the vacation she was so excited for is canceled because AirBnB didn't do their job, didn't cancel as they should have, and left us with absolutely no options?

Airbnb,AC only above 75 degrees allowed at my Airbnb,"I just booked a long stay at an airbnb in the US, but there is no cancelation option. Before I booked the house rules in the listing were pretty basic. After booking, I received a ""house manual"" in addition to the house rules I had already read before booking. 
The house manual says that the air conditioner must be kept above 75, which hardly seems like providing the amenity. It also includes using only specific name brand cleaning products/personal hygiene items that are much more expensive than what I usually buy, among other new rules.
Shouldn't these kind of things been disclosed BEFORE booking? How do I prevent this in the future? I usually message the host a couple of basic questions before booking to make sure it's a good fit, but I'm not sure how to throw possible question darts to sus these things out without sounding like I'm a high maintenance weirdo.


Edits: 
I'm not saying 75 is always unreasonable (although it certainly can be in the humid environment we're staying in). I'm bothered that it wasn't disclosed before booking in the house rules. For those asking it is central air/refrigerated air, not a swamp cooler.

Other things that were disclosed after booking were only buying and using a particular tp brand that is about 3 times the price of Charmin and having to refill things we use like the salt and pepper when we check out even though they were included as amenities.

Airbnb,AirBnB has become absolute garbage,"As a guest, I’ve had several lackluster experiences that makes me never want to go back to STRs. My findings:

* Most hosts are lazy, greedy or some combination of both. If you want to charge a huge daily rate, your property better be impeccable. The reality is that the majority of hosts want a money printer as opposed to a hospitality job, forgetting what they signed up for. Take care of your shit and put in maximum effort, or don’t do it at all.

* Everyone is a “superhost”. I’ve stayed with a few. It means jack shit. One of the properties was missing every television in their property.  No explanation from the host, no warning. People’s response to this is “fight for a refund”. But  as a guest, I don’t want to. I’m on fucking vacation. The absolute last thing I want to do is deal with shit like that, that’s what I’m trying to get away from. Ratings have become inflated just like in ridesharing and they mean nothing.

* Things aren’t trending in the right direction. More people are trying to join late to capitalize on the “easy money” of STRs which only propagate these issues further.

* The only scenario that still makes sense for STRs is large parties. That’s it. I could never recommend an Airbnb to a family of say 2-4 because the service will likely be shit and it’ll be as expensive as a hotel with 20% the convenience.

I truly feel bad for the good and honest hosts out there, because they’re becoming a rarity it seems. And the get-rich-quick types are ruining it for everyone else. I just hope once the house of cards collapses that they survive and help return Airbnb to its glory days.",1288,596,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/v0b5at/airbnb_has_become_absolute_garbage/,2022-05-29 13:25:28,Airbnb
Airbnb,Three strikes with Airbnb will never book again. Host wants my credit card and signed rental agreement,"I booked a very scenic place months ago and less than 3 weeks during peak summer season the host cancelled claiming septic issues.  Then AirBnb offered a palsy amount for a coupon to rebook. I said really you can do better.  They raised to approximately one nights rental (not including tax and fees).

So I rebook another place in a different city.  The host then requests my credit card info and asks me to sign a rental agreement, giving them the rights to charge additional fees.   This just seemed very sketchy, so I call Airbnbnb to cancel and to get my coupon back.    I wait for hours for them to call back.  Meanwhile time is ticking and I have nowhere to go on my summer vacation.   I cannot rebook another place for the same days so I quit waiting and cancelled the booking myself.

I call Airbnb they said they cannot give me back the coupon because I cancelled the 2nd reservation!!  I felt like I was talking to some offshore support center, due to their accents and broken English.

Never mind that the coupon was to compensate for the host cancelling the orginal booking and I was cancelling the second due to sketchy request for my credit card and rental agreement.

I will NEVER book on Airbnb again.  I have spent all morning dealing with finding another place from slim pickings this late in the year.

Airbnb,Hello. This is your AirBnB cleaner here.,"I clean about 25 units in Panama City Beach, FL, everything from high end super fancy to could use some renovations. I want to talk to you about cleaning fees, why you pay them and what we really expect you to do before you leave.

My fees are as follows-
1br- $125
2br- $175
3br- $225
4br+ by quote

So, let’s talk about where that money goes. We supply your starter items (trash bags, dish soap and sponge, laundry and dishwasher detergents, toilet paper, shower kits) which probably run about $5 per unit. I pay my helper $50 for 1/2br. My supplies per unit run about $5 as well. Laundry for a 1br is $10. My gas and business insurance maybe $5. Thats $70 for a 1br. I myself make $55 cleaning that unit. It’s takes the two of us 1.5 hrs to do a 1br if we aren’t rushing like crazy. That’s a pretty good salary, but I’m certainly not getting rich. And when you walk in my units I guarantee you are impressed with the cleanliness.

I know so many units aren’t being cleaned to my standards so it might not seem worth it to you, but I want you to understand why the cost is what it is. This really can only apply to units that are truly being cleaned. 

Now, here’s what we really want you to do before you leave. Start the dishwasher at least an hour or two before check out time and throw away your open food items. It would be great if you took the trash out on your way out.. but that’s not the end of the world. Mostly the dishwasher please!! The rest is really no big deal. The owners may have a list, but it’s not like I’m complaining that you didn’t strip the beds. 

The BIGGEST thing I would ask is of pet owners. Please please please don’t let your dogs on the furniture! Please! It takes forever to get the hair off of the sofa and we have to lint roll sheets and and blankets AFTER washing. I love dogs, I have two German Shepherds, so I know the struggle.. but we WILL hit you with excessive cleaning fees for that.

The main thing we ask is not to be assholes. Just don’t leave the place disgusting and we’ll do the rest! I take a lot of pride in my units and I want them to be beautiful for you. I want you to enjoy your time there and not worry about much at all.

Ok, so now.. what would you tell me if you could.. which you can! How do you think cleaners could do better and make the fee worth it?

Next post.. I’m going to tell you all the shocking things most cleaners ARE NOT doing.. stick around. 😭 And if you want a great place to stay at a beautiful beach, let me know, I’ll hook you up with some of the best owners on AirBnB.

EDIT- My goodness. I’ve seen so many complaints about cleaning before check out so I come to tell you that we really don’t expect it, don’t worry. And that pisses you off too. Some of you just want to complain. You don’t want to fix the situation, you just want to complain about it. I don’t get to talk with guests, so this was my opportunity to discuss with you. It wasn’t some kind of attack, it wasn’t meant to try and make you better guests.. it was just a chance for a dialogue. I thought it would be interesting to have a conversation with the guests.",539,675,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/13vf989/hello_this_is_your_airbnb_cleaner_here/,2023-05-30 03:30:33,Airbnb
Airbnb,HELP. Someone is using my address to scam strangers on AirBnB,"There has recently been 2 separate attempts for people to enter my home thinking they are checking into the AirBnB they booked. My home is not an AirBnB nor have I ever used AirBnB.

The first time it happened they woke me up in the middle of the night and I thought I was being woken up to an attempted home invasion. It was terrifying. After they gave up and left I learned they were attempting to check in to the AirBnB they booked and had no idea they were doing anything wrong. 

I searched and in a matter of minutes I found the AirBnB listing. I reported the host and cohost multiple times. Reached out to AirBnB multiple times and they said they would look into getting this resolved-meaning removing the listing.

It happened again a few hours ago. Another attempt was made to enter my home. The listing is still there. I reached out to local law enforcement to file a police report. They pretty much told me there isn’t much they can do for me on their end, to keep all my doors locked at all times, and that eventually AirBnB will issue enough refunds over this property that they will take notice and remove it-but that could be weeks.

Evicted From Airbnb At Midnight Before Family Funeral After Refusing $5,000 Extortion
by Gary Leff on June 29, 2023

Airbnb can be a risk. There are too many scams on the platform, and the company has a history of not standing behind guests that find themselves stranded without a place to stay – or hosts whose properties are poorly treated.

But the platform that connects people who want to rent their real estate, and guests looking for a place to stay (at a hefty fee to both parties), has a real place.

Destinations without good hotel options. I’ve used them on the Texas Gulf Coast, Martha’s Vineyard, and parts of Australia’s Gold Coast for instance.
Larger accommodations, where multiple families or large families might want to stay together and over longer periods of time with residential-style amenities.
Sure, cleaning fees that still leave you with a chore list of cleaning to do before departure gets most of the bad press. But here’s a shocking case where guests were really at the mercy of a property owner that treated them badly – with Airbnb nowhere to be found.

A senior citizen – an Airbnb Superhost himself – booked a house for 8 siblings to stay in for their brother’s funeral. A total of 5 of them actually stayed at the property. Over the course of the week several people came over to pay condolences and care for the family.

Properties may have maximum guest numbers to comply with local ordinances, or additional charges for larger number of guests to discourage parties and damage. Though only 5 people spent the night at the property,

The Airbnb host watched them on camera and saw visitors come over then demanded they pay $5,000 additional dollars as though more people than registered were staying and threatened to kick them out if they refused.

Airbnb contacted the 70 year old man to demand the additional payment. The host claimed the seniors “caused community disturbance.” Before the funeral they were evicted “at midnight, with their suitcases, grocery bags & nowhere to go.” At 2 a.m. before the funeral, with the help of family members, they found a budget hotel to move to. The guest was blocked from the platform as a host, so that he couldn’t manage his rental properties either.

The homesharing platform became responsive – only after the man’s son, a lawyer, had his tweets about the incident go viral.

To be sure, outlier events happen in hotels, you’re never fully protected anywhere you go. But there’s a company to go after when staying with a chain, and if nothing else tort liability helps align incentives. To date that hasn’t seemed to be the case with Airbnb.",1226,147,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/14mkqyv/5_seniors_evicted_from_airbnb_at_midnight_before/,2023-06-30 00:00:55,Airbnb
Airbnb,AirBnB now banning interior cameras in all properties [USA],"Article here: https://www.wired.com/story/airbnb-indoor-security-camera-ban/ 

Airbnb will soon ban hosts from watching their guests with indoor security cameras, as the company is reversing course on its surveillance policies.

As of April 30, hosts around the world must remove indoor cameras and disclose other outdoor monitoring tech to guests before they book. Airbnb previously allowed hosts to install security cameras in common areas of a home, like hallways and living rooms. But it also required hosts to disclose them, make them clearly visible, and keep the cameras out of places like sleeping areas and bathrooms.

Still, the cameras have been an issue. Guests have reported encountering hidden cameras in their short-term rentals. For hosts, the cameras can be a way to discourage guests from throwing large parties or to stop the gatherings before they become too disruptive. It’s a big enough concern that several companies have started making noise monitoring tech, billing themselves as solutions to protect short-term rentals.

But guests see them as an invasion of privacy—a watching eye intruding on their vacation.

“We're really grateful that Airbnb listened to those of us pushing back and calling for them to actually put safety and privacy first,” says Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, a pro-privacy organization.

In its announcement, Airbnb said that the majority of its listings do not mention a security camera, so the rule change may not affect most listings. Vrbo, another short-term rental platform, already banned the use of visual and audio surveillance inside of properties.

Airbnb says it will investigate reported violations of the rule, and may penalize violators by removing their listings or accounts. But this policy may struggle to address the camera problem at large, as the company has already required hosts to disclose the indoor cameras, and guests have sometimes reported hidden and undisclosed cameras.

The new rules also require hosts to disclose to guests whether they are using noise decibel monitors or outdoor cameras before guests book. Both are used by some hosts to monitor properties for parties, which have continued to bring noise, damage, and danger even after Airbnb instituted a party ban and employed new anti-party tech to try to prevent revelers from booking on its site. Airbnb will also prohibit hosts from using outdoor cameras to monitor indoor spaces, and bars them from “certain outdoor areas where there’s a greater expectation of privacy,” such as outdoor showers and saunas, it says.

“This just emphasizes the fact that surveillance always gives a huge amount of power to whoever controls the camera system,” says Fox Cahn. “When it's used in a property you're renting, whether it's a landlord or an Airbnb, it's ripe for abuse.”",302,298,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1bc7hsa/airbnb_now_banning_interior_cameras_in_all/,2024-03-11 16:35:27,Airbnb
Airbnb,AirBnB host says there was a “glitch” in the price and I owe her more money,"Hey everyone,

I travel for work and yesterday I booked a four month longterm AirBnB across the country. It was a little pricey for the area but the house was really nice so I put down the first month’s payment which is about $3,500. The AirBnB host messaged me soon after saying that there is a glitch in the AirBnB system and the price is actually about $5,000 so I need to send them more money. Reeking of BS I refused and tried to cancel my booking to get a refund, but AirBnB is saying there is an error and the refund due is $0.00. I contacted the host asking if they can cancel my booking so I can get a refund and they refused stating that there are no refunds or cancellations and I need to negotiate for a better price if I can’t pay the $5,000 a month fee. I’ve never had this problem before with AirBnB where it wouldn’t let me cancel or get a refund, I booked for mid July through October so I know I should be able to cancel. Does anyone have any experience with this? Do I need to get the host to cancel for me to get a refund?

EDIT: Thank you all for the information. Just to clarify I did not cancel, but am asking the host to. Sadly the host has not responded to my message after I rejected their proposal to negotiate and to cancel our booking. So following everyone’s advice if they do not cancel I will happily move in to their place for a few months.

Airbnb,BOOKING FROM HELL! Apt got eviction notice during my stay. Need help fighting Airbnb,"I’m so furious with Airbnb for ruining my vacation and I need help because they are denying my refund. I need all the twitter hashtags and ideas of which consumer advocates to report this to. 

I booked a 7 night stay in Los Angeles (ok, it was Marina del Rey). I was traveling with my husband, and our two young kids which included our 1 year old baby.

Two nights into our stay, we returned to the apartment in the afternoon to find an eviction notice on the door from the property management. The eviction was for multiple months of unpaid rent. The notice clearly states that if the rent wasn’t paid back plus extra fees within 3 days, the property management would seize possession of the premises. And we had 5 more nights that we had already paid for. 

I called Airbnb immediately and told them I felt UNSAFE and that our stay was no longer secure. I only asked to be rebooked immediately elsewhere to a similar property in the area. I had concerns if the host would barge in and start removing her things from the apartment, harass us or what she was capable after this notice. An eviction letter is not a first time warning so obviously this was a long standing problem. 

Airbnb gave me 2 options. A) Contact the host and have her release us from booking. Spoiler alert: she didn’t and I knew she wouldn’t. It wouldn’t be in her favor to do so financially.  Or B ) Trust the host if she said that she resolved it with the apartment management. The host said all was resolved but did not provide proof it. There’s no way I could trust someone who was accepting Airbnb bookings if they didn’t pay the rent. And as a 3rd party, the apartment management has no obligation to tell me if she paid. What if we stayed, rent was not back paid and the apartment management locked the apartment or confiscated the things we had (luggage/passports etc), what rights would we have? 

So I stayed up until 5 am, desperately trying to escalate this with Airbnb, asking to speak to a supervisor, getting absolutely nowhere with them and simultaneously trying to find another place to stay right away. I could only connect to call centers outside the US, where their reps only read from a script and were devoid of any urgency or incentive to help. 

And Airbnb had the audacity to say if we vacated early, that we would be held to the cancellation policy which meant no refund. I asked how that was possible to ask us to stay when there was a 3 day timeline for the eviction and we had 5 more nights? Crickets. 

In the end, we quickly left to a hotel and I contacted my credit card for a fraud dispute. I also emailed the apartment management, sent them the Airbnb link and asked if the tenant (aka the host) was allowed to sublet to Airbnb. They replied that absolutely not, the lease prohibits any subletting. 

I wrote a negative review of our stay, cited the eviction debacle and the host replied that the apartment management never informed her of any problems! Obviously a lie because our messaging within the Airbnb app included her 
saying that she was emailed the eviction notice. 

Despite all the documentation,  MY CREDIT CARD DENIED THE REFUND AND SAID I MUST ADHERE TO AIRBNB’S CANCELLATION POLICY !!

I’ve had my credit card re-escalate the dispute. But I need all the best twitter advice to shame  them. And any consumer protection advice. I plan on notifying the Better Business Bureau at a minimum. 

If you’d made it this far, thank you!

Airbnb,I see why people are leaving Airbnb,"I’m understand hosts need to protect themselves and property but at this point I would never use Airbnb to book travel again as a former host. The charges are outrageous & the rules are beyond ridiculous. I get it, we want our properties left in good condition but charged for every single thing becomes a bit much. Charging for every towel, for every wash cloth, every piece of debris, just everything…. I’d rather just book a hotel. I booked an Airbnb for this weekend and after all of the fees, rules sent after the fact in their welcome message with fees associated, pet fees, and everything else under the Sun I literally could book a stay at a 4-5 star hotel in the same area with less trouble. Yes, I get more space with an Airbnb but for me, it’s just my partner and I…. I absolutely don’t see the point in spending so much with so much hassle when I can just go to the hotel….

Airbnb,"AirBnB hosts, please read and understand the law on service animals. It’s exhausting. [US]","Edit for clarity: I’m specifically referring to US Airbnb accommodations, and I ONLY book the entire place, no shared spaces when I travel. 

If every airbnb host followed the law and didn’t discriminate against service animals, I would be writing this post from a cute apartment by the river. I would not be writing this post honestly. However, I’m writing this post from my home instead.

Background: I have a service dog, an adult German shepherd male. Absolute rock star of an animal from a great organization in North Carolina. I planned to travel to West Virginia with my partner for the 4th of July holiday and attend an event. Because we’ve had a previously bad experience with hosts balking at my service dog, I made sure my partner got a “pet friendly” place to avoid the nonsense. Before driving the 4+ hours up there, the host messaged him and asked what kind of dog we had because a bigger dog probably wouldn’t work well in the small apartment (not at all mentioned in the house rules, and wow did they have some specific rules lol). My partner reiterated that this was my service dog, but let them know he was a German shepherd. The host cancelled the reservation less than 30 mins later. Of course he let airbnb know, etc etc. and they did their host education whatever.

But it’s exhausting to constantly be on edge, waiting for someone to have a hair up their butt  and derail my entire trip. Heck, I’ve been abandoned in the city at night in the cold because my Lyft driver decided that he didn’t want a dog in the car despite stating he knew he couldn’t refuse and didn’t care. Several other situations have occurred, so I just don’t use ride sharing apps anymore. Airbnb has proved to be just as stressful.

You cannot deny a guest because they have a service animal (even for allergies, fear of dogs, etc.). I think there’s a process for an exception on AirBnB for allergies but I don’t have the details on that.

You cannot change a pet fee or additional cleaning for fur or whatnot just for the dog being there. This doesn’t apply to extra cleaning or damage caused by the dog actually doing something like chewing up the furniture or pooping on the rug (those are fair game).

Technically a guest doesn’t have to disclose their service animal at booking either. There is no “ID” or “certificate” a service dog needs to be accepted, though if I’m flying I’ll keep the DOT form on me.

Emotional support animals are not the same as a trained service dog and do not count here. “Emotional support” and “companionship” are not tasks. 

I totally understand people are jaded because they either don’t understand or they’ve experienced fakes or whatever. However, imagine declining or cancelling a booking because your guest uses a cane or an oxygen tank. That’s essentially what you’re doing here.

Please understand that these dogs are our lifelines, and traveling while disabled is already stressful enough. Don’t make it worse. ",98,262,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1dx96z7/airbnb_hosts_please_read_and_understand_the_law/,2024-07-07 05:34:37,Airbnb

Airbnb,Ive left my airbnb the worst they have seen it in their history of hosting [SPAIN],"Id like to think im very respectful of peoples home. But i do not sweep or mop when i leave. You dont mop the floors after eating at a restaurant do you?

So im a little confused by our negative review that i left a few strands of hair in the shower. (Yes, i have hair) 

I didnt fold up the clothesline back in the cupboard after use. (Yes, i admit i forgot).

I left an empty pizza box out. (The bin was too small and no other bins were on the property, so i put it on bench next to the bin, im confused should guests without vehicles be taking empty pizza boxes with them).

I didnt clean their pans well enough. (The pans were extremely disgusting prior to our stay with layers of burnt grime, we spent a long time scrubbing the crap out to toast some bread. It was in fact left in better condition than when we arrived.

I left a roll of toilet paper behind on the beside table. (I carry toilet paper because public bathrooms here sometimes dont have any, i simply forgot, free toilet paper for you?) 

All these 5 points he summarised with that hes never seen the property left in such disgusting filth in his years of hosting and that he would never recommend me to anyone.

Im a little confused i didnt know it was such a crime to do these things in airbnbs. Sometimes guests are rushing to check out, and a few things get missed. Im quite offended by this and reluctant to use airbnbs again if im expected to be cleaning bathrooms and kitchens, carrying all our rubbish with us, making sure every item we touch is in its exact place.

Airbnb,Kicked Out of AirBnB for Having One Guest Over for Lunch [Colombia],"I cannot express in words just how much I despise AirBnB! I had a week-long reservation for a ""whole apartment"", but it was canceled and I got kicked out for having \*one\* friend over for lunch before we went out together (we weren't even loud!). The host found out because one of the front desk security guards notified her, and she called support.

Airbnb,Airbnb is not for me anymore,"I've stayed in multiple airbnbs since 2016 and I really loved how it used to be cheaper than hotels with some nice amenities like a kitchen and washer&dryer. Recently I feel like it's gotten so burdensome.

Here's my venting list. Agree or disagree, I don't really care. It's the things that bother me. And yes, I will go back to hotels.

- Not suitable for introverts. Some hosts are super adamant about communication that goes beyond necessity. Even for self check-in bookings. I'm not here to chat, I'm here to sleep. They expect to communicate thoughout whole stay, and even before check-in. Hotels only need at check-in/check-out.
- House manual. Imagine having to follow rules like a toddler for a place you paid $$$$ to stay. Some listings don't even include it online and only show it at the property. So no documentation for guests to use as evidence and basically you're screwed if you find a ridiculous rule.
- Cleaning fees. Either charge cleaning fees and do everything or don't charge so much if you make the guest  clean up and throw the garbage out. We're basically paying them to let us clean their place. What a joke.
- The review system is kinda rigged. People feel inclined to give ""positive"" reviews. It lacks of objective honesty and if you are, there's biteback from the hosts.
- Airbnb Listings making themselves pretty like Tinder. Some descriptions are vague or they use photos from like 2-3 years ago when it was still new. There's no other source besides what they give you.
- Strict cancellations. Hotels have better flexibility for changing around. I screwed myself a few times when I wasn't careful, but it wouldn't have been an issue if I had booked with a hotel.

Having gone through so many airbnbs, I even have a checklist for selecting my bookings. I take these additional steps so I know it fit my needs but the checklist has been growing and it's becoming a serious hassle. Airbnb is not worth the price/value anymore for me.

Rant over.

Airbnb,"After 2 years of multiple people from this sub having terrible experiences with an Airbnb host, host will be exposed on the news in July.","Thanks to this sub and the online community, after 2 years of persistence, a major news channel will be doing an expose on a corporate Airbnb host that MANY people have had bad experiences with. 

The host goes by Luxsle Corp. Many people on [Yelp](https://s.yelp.com/esawBrEkp5) and on this sub have reported poor experiences with Luxsle. 

When those people voiced their reviews online, many received legal threats from Luxsle over their reviews. This is my main point of contention, and the exact problem I wanted to address. 

I was one of those people who was threatened with legal action.  I didn’t back down, because I cannot stand watching someone or some company bully consumers into a corner. 

The thing is, I work IN THE BUSINESS of consumer reviews…so I know a thing or two about consumer rights. So when Luxsle sent me a legal threat…I knew what to do…work with special investigators from the Attorney General, BBB, and the media. 

With that said, next month, a major news network channel will be doing an expose about Luxsle Corp, in July 2023. 

I will follow up with the date, time, and channel, once I can disclose those details.  For those who don’t have a way to watch on television, I will share a link to the expose online. 

For those unfamiliar with the discussion history there has been about Luxsle on this sub, here is a non-exhaustive list of threads related to the Airbnb host:

Airbnb,Never using Airbnb again. Deactivating account.,"I booked an airbnb for 2 months and it got cancelled after 1.5 months staying there. Had to book another reservation. Which was $500 more than the refund amount. The first airbnb decided I pay for “damages” (unexpected cleaning from garbage being left after rushing to leave the property) and that was a $700 tab. End of the second reservation comes along and the host decides to have me pay for scratches on the floor that was not caused by me (house was filthy, nothing like pictures and already had holes in the walls) and pay for missing items that were returned. This was a $1000 tab. Airbnb Support has done nothing to help me out and are refusing to respond to any of my messages after the fact that they charged my credit card without choice.

Airbnb,My Airbnb lost electricity and water for 3 days during our stay. They're only refunding me 30% of the affected nights. Am I wrong for expecting more? [USA],"Title explains it all. A natural disaster caused our Airbnb to lose access to electricity and water for 3 nights during a 7 night sta,, it ruined several hundred dollars worth of food, and several members of our party cancelled on the trip.

It happened during the last 3 days of our stay, and the utility companies sort of dragged us along about when repairs would be coming. If it had happened earlier, we would've opted to cancel the entire trip.

I asked that Airbnb refund the nights affected (about $1300ish), because without electricity, Internet, running water, bathrooms, etc - the entire property was unusable aside from the beds we slept in. This is a lake front property in the middle of nowhere, so we were pretty stranded. We had to cart water in coolers from a nearby lake to fill toilet bowls.The owner of the property did not help at all with getting the utilities back online, or even provide us with drinking water.

I spent around 4k on this trip, and Airbnb refunded me $350ish. Airbnb has 30% refund policy (for nights affected only) and just sorta leave it up to the owners of they think we should get a better refund 

I am feeling conflicted because I really enjoyed the property, and don't want to leave a bad review but feel compelled to based on how all of this was handled. A vacation I had planned and looked forward to all year was mostly ruined, and the 9 other adults I had with us feel the same way.

Does Airbnb have other refund policies? Am I being a Karen for feeling like we deserve a better refund?",67,149,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1es3cxw/my_airbnb_lost_electricity_and_water_for_3_days/,2024-08-14 14:41:16,Airbnb
Airbnb,"Airbnb hosts, should have to include “cleaning fee” in amount per night advertised. [USA] (and everywhere)","I started using Airbnb back around 2016.  Back then it was actually amazing, and worth it.  You could find great spots for super cheep.  It beat hotels price wise every time, and you got a cool experience.

Nowadays, Airbnbs are everywhere and people charge laughable fees.. not to mention nickel and dime you on everything.  

I was literally just looking for an Airbnb, for two nights, in a mid sized city.  One place advertised $77 per night.  Looks nice, cool.. let’s start booking.  $80 dollar cleaning fee!  ..EIGHTY!   Airbnb “service fee”.  Whatever that means (gotta keep the shareholder happy), and taxes $12.   So $77 ($154 for two)  per night, comes out to $278 for two nights.  What?!

This is such a bait and switch.  It’s not $77 per night, it’s actually $138 per night.  At that rate, you could literally rent a hotel.  (And not have to clean up after yourself, making the place spotless, for fear of being charged for additional “cleaning”.

Airbnb,I’ve only had great experience with AirBnB as a guest since implementing these iron rules:,"- Only book “entire place”
- Only book properties with 4.9 stars or higher
- With at least 5 reviews
- Search for the following keywords in the reviews: issue, problem, noise, quiet, dirty, smell, charge, accurate
- Read the fine print
- Look up the approximate property location on Google Maps

Mindset:
- Essentially I treat AirBnB like a used car marketplace. 
- I know there are great hosts, I took precaution to avoid bad ones.
- I don’t try to use AirBnB as a “cheaper hotel room”, but rather to get more amenities or rooms for a group at a similar price.

Just like others, I’ve had horror stories. They tend to happen when these rules are broken. Hope this helps others avoid nightmares. Remember that AirBnB has forced hotels and hostels to up their game on both quality and price - take advantage of those. 🙏

Other pro tips to consider?

Edit: Looks like the keyword search is quite popular. Thanks to those who contributed more keywords:

- Bed
- Bug / roach
- Pet / cat / dog
- Internet / wifi (not always a deal breaker)
- However / but

Edit2: Under the “read the fine print” umbrella, some folks have more specific tips:

- Consider the check-in / check-out shenanigans, if there is a rule that there no late check-ins- hard pass. I can't control what time the plane arrives. if you absolutely have to stay at that AirBnB then we book the first arrival night at the Marriott. (h/t u/kokemill)
- Compare the total charges
- Make sure it’s actually an __entire__ place, not an entire basement, not an entire floor, not an entire room with a separate entrance, etc. Not saying that a shared unit is bad, but some hosts try to game the categorization to distort your search result (h/t u/FuzzyJury)
- Scrutinize photos. Look for photoshops and/or attempt to avoid showing the entire room / unit, such as zoomed pics of randoms like spice rack, pillows, etc (h/t u/cappotto-marrone)
- Make sure there are recent positive reviews (h/t u/Arjen231)
- Read the house rules for any gotcha (h/t u/bkpeach)",450,165,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/12zyuun/ive_only_had_great_experience_with_airbnb_as_a/,2023-04-26 20:33:48,Airbnb
Airbnb,Airbnb experience is no longer reliable[USA]. What's your opinion?,"Airbnb no longer offers a reliable experience for guests. While good properties still exist, there are too many poor properties which are misrepresented and not worth the expense or risk. My observation is during the early years owners took pride in their property and strived to offer a good guest experience. Now properties are too often misrepresented, in poor repair, below standard cleanliness, and sometimes actually dangerous. 

Airbnb doesn't help by not holding hosts to account. Instead, substandard properties remain and grow in the system as Airbnb favors hosts and themselves in disputes. 

I have read that hosts are also dealing with increased guest problems. There are problems on both sides. 

When traveling, most guests need to know that they will get a reliability comfortable and safe place to stay. While I have stayed at some great Airbnb properties in the past, I am finding the reliability deteriorating. That makes Airbnb no longer a viable option for my family.

Airbnb,Help! Airbnb said they would cancel my reservation and give me a refund if I could prove there was a death in my family. Sent them the death certificate and found out they were lying! [USA],"They said there is no cancelation policy, unless we had a death in the family and can send a death certificate. Well UNlucky for us, we are canceling because of a death in the family and we even inappropriately got a death certificate from the grieving mother, but they still denied 100% of our cancelation and refund because the host has no return policy! So they just lie and say they will refund you if there is a death and you prove it with a death certificate assuming most people won't go to the trouble of actually meeting their requirements and then when you do they still deny you!!!

Not only that, But when I was trying to cancel it I looked at the property and actually read some of the 30 reviews and 13 of the 30 reviews mentioned that the place is dirty and old and falling apart and has dirty floors and dirty sheets and they do not clean it properly. It's managed by a vacation rental company called Vacasa that list multiple properties on airbnb, And I saw another review for one of their other rentals from 3 days ago that they said the place was so dirty they didn't feel safe with their children there, so it's not like this was an old problem that they fixed but it's an ongoing problem that they rent places that they do not clean properly.

Even if we didn't have to go to the memorial and could continue on our trip I would not want to stay at this place and I can't believe airbnb allows places to be listed that have over half the reviews saying they are dirty and have dirty floors and sheets and are old and falling apart!!! I honestly think they should have allowed me to cancel just because of that. But for them to tell me That I have to get a death certificate from the grieving mother and sent to them in order to get my refund and then finding out that was a lie and they just said that to try and get me to go away and will not honor their word is extremely upsetting.

Also I don't like that you can't speak to anyone in the United States and that their customer service is hard to understand and it's not their fault but they clearly have no power Uber anything because they told me I would get a refund if I could send a Death Certificate but then I sent the Death Certificate and they say they can't give me a refund because the host has no cancelation policy So There's no one actually running airbnb there are just hosts who do whatever they want and then call center people in India who can't actually help you. I posted it on Instagram and tiktok and apparently a lots of other people have been denied legitimate cancellations, and stayed in dirty disgusting places that airbnb continues to list, it's not just me.

This is basically our second time so Im not very familiar with the rules though I try to educate myself on it as much as I can. With that said, Im pretty sure Im the one at fault here.

I booked a 3 day 2 night stay. Now, this is where I messed up. I saw the rule about needing to put all guests including visitors even if they’re just visiting for 5 minutes AFTER booking. Right away, I messaged the host about it and sent a request to change the number of guests. They said they cant do that anymore and that I have to pay the $300++ fee.

Airbnb,Walked out halfway through my 5 week dream Villa stay. No idea if I'll ever see any refund. Or another Airbnb.,"Death by a million cuts is the best way to describe this and Airbnb support is ridiculously useless.

Want to know why I went from thinking AirBNB is like a life-hack to probably getting banned? Turns out AirBNB is a bad choice for any important trip.

I should have studied Airbnb's overly complicated check-in policies before my arrival to protect myself from THIS. But I made bad assumptions. Assumptions that AirBNB encourages you to make, by the way, considering they prominently say you're protected with guarantees all over their website. I'd laugh if I wasn't still so livid.

It all started because I never should have accepted the slightest change inside the villa from what I expected at check in, no matter how small or fixable.

I was so enamored with the location that I'd searched so hard to find. [Here's the view, see what I mean?](https://imgur.com/a/B9ujX4f). When you arrive from the airport with a half dozen bags and family of 4 in tow including your 9 year old son, you just want to get in the pool. And everyone in my group was already taking selfies and smiling. Let's just get this check-in over with.

The kitchen was pretty filthy. But whatever. We'll be here for a long time and can clean it up quick. And the listing includes 2 professional cleanings a week. (Narrator Voice: The cleaners never come)

There was an unexpected long and steep trail, like about 500’ long, from the villa from the car parking area. But don't worry, the manager lady said, there's a small vehicle that can drive you and all your groceries to the room (ominous foretelling).

Where's the BBQ? I had been dreaming for months about spending the summer here with a beer and grilling burgers. ""Don't worry, we'll bring the bbq tomorrow.""

The ceiling fans aren't working, but again, ""don't worry, our tech will handle it tomorrow.""

I should have called Airbnb immediately and asked for the ""check-in guarantee"". Because now I know this is (probably) the last possible minute that Airbnb gives a rip. Wait until tomorrow and that option is gone and Airbnb will put you on read for the rest of your trip.

That night I slept (poorly) in a 90 degree room. ""Oh sorry, we'll come by the next day to fix the air-conditioning.""

The BBQ arrived 2 days later: [here's the bbq](https://imgur.com/a/4ljnYAn). ""We can't really use this because of the rust, any chance you've got something better?"", I felt dismayed. ""Oh, this is the one everybody uses and never complain before. Sorry"".

Damn. Whatever. We'll work around it. Good attitude. But it's a listed amenity... and I guess this is technically a BBQ.

The next afternoon we go to stock up on groceries, one of those huge shopping trips where you buy 24 pack cases of beers and water and soda, and everything. All together it fills the trunk of the car and half the back seat. It's all dropped off at the lobby by our taxi, but the electric villa car driver downright refuses to help. ""Sorry, you villa no can car"". He doesn't speak much English at all. But he's definitely not going to help. At all. WTF. So one by one we each relay the boxes and bags down the 500 foot trail.

A few days later, a few more ""tech support"" calls for outlets not working, the microwave not working, light bulbs going out all over the place, eventually I thought the move in pains would be done for. 

Now it's time to relax and recharge. 

Then the gorgeous infinity pool started to turn [green and slimy](https://imgur.com/a/oN6U87l). ""No, can't be, our pool guy comes by twice a week"" they said. I sent the manager [underwater video showing the murky view](https://i.imgur.com/9j3uqiU.mp4) from my GoPro. ""OMG"" was the reply. ""I'll check with the pool guy"". A few days later he arrives. It took a week before the pool was clear again.

I was starting to despair a little by this point. So. Many. Problems. But they eventually got mostly fixed (kinda) after a day or two. It felt like I was a guinea pig. Like I was the project manager dealing with a punch list. It felt like they must think I'm the most complaining guy ever. But I also felt that if I didn't stay on top of it, they'd leave and never return.

Then the bomb dropped, or I should say was just about to drop, 20 days in. Based on the AirBNB listing I had agreed to pay utilities - an amount roughly equal to $3 per cubic meter of water. My total should be like... $30 for the whole trip. Oh, also, I was required to give $600 cash deposit at check in. 

I know, I know. Airbnb says to [not deal with money outside the platform](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/140/security-deposits). But according to this page:

""There is one exception: Hosts who manage their listings with API-connected software can set a security deposit using our offline fees feature outside of Airbnb.” 

How would I know? It was suspicious to me. I also found this [other article on Airbnb](https://i.imgur.com/LVuq7rs.png) that reassured me. I asked the host about it. He mentioned the deposit in his listing. He says they are a hotel and real business with receipts and everything. Surely AirBNB knows he's asking on his listing as they approved it (right???).

So by this time, it occurred to me to check on the utility meters and I was STUNNED to discover that we'd already consumed a volume equivalent to about three 20' sea shipping containers. 100 cubic meters. In 20 days, with 4 people. Impossible. That is like 4 entire swimming pools.

The host agrees, ""seems high"". ""Ok great"", I said, ""let's get on the same page, how are you going to charge water now?"". ""According to the meter"". Ummm. How's that going to work? ""Don't worry, you won't have to pay for the leak, just according to the meter"". Come on man. Figure this out. ""Dude, that makes no sense. Why don't we agree on some average family usage now, so that when I'm checking out we don't have a big miscommunication"". 

I even googled for average household water consumption in various regions of the world to get an estimate. (It's about 25-50 cubic meters a YEAR per person, if you wondered). I shared my newfound knowledge with the host.

""No, we won't discuss until checkout.""

""???""

""No, we won't discuss until checkout.""

Shit. Now at this point I'm getting red hot under the collar. This is red flag galore time. I'm never going to see my deposit again. I'm going to be extorted by a $1000 water bill an hour before my flight out of here and the police are going to have to come. We need to decide how to fix this now.

So we're getting nowhere. This guy becomes obstinate. He absolutely refuses to name a total. He absolutely refuses to say how he'll calculate it later. But somehow on our day of checking out, he'll know.

Days of this are going goes by and now I'm losing sleep. The water meter is spinning wildly when everything inside the house is turned off. Like, seriously feeling stressed and anxious about this whole situation. The ""I'm getting cheated alarm"" is going off in my mind. I'm even documenting the meter hour by hour to see how much is getting lost.

I start looking for other signs of cheating. Hey, where's the cleaner who's supposed to be here twice a week? They haven't come yet. I ask and of course he says ""that was for pre-covid rates, now we don't do it because your price is too low, sorry.""

But it's in your listing! 

""Sorry, have a nice day"" is the response.

We mention the water leak to the girl in the lobby. ""Oh, you should meet the HOA president, he knows about this.""

So we learned that the owner of our villa owes the HOA like $75k in past due bills. There was a surprise huge water bill last month, which they didn't pay. Their villa is an illegal AirBNB he thinks with no proper registration. The HOA has to tell guests of our villa all the time they don't get to use the community resources like the gym (which was also in the listing of course).

I ask Airbnb for help. A bit desperately. If you've ever done the same, maybe you have an idea what happens next. A full day passes before the first reply. Then 5 minutes later that guy's shift ends and he hands the ticket it to another customer service rep who promptly marked it closed. Then another full day passes. I ask for help more urgently. I submit everything I have. 

I get a copy/paste reply. It seems like they are trying to discuss with the host behind the scenes. I reply instantly for clarification. More copy/paste hell responses. Another day goes by. I get a message from AirBNB that says the host promised them he won't cheat us about the water. So we can relax now. 

I explain again about the amenities just discovered and missing. The burned out lights over the stairs safety problem. The disaster that's unfolding. He's already cheating me. I feel like almost daily I'm ""reporting"" a new amenities issue or safety issue with AirBnB. The worst feeling.

The next reply from AirBnBis basically sorry, this isn't something we can help with. We recommend you use the ""ask for money"" feature and see if the host will refund you.

I decided to sleep on it. Maybe I can just chill. Meditate for an hour. Find more zen here, which is why I came. But I wake at 4 am and can't sleep anymore. I sit on the deck and drink my coffee while looking towards the dark sea and morning stars. Damn, [the view](https://imgur.com/a/s93ApYQ) here is so good. But why does this cause so much stress. This isn't why I'm here. My life is too short for this. I need close this and mentally move on.

Then an idea comes to me. I'm just going to leave. Fuck these fucks for ruining my time.

My wife wakes a few hours later and I tell her my plan: book another place today. Go. Fight more on Airbnb if we can. If they give us the runaround, charge back the whole thing with my bank. My credit card company will look at it as service not as described, I think. I have a fuck ton of chat messages and pictures showing I'm not getting what I paid for. AirBNB can fight this chargeback with my bank if they don't want to talk with me in the support chat. This AirBnB ""customer service"" has wasted 5 days to tell me they can't help. I assume no answer means the answer is no.

If I get banned from AirBnB? Great. The feeling is mutual.

###Tl;Dr: 

scammer hosts know how to make your AirBNB experience a disaster. And AirBNB customer service enables them.

###Updates
Last Week: I've tweeted at @airbnbhelp. They replied after a few hours with a nice copy paste to say they urged their own internal team to reply.

Last Friday: Took out a Twitter ad and posted the video of the pool. It got 35k views and 40 retweets at @airbnb. Still no progress. But maybe some of those 35k people will reconsider AirBnb next time.

Monday: Now over 100k impressions on my Twitter campaign. I truly hope that I've influenced a potential customer or two to reconsider their booking plans.

Not sure if this is money well spent, or if my wife would agree, but this angry money makes me feel better.



Update Monday: After 72 hours of leaving me on read, Airbnb support replied [with this](https://imgur.com/a/GthQbLH). Does anybody think my host is going to ”approve” this? 😂 

Went to the Thai Police and filed a police report while I'm still in the area. I just want to fire a shot across the bow to this scammer host for trying to ""renegotiate"" after I'd paid.

Update Tuesday:
Airbnb updated me to say my host didn't respond about refunding the unspent nights. They recommend we just use the review feature now. 

Another Tuesday update: The chargeback is filed with my bank. Spent a few hours organizing all of the notes, pictures, and discrepancies from the listing, and writing a letter to explain why I think I'm entitled to a successful dispute. 

I think it will take a while for this to work it's way through the bank networks but I'll keep updating when there's new information.

Airbnb,"Rented an Airbnb and had colleagues in the house visiting for less than an hour per person, one at a time. Host wants me to pay more!","I rented an entire flat for 5 days, and each day had one person visit for less than an hour per day. The host has accused me of having people 'stay over', and I think he has a camera set up somewhere (maybe in the hallway) to track who comes and goes. But the people didn't stay over, they left, and literally less than an hour per person. 

He has really upset me by accusing me of taking advantage and asking to pay more. I told him I absolutely wouldn't be paying more. Am I in the right?

I'm tempted to leave a bad review for the Airbnb as the apartment was amazing but the host accusing me of something I didn't do is really upsetting and ruined the last day of the holiday.

Feedback appreciated!

Edit: to add more detail, The host asked me 3 months before I arrived, just after I booked, it it would just be me staying, I said yes, just me, but I will have colleagues visit occasionally who will not stay, he clearly didn't have a problem with it as he accepted the booking, and is now saying I owe him money!",212,250,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/137b68c/rented_an_airbnb_and_had_colleagues_in_the_house/,2023-05-04 05:33:49,Airbnb

>  
>After social-media backlash more than a year ago, Airbnb announced a review of its fees.  
>  
>By Allison Pohle  
>  
>Nov. 7, 2022 4:00 am ET  
>  
>The cleaning fees that customers of Airbnb Inc. have long complained about will soon become more apparent early in searches for lodging, the company says.  
>  
>Starting in December, on an undetermined date, the company will allow guests to filter their search results by the total cost of the stay before taxes, Chief Executive Brian Chesky said on Sunday. That means the often-maligned cleaning fees will be among the fees included in the prices customers see.  
>  
>Guests will need to hit a toggle switch to display the total cost of nightly rates and fees, rather than just the nightly rate, which now is often the only cost customers in the U.S. and elsewhere see early in the shopping process. Once a customer selects the feature, the total price will display on maps, wish lists, in itineraries and when searching by price range, Mr. Chesky says.  
>  
>“We want everyone to see it. We want people to turn it on,” he says. The feature will stay turned on as long as the person is logged in, so it doesn’t need to be selected every time, he says.  
>  
>Starting next month, Airbnb will let people search by total price, including all fees before taxes. PHOTO: AIRBNB The change comes after complaints the company heard regarding how pricing is displayed on the platform. After social-media backlash last year, Airbnb announced a review of its fees in May 2021. The company said it aimed to have the review and recommendations in place by Dec. 15 of that year.  
>  
>Asked why the process took nearly another year, Mr. Chesky says that it involved feedback from hosts and guests, and turned into a general review of pricing. The company tested defaulting to displaying the total cost of the stay, a feature already mandated by law in certain countries, including those in the European Union. When Airbnb displayed the total price without any reference to the change, people were confused, he says.  
>  
>“The prices do look more expensive. They don’t know why they’re more expensive and certainly that’s not helpful to business,” he says. He added that Airbnb needed extra time to get the design of the display right. Toggling on and off allows people to become aware of what changes were made in the display, he says.  
>  
>The change is one of a few the company is announcing formally Monday. The total cost of the stay will also factor more heavily into search results, regardless of whether users toggle the total price feature. Listings with better value, determined by price and quality relative to other listings in their area, will rank higher in search results, the company says. This change is live, but will continue to be refined, Mr. Chesky says.  
>  
>In the coming months, hosts will have access to tools to set more variable pricing, including seasonal and weekend discounts, the company says.  
>  
>Early next year, Airbnb also plans to make predeparture requirements related to cleaning easier to find on listings so people can evaluate them before they book, Mr. Chesky says.  
>  
>This also means updating guidelines for hosts on what is a reasonable task, he says. Some requirements, such as turning off lights and locking doors are reasonable, but, others, such as vacuuming and doing laundry, cross a line, he says.

Airbnb,Our Airbnb was broken into: Our cash and belongings were stolen. Airbnb and host have ghosted us. [USA] ,"Hello, 

My friend and I recently stayed in an Airbnb I. Miami. As per the title, it was broken into despite us locking every door and all our cash (1500 usd and 500 cad) and jewelry were stolen. 

The host assured us we would be made whole. He even provided security cameras from the neighbours confirming who broke into our place.  We contacted the police and filed a police report then immediately transitioned to a hotel. 

Airbnb only covered a very small part of our hotel stay and refunded us the remaining days for our initial stay (3 days).

After the period for leaving a review (2 weeks) the host ghosted us since I could no longer leave an accurate review of my experience. I held off thinking  we would find resolve but now I regret not leaving a review since he was only communicating with us and assuring reimbursement to save the properties reputation.  Airbnb has closed out all of my service requests for assistance in this matter. Saying it’s already been resolved.

I would like to be reimbursed for atleast PART of our stolen belongings (mind you it was fine jewelry so it was thousands stolen on top of our cash), as well as the full Airbnb stay.

I’m begging for your opinions on how to best navigate this and find resolve. We have proof of the incident, texts from the hosts confirming the crime and for us not to worry, as well as the police report

This has been ongoing for months and im at my breaking point .

Airbnb,AirBnb host rented out the pool through Swimply while we're here. [USA],"The listing for the house and pool makes mention that the pool ""is not private"" which we assumed to mean either we had to share it with other nearby renters, or the pool area is visible from the road.  But instead we checked in were told by the owner that the pool is being used by renters from [Swimply.com](http://Swimply.com) and we can't use it until 8pm.  We told her she never told us she was doing that, and her reply was that saying the pool ""is not private"" in the listing is all she was required to do.

Airbnb,Just another reason to boycott Airbnb.,"If anyone has had success in getting their disaster stays refunded, please let me know. 
The absolute worst lodging experience of my life was May 20th, after the Taylor Swift rain concert. If you know what I’m talking about, you know it was pouring. 
We returned to our AirBnb around 2am to discover the entire downstairs was flooded. We called the host, not expecting an answer at that time but he did answer. He was absolutely shocked and confused that there was water on the floor. Then he hung up on us. 
While we were trying to figure out what to do, since there was ONE towel for a stay of 6 people and we couldn’t dry up the water, he called back and asked if we wanted to cancel. 
At this point it was 3:30am, and we had absolutely nowhere to go considering we had traveled 5.5 hours for this concert and some of us had been drinking and weren’t able to drive.
Upon further investigation, we discovered two holes in the basement floor where a sump pump should have been. The water heater was beeping like crazy for service but the water was not coming from that room. We saw an identical rug rolled up against the wall, presumably to be switched out when the other one got flooded. Then we noticed the baseboards were starting to rot away. It was obvious that this place floods often. The basement rooms smelled like mold. 
When I walked into my bedroom, I discovered that my overnight bag on the ground was saturated and I no longer had any clean/dry clothes to change into. The bag ended up with damage. 
Thinking we could sleep this nightmare away, we crawled into bed only to discover a dead bug under my pillow. When I looked closer at the sheets with a flashlight, I saw all kinds of dirt and hair. The guests staying upstairs had a large stain on their sheets. Of course we photographed everything. 
Apart from the flooding and cleanliness, this place had nothing to offer besides open boxes of food in the cabinet, crusty soap/loofah in the shower, and zero paper towels or hand towels.
When I got home, I was sick with respiratory issues and a cough for a week. 
The host, and AirBnb refuses to refund us because we stayed. We had to jump through hoops just to get the $80 service fee refunded. Our stay was $500. 
As a last ditch effort, we tried disputing the credit card charge, but they fought it. It may be a lost cause, but I do not want to let this go. If I can’t get my money back, I’m at least screaming from the rooftops so everyone knows Airbnb is a joke.",472,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/14f8qvc/just_another_reason_to_boycott_airbnb/,2023-06-21 14:08:22,Airbnb
Airbnb,"War in Israel, flight canceled, Airbnb refuses to refund [Jerusalem, Israel]","We had a flight to Israel planned for today, Oct 7. 

We were scheduled to check into an Airbnb in Tel-Aviv on Oct 8, when we landed, for two nights. 

We were then going to an Airbnb in Jerusalem for two nights. 

This morning, we woke up to news of the war and shortly thereafter, our airline canceled our flight.

We reached out to Airbnb to cancel our reservations under their “extenuating circumstances” policy seen here https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1320

They have refunded our Tel-Aviv stay but have refused to refund our Jerusalem stay, saying it does not qualify but will not tell us why. It is obvious that it does in fact qualify as there is an active war/terrorism and we literally cannot get to the country. People are sheltering in place and checkpoints are closed.

Airbnb,Airbnb host charging me $320 for lost keys,"I lost the keys to the apartment. At the time I was locked out of the apartment had to sleep in the street and the host wasn’t even replying to me. Called him and he said he has no spare keys and there’s nothing he can do about it until Monday (lost keys on Friday).

Called Airbnb on Friday and they said they could reimburse me for one night hotel. Which meant I’ve got no accommodation for Saturday and Sunday.

I ended up knocking on the neighbours door and jumped a balcony on the 22nd floor just to get in.

I leave the Airbnb on Tuesday and the host contacts me saying there were no spare keys after all and he had to replace the lock and that cost him 323 dollars and he wants me to reimburse him.

I take full accountability in losing the key and don’t mind paying a fee for doing that but 323 dollars for changing a lock is ridiculous. What can I do in this situation?

Edit: again I understand it’s my fault but the host absolutely did not care. He wasn’t replying until we got Airbnb involved. He basically told us we were on our own for 3 days, I had to sleep on the street for the first night. I know for a fact there was a spare key because I used to live in a apartment building that was owned by the same company (they have apartment buildings all over the country) and management always had a spare key. I don’t care about the 323 dollars as much as I care about how he just didn’t care at all.

Airbnb,Stayed at an Airbnb with a ‘no shoes’ rule. Did I do something wrong? [Canada],"Ok so I was at an Airbnb where I had a private bedroom and bathroom. The host was there. The listing had some standard rules like no smoking, no shoes in the house. 

Anyway, I get there and I’m wearing sandals (no socks cause I’m not a weirdo). The host greets me at the door and invites me in. I ask if she wants me to take off my sandals since I’m not sure how she feels about bare feet in her house. She says ‘yes please’, so I take them off and go barefoot. Then she gives me a house tour, offers me coffee and tea, and everything was lovely. She was very friendly. 

The issue arose the next day when I was taking pics of the place and showing my friend. My bare feet happened to make it into one of the pics, and my friend asks ‘why are you barefoot at the Airbnb?’ so I explained the house rule and how I came in sandals. She tells me I should’ve brought socks or slippers to wear in the house, and she’d be surprised if the host doesn’t dock me in the review. She said it’s gross and unhygienic to walk barefoot in someone’s house. Is she trolling me?

Airbnb,The last time I’m getting taken advantage of by airbnb hosts. I’m done! [USA],"So a few weeks ago, I checked out of a place that I stayed at for a week. It was an extremely nice place, except it had  a mold problem. the very last day my brother was having a hard time breathing (late night before check out) so he was at the hospital in the morning because he really was struggling. We were supposed to check out at 10. He thought checkout was at 11.

At 10 o’clock, he hadn’t made it back from the hospital yet so I packed his stuff for him and left it stacked outside the front door of the place.  I didn’t want to hold the cleaning crew up as I knew they had to turn the place over. The host was literally blowing up my cell phone calling and texting. There was nothing left of ours in that house.  My brother got stuck at the hospital for a few hours so I ended up having to go back and grab his stuff for him. At this point I made contact with the host who said nothing negative to me. The cleaning crew was done and standing right there.. the host even  cracked a joke about my dog.

I thought all was fine until 3 days later I get pinged with a $250 charge. What was I charged for? 

1) I took a mirror off the wall in one of the bedrooms to use it in the other bedroom and I just simply did not hang it back up on the screws on the wall.. I did not want to scratch the wall , so I left it sitting there. All they had to do is pick it up and literally drape it over the screw on the wall.

2) there’s a part of the refrigerator fan area (on the bottom below the door) and part of it was snapped off (not broken) and was like that when I checked
In.. and instead of either hurting myself by hitting it with my foot or breaking it completely, we simply snapped the other half off and placed it  next to the refrigerator. It’s a piece that snaps back on, but I wasn’t sure how to snap it back on, so I left it standing next to the refrigerator. It was not broken.

3) there was a some kind of air quality issue in there where my brother was having a hard time breathing. He didn’t feel well so the sheets in the master bedroom had obvious sweat stains on them because he was sick, but I had already washed the sheets once and they came completely clean and I didn’t even use bleach, so I’m not sure if they weren’t planning on washing them or what?

All of that totaled $250. Air bnb sided with them. I have a video of how I left the place upon check out and the place was left in the same condition it was when we got there. There was nothing broken or in need of repair, and nothing a simple wash load wouldn’t have taken care of.

I know the host is retaliating because of the mix up with with my brothers things. My brother went to the hospital the very last night late at night because he was having a hard time breathing because there was a mold issue in the house. I wasn’t even going to bring up that at all, but my brother was really struggling that last night he was there, so that’s why he wasn’t able to get his stuff out by 10 AM. But I packed it up for him and got it out of the house. 

I’ve already reached out to air bnb via twitter and they are asking for more info. I will be doing that, just wondering if anyone has any other thoughts or advice?

I’m done with air bnb but I’m livid about the situation.

My property has two homes on one lot and I live in the small front unit while the Airbnb home is in a nice private lot behind my home. It was a great ride but airbnbs customer service is a joke these days and will not do anything to help the host, even when they are threatened from a guest. 

Here’s the story:

I received a last minute instant-booking Monday at 6 pm and my cleaners car broke down earlier and communicated that they’d be really late (usually cleanings are completed by 3 pm) 

I let the guest know about the situation and communicated that my wife and I will be cleaning the home to have it ready by 8 pm for the guest (We cleaned the home for a whole year before hiring professional cleaners). 

I offered a $100 credit towards their stay and let them know if that wasn’t enough, they are able to cancel due to the inconvenience. 

I didn’t receive a message back on Airbnb so I decided to call the gentlemen to alert him in case he wasn’t aware of the situation, but the phone number is disconnected. I sent a text message anyways so I had proof that I tried reaching out in different ways. 

I made sure to communicate when we were nearing completion and sent a message on Airbnb at 8 pm alerting the guest that the home was ready. 

I still didn’t receive a response so I tried calling a few more times, but left it alone since it was late. 

The next morning rolls by and still no guest.

Odd. 

I thought it was potentially a company that booked it since I’ve had a few past guests miss the first night. 

Next day at 11:30 am, the guest sent a disturbing and scary message. 

“I need cancellation I need my money Place back in my account all I need another place of my choice with a week's extension for free for the hassle and the b******* for sleeping on the streets with my kids the whole nine yards last night it was b******* I've never been through this before with you guys I need to know something now. 

I need to know the f****** proper address and yes I would like at least two to three days of extra for the f****** b******* that we had to go through you don't understand me and my kids were sleeping in the truck on the side of the road in the neighborhood we have no no nothing about okay that's not too much to ask for and I need the address that just I got was 845 okay there was no 845 we walked all over the damn place we even ask people on the street no one knew what was that we couldn't find it otherwise I want my full refund. 

So what are we doing I'm sitting here waiting for some kind of answer I'm tired of waiting I'm tired of all this s*** I need to know something now.”

My wife and I instantly felt scared and threatened as we had to host this crazy guy for 5 nights. 

Those message came from nowhere and we instantly wanted to cancel to get this guy away. We attempted to cancel but airbnb doesn’t allow us to cancel during a stay. So I called customer service and my god…. 

I spoke to 10 different airbnb specialists (I’m not kidding) to have this guy’s booking canceled but they said that they’d investigate and get back to me in a hour or two. 

Every single agent said the same exact thing for the next 4 days. I have screenshots of everything. 

The crazy guy then roamed my entire property knocking on my own private home, my windows, and into my backyard to find us.

My wife and I have never felt more scared in our entire lives. 

I told airbnb to contact him and let him know that he’ll get his money back and to leave my property right away. They never contacted him. 

I messaged him that he is no longer allowed on the property and he needs to call airbnb. If he started acting more threatening, I was going to call the police. 

There’s a lot more to this story but In a nutshell:

Airbnb did nothing to resolve it as he continued to send disturbing messages to me via airbnb message, text and a voicemail from a random number. Airbnb finally called me on the last night asking if I can cancel and give the money back to the guest… on the last night. Oh, and I would lose super host status for canceling. 

They literally told me that it is what it is and we’re sorry. 

I let them know that I’ll be exposing their terrible airbnb protocols in order to change their business model to help protect and assist hosts and future guests from any threatening or scary situations. They apologized in the most unauthentic way and said can we help you with anything else? 

I hung up. 

Please be safe everyone. Airbnb is NOTHING like before and if you have any issues, you’ll get screwed. 

I’m using VRBO and Booking.com until I can rent the home out.

*Edit - He stated he slept in his truck with his kids but for some reason, he posted his Gov ID as his profile picture which is how I looked him up and found his criminal record. That's when my wife and I were incredibly terrified.

Airbnb,"Airbnb does not care about customers, only hosts who pay the listing fees.","I’ve now had two separate property owners cancel on bookings. The first was made 6 months ago with deposit fully paid. The owner of this first cottage cancelled the booking 3 months later with no explanation given. Airbnb did nothing except ensure we were refunded. 

We then went and booked a second cottage at a higher price as there was nothing else available for the same time frame. Now, 3 months later the 2nd cottage owner has notified us they intend to sell the property and cannot commit to the booking. We are left in limbo waiting to hear if the property sold, meanwhile nothing comparable is available. 

Airbnb doesn’t care at all about the customer. They simply make sure the deposit is refunded.  I feel that they should assist the customer in finding comparable options and make the customer whole. Am I wrong? Has anyone else had a similar or better experience? Is there a better way to escalate this?

Airbnb,Do people not understand that hotels have more cameras than Airbnbs? [usa],"I totally agree that cameras should not be indoors nor outdoors where people might be socializing like the patio area. 

But I don’t understand why people are opposed to outdoor cameras that simply monitor guest count (like is a party happening) and general surveillance of the property. For example, I see it’s 11 am and their cars are gone. I’m going to send the cleaners over to start. 

At hotels you have cameras everywhere- lobby, elevator, outdoor dining area possibly, every entrance/exit

They say people who have nothing to hide, hide nothing. So I don’t understand why you’d be bothered by a camera over the garage or by the front door when hotels have 5x more cameras on the property. 

I work at a school with cameras. I’m not bothered because I’m not doing anything wrong, and if there’s a discrepancy things can be checked. 

I think a general understanding from hosts and guests needs to happen. Hosts should not be using the cameras to ‘spy’ unnecessarily. 

And guests should not complain about cameras (stating privacy concerns) when really they just want to sneak in unregistered guests or break house rules. ",0,142,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1dsv9wn/do_people_not_understand_that_hotels_have_more/,2024-07-01 15:06:44,Airbnb
Airbnb,Host claimed i had to many ppl at the residence. AIRBNB cancelled my reservation without taking to me. [USA],"Host called the cops on me and my family for having to many people. I had regestered 9 people , property fits 12. Host has cameras and airbnb cancelled my reservation without talking to me 4 hours in our stay. House was shitty and looked nothing like pictures. 

Can i sue airbnb for throwing my out on the street in the middle of the night for a wrong reason and without talking to me? Airbnb support is still standing with whatever the host provided. Airbnb contact person first agreeded this was wrong but didnt solve my case in time.

Airbnb,"Some of the rules for these AirBnBs are absurd. And they 100% discriminate based on age/gender [CA, USA]","Some of the house rules for AirBnBs are absurd. And they 100% discriminate based on age.

Trying to book a place for a get together for a bunch of friends and I, and because we’re all around the age of 28-34, we’ve been rejected at two places. I have a 4.9 rating, have always been super respectful. But because there’s 10 guys they think it’s a bachelor party and we’re gonna burn the house down. 

And the houses we have to choose from now have absolutely insane rules: 

- Absolutely no noise after 9pm on Thursday, 10pm Friday. This is enforced by a “noise monitor” like wtf? I can’t make any noise in a house I rent after 10pm on weekends? 

- No smoking indoors or outdoors. I can 100% see indoors but outdoors? Wild 

- No additional guests (10 guest maximum even though it says 11 beds, sleeps 16), and any extra guest incurs a $100 charge per head. How would they know this unless they’re spying on us?

- refrigerator/freezer/stove/oven must be deep cleaned after use. I gotta clean the inside of the oven are u kidding me?! What’s the $800 cleaning charge for then?

Airbnb,What Happened to Airbnb?,"I'm a Masters student finishing my thesis, and planning a summer trip to a German city where I've lived in the past. After several years of not using Airbnb, I started looking up places to stay yesterday, and I was absolutely SHOCKED by the state of things.

Mind you, I really don't need much - I want to be alone, to be able to afford it and for the place to not be falling apart. I tend to look to rent entire places due to private room horror stories I've heard recently, but I don't care about location, size, anything - as long as it's entirely mine, within my budget and not moldy. But apparently that's too much to ask for nowadays?

&#x200B;

First of all, the price: I used to stay at genuinely nice places for 30 euros/night, sometimes even less. I'm a student, budget is tight - location can be anywhere, size can be a shoebox. But now, affordable is non-existent. For example: a street in Prague where I stayed a few years ago - nothing fancy, not central, communist buildings, but great small flats - costs me 15e/night, before fees. It is now 60-70e/night, before fees. What? But there's a camper / van for 40 euros / night? Are you serious? Oh and don't even get me started on fees - I don't understand why they're so high, they literally add on a fourth, if not more, of the cost of stay. It's downright misleading. 

Second - the reviews. While I have managed to dig up some affordable listings, they all either a) lack reviews whatsoever, or b) have reviews - the automated ones saying ""The host cancelled this reservation XY days before arrival"".

The site honestly looks like a shell of its former self, where you're now either expected to pay  through the nose or just gamble with your money and go in blind. I'm very sad because Airbnb used to be phenomenal, but at this point I'm starting to look at hotels, because they offer so much more guarantee for the same, if not smaller price. Am I crazy? Or has Airbnb really dropped off?",277,277,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/v7nycd/what_happened_to_airbnb/,2022-06-08 12:01:04,Airbnb
Airbnb,Airbnb/guest my friend brought chalk to the...[US],"My friend brought chalk to the Airbnb and made like a little umbrella and wrote my name on the concrete by the pool. We didn't have chalk all over the place. We left everything nice and neat. Our host wrote a review stating that we left the place in great condition and gave me five stars. I left a review stating that the beds were uncomfortable. We should have had a late check out or discount because the host wasn't done renovating the house, so we had to wait two hours to check in. I also stated that I would recommend this place to others. I gave them four stars. Well a little while after my review I get an email stating I owe over $2,700 for damages caused by the chalk on the concrete. A mediator chimes in and decides that I only owe $700 in damages because of chalk on the concrete. I asked for an invoice and the invoice was made by the host. The mediator also asked me how much money I was willing to give if not $700. I told them I was not willing to give any money that a pressure washer could wash off the chalk. They stated the chalk still did not come off. Now they're automatically charging me $700 on October 8th for chalk on concrete. What should I do? The chalk was meant for concrete. They also painted their deck after we stayed there. Saying they had to paint their whole deck because of the chalk, so that's why they're charging me $700.

Airbnb,"After six cumulative months as an AirBnB guest, I quit","Years ago, when I first started as an AirBnB guest, it was a godsend. Easy to use. Saved money. Stayed in cool places. Enjoyed the idiosyncrasies of different homes. I ended up staying about six cumulative months in short term rentals over time. I have stayed in some AMAZING homes and met terrific hosts.

Now? I quit. Here's why:

1. **I dont believe** **AirBnB cares about you**. Once had wasp nest INSIDE home that the host knew about before renting; home where carbon monoxide detector went off and firefighters came, found improperly installed HVAC; house that was one giant code violation as well as made me and previous guests vomit (my fault I guess, should have dug into those reviews deeper); rental billed as entire home on beach that was actually small apartment in home with rambunctious children and creepy grandpa (best AirBnB customer service response ever: ""Are you sure it's not an entire home?""); host that cancelled just before a trip with expensive non-refundable airfare because they were in violation of local laws; home that had parking space only for compact cars and I had a truck, but only found out after booking it; home with trim nails exposed in doorways that one could step on; and more...  - Most times I did nothing, but for the big problems **EACH TIME I had to fight with AirBnB customer support for hours, and rarely did they help, and overall I lost thousands of dollars.**
2. **The rating system is terrible -** all of the places above where five stars with rave reviews, or just a fraction of a star lower. Many were very expensive. Guests are gaslighted into thinking they need to give everything five stars when in reality, when you think about it, five stars should be the exception, not the rule. I once went against my inclination to always rave in reviews in a home that billed itself as a vacation home and while it was nice, it was just boring, bland, bleh and far away from all the fun stuff they mentioned. I gave them three stars and wrote nice things, but said ""it's just an average house"". The host was MAD and couldn't believe it. But this is actually how reviews should work. I still feel bad for the family for that totally reasonable review and I have to remind myself that the AirBnB gaslighting still has a hold on me after all this time.
3. **Often times it feels like an end run around local laws -** have you heard of hospitality schools, building codes, and zoning ordinances? Shocker, but it turns out smart people have given a lot of thought to the impact of hotels to surrounding areas, making sure the hotel doesn't burn down or asphyxiate everyone, and that the basic needs of travelers are met. But a whole bunch of short term rental hosts don't seem to care. It's dangerous/unpleasant for the guests and can be terrible for neighbors. Once met someone who bought a home in the middle of a forest on a dirt road with ten other homes spaced far apart, and lived there in peace for years. Well, one owner decided to do short term rentals. Now out-of-town guests speed down the road every day about 2-5 faster than the other owners, so walking the dog is now a hazardous activity. I once had a next door neighbor to a home I was renting tell me ""The neighborhood really likes you because you are quiet. Unfortunately most of the guests here are terrible and we pretty much hate your host.""
4. **Hosts will ask you to clean the house and still charge you a cleaning fee -** This happens all the time - there's a rental with a hefty rental fee, ok, fine, I agree to it. But then AFTER arriving, there are a list of rules that weren't presented up front. Part of those is doing one or more hours of work cleaning the place. What? If you charge a cleaning fee, don't ask guests to clean. I had one house that charged a hefty fee, asked us to clean, and then left a tip envelope out for the host's cleaning crew. LMAO NO. And of course, if you don't clean it, you run the risk of the host lowering your rating, so you do it.
5. **The guest rating system makes it hard to complain which in turn can make a trip miserable -** If I'm in a hotel, and the hotel brings room service with the wrong food, or the toilet doesn't work, or any number of things are wrong, I can complain! And guess what, I don't have to be afraid my complaints will keep this hotel or other hotels from letting me book a room! But with AirBnB you always run the risk of irritating a host and them in turn tanking your guest rating. Ugh.

In my opinion, the sad thing about all this is that **there are great hosts out there** but it's all being ruined by what I perceive as the **greed and indifference of AirBnB.** They only seem to care about those sweet sweet fees, a portion of which I guess they use to hire lobbyists to fight legislation to improve the experience.

I removed the address and the link to the property this go around.  To clarify, I don't have issue with the property being relisted.  My frustration is that we were not afforded an opportunity to leave a review.  In other words, the host or AirBnb deleted the listing prior to us being able to leave a review and have since relisted it, effectively covering up a relevant experience per AirBnb's review policy.

AirBnB denied us the ability to leave a review.  Guests should be aware of the danger they are exposed to at properties like this.

Airbnb,Help! AirBnb host charging us $1700 for damages [USA],"Stayed at an AirBnb in Austin and the host is charging us $360 saying we ""broke"" an outdoor TV, which never turned on, and $1350 for replacing a bed which had one of the bed frame rails snap when I sat down on it.  We disputed the cost to AirBnb and they sided with the Host saying we have no proof we didnt do the damage.

I dont understand how AirBnb can say we broke a TV that does not turn on. We never touched the TV during the stay and only used the remote to try and turn it on.

For the bed rail, I (160 lb) sat down on the bed and it snapped, now we are on the hook for a replacement bed frame costing $1300.

Obviously this host is scamming us, but how can AirBnb allow this kind of scammy behavior on their platform? Does anyone have any suggestion on what we can do next?

Airbnb,Another one bites the dust: done with Airbnb [France],"17 times I have rented an Airbnb and 17 times I have received very good reviews from my host, because my wife and I are good guests. We leave our places neat and tidy and are careful with the host's apartment. We abide by the rules, are not noisy and are conscientious with regards to the neighbors.

This last time, we received a negative review for not taking out the trash and doing the dishes. Airbnb refused to remove the review, despite the fact that there were no instructions from the host that we need to take care of the trash or clean every last dish. In our previous stays, we did the trash/dishes when instructed, and did not do so when not instructed. We received positive reviews every single time.

Only after this experience did I ply r/airbnb and find out that there is an unwritten rule, or norm, relating to trash and dishes. We thought these expectations were particular to the host since some hosts mentioned these things while others did not. Of course, leaving sinks overflowing with crusty dishes or trash where it does not belong (trash cans) is just rude behavior towards the cleaner. But leaving a few rinsed dishes in the sink, and trash in trashcans, seemed reasonable to me.

It is unfair that the guest should have to know the host's or the host community's unwritten rules, especially in the context of a cleaning fee ($65). It's unfair that Airbnb does not support its guests, especially in cases where negative reviews are left regarding criteria that are not part of the instructions, and where you have a guest who has a long history of good reviews. 

Hosts and Airbnb itself are contributing to a negative perception towards Airbnb stays. The host community ought to react accordingly and make the platform more customer friendly.

Airbnb,Tenant Illegally Airbnb-ing My Property and I am being fined $1K per day – Need Advice on How to Stop It [CANADA],"Hi everyone. I’m a landlord, and I’m currently dealing with a tenant who has illegally listed my property on Airbnb without permission. This goes against the lease agreement and the building’s policies (I live in Montreal, Canada, where regulations around short-term rentals are pretty strict). Not only did they ignore my initial warnings, but they also changed the locks without telling me.

After several ignored messages, they finally admitted to it, but they’re still actively hosting guests and won’t respond to my calls or emails. The building has now started issuing fines against me due to this illegal Airbnb activity, and I’m stuck with the costs. $1K per day!!

I called Airbnb support many times but they’re really useless and not helpful and not stopping the listing. if anyone has been through a similar situation, I’d really appreciate your insights. Is there any way to fast-track this? Can Airbnb assist in taking down the listing if it’s unauthorized? Also, any advice on getting the tenant to cover the fines would be helpful.

Airbnb,host entered airbnb while i was gone (in need of advice) [USA],"hello, i’m hoping to receive some advice about a situation that i am actively dealing with. i’m staying in an airbnb with my boyfriend in hawaii and we are from iowa. it is a studio room with a private entrance attached to a house where the host and their family lives. we were provided a key to lock and unlock our door to our property. today, my boyfriend and i left a fan on in the room to keep the room cool while we were out. we came back to the fan being switched off, meaning someone came in and switched the fan off. this came off to us as a huge invasion of privacy and made us extremely uncomfortable knowing someone entered our space. later, i received a message a few hours later from them asking us to turn off fans after we leave, proving it was her turning off our fan and entering our personal space. what do we do? we still have a few more nights here and are worried about stirring something up while still being in the space, but more concerned about our privacy being invaded. here is the message for your reference: Hi (my name), how are things going for you?
I would appreciate if you could, please, turn off the fans before you leave; also, make sure that you turn off the light in the back patio as well. Thank you!

Airbnb,UPDATE: Accidentally ( a sincerely honest everyday oversight) booked a one-person AirBNB back in December and was refused a room just prior to traveling to the city because I was with my wife. Outcome….,"Thanks Mods for closing this. It was getting too far away from the intent.

This should absolutely be locked in for history though for those going through the same issue.

It comes down to this:

Sure, the guest should do everything possible to make sure the place fits their needs. We all do that. BUT, it's very possible to miss basic elements, like missing the change to the default setting of number of guests.

BUT WAY MORE IMPORTANTLY - If a host has an oddity about their place, it is incumbent upon the host to immediately contact the guest and reiterate the oddity (eg no one who owns a cat may stay here due to allergies, or, this looks like a room for two, but only one guest is permitted.)

If this were done in this case, or myriad like it, there would have not been this confusion frustration, loss of funding, almost loss of $500 for not being able to stay, etc.

Hosts - You have chosen to turn your place into a professional business. It's not just post-and-profit. It means that you need to have everyone's expectations being on the same page. One small note describing oddities will clear this all up.

Don't be lazy. Be proactive.




I left the setting to one-guest in an honest, accidental oversight. I booked a queen bed “suite” with a separate entrance believing it was for two people. 

A day before the trip, the host notices that I replied something like “ …and we plan to arrive at 8:00”

She freaks and says - you can’t come here. This is for only one person. This is the first time I heard from her about that oddity for the 5 months that the place has been booked. 

They refused refused refused a credit, a change to two people for an up charge, or a credit for another place - over and over both corporate and the host. Two days of constant effort to get it fixed. Nothing. 

As advised here, I was very persistent and polite. As a backup, I had the chargeback ready to go. 

After at least 8 refusals to credit anything more than $70 on a $500 charge (without being allowed to stay at the place I booked), the host finally relented the day before the trip. 

In retrospect, it was my oversight. But, only because the UX User Experience lead me that way. I missed the default setting of changing to two travelers not having ANY idea that some places posted as a suite with a queen bed only accept one traveler. That blew my mind. 

Anyhow - any future being reading this - stick to your guns, DON’T cancel, be relentless and polite.

And hosts reading this - if you have an oddity about your place, it’s incumbent upon you to stress, far beyond normal, that oddity at every step of the way. (Eg We want to make certain that you know - this Suite with a queen bed is for one person only - if you own a cat at home, you may not stay here - this residence is at the base of a nuclear cooling tower - there is a state prison next door - if you bring your own food, you will be ejected - you need to swim across a moat to get here - non-smokers are not welcome, if you do NOT smoke you will be barred and not refunded, etc. anything that is an oddity that people would not naturally expect needs to be emphasized at every step of the way.

Note that anyone reading this post may not reply unless it contains the word “asparagus”. If not done properly, you will be required to compensate OP with a token of no less cost than 250 coins. You will also be permanently banned from all future posts. 

Another example - 

You are about to show up and the host notices that you have a cat at home. He then refuses entry and won’t refund. In the fine print it reads “no one who owns a cat may stay here due to allergies.”

In this case, is it upon every guest to read the fine print of every listing in detail? Or is it the job of the host to know that normal people expect a normal experience and it is upon them to emphasize at every step of the way - “we just received your request. We want to be sure you know that we cannot have any cat owners stay here”. 

Hosts cannot completely rely upon a button that is defaulted to “I don’t have cats at home”. If that  oddity is strong enough to cancel the stay, that oddity needs to be stressed at every point with assurance that the guest understands the oddity. 

If we are all relegated to reading and agreeing to the fine print of every transaction or purchase we ever made, society would grind to a halt. 

Normal people expect normal things from a host. If the host has an oddity that is strong enough to ban the guest - it’s upon the host to bring this to the forefront and not just as a side note that can be overlooked.

I have got to stress this post below. It cracks me up. It's like ""Leopards Ate My Face"". He proves my point of the ability to make a simple oversight, while denouncing that I made a simple oversight.

From: Hades_Enjoyer

As someone who uses AirBNB, I have never ""forgotten"" to inform the host of how many guests I was bringing, nor would I have taken your approach of begging for a refund.

While I'm glad you got your money back, you're an absolute unadulterated muppet for not realizing that AirBNB is not the same as a hotel, and you need to search for EXACTLY what you're signing up for in order to ensure you're getting what you intend to pay for.

Edit: That said, AirBNB sucks and I'll never actually use them again anyways. It's just a total crapshoot even when you do everything right.

....AirBNB sucks and I'll never actually use them again anyways. It's just a total crapshoot even when you do everything right.

Hahahhahhahahhah

I have never seen anything more funny in all My life.

""It's just a total crapshoot even when you do everything right.""

Hahahahahhah  Wow.

----------------

There is a lesson here for hosts reading this - 

If you are hosting a place with an oddity that is not what a normal person might expect, like you can't allow a person with a cat at home to stay, or host next to a mental asylum, or have a queen suite but only one guest may stay, or any other oddity that a normal person would not expect - it is incumbent upon you to stress this oddity to the prospective guest - NOT WITH JUST A NOTE ON THE SITE - but as a proactive message directly to the prospect during the cancelation window ""I just wanted to be certain that you know that we have this (oddity) - are you aware of that? If not, we have 36 more hours for you to reconsider.""

It will save everyone from the above story.

The ONLY reason to not do so is pure laziness on the host's behalf.

(And to cut things off for the overlords - IF IT IS POSSIBLE for a person to arrive at checkout with a misunderstanding, AND you have an oddity that would not be expected from a cursory glance at the images and basic layout, you need to make sure you are on the same page with the guest - PROACTIVELY.)

It is incumbent upon the person gaining profit to be sure that there is a meeting of the minds. It's not the duty of the customer (the one paying the bill) to know more than the owner of the property.

It is lazy for you to assume every customer knows every single detail of your place. It is your job to make sure your oddity is understood.",113,268,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/12r96fs/update_accidentally_a_sincerely_honest_everyday/,2023-04-18 23:47:16,Airbnb

Airbnb,"Airbnb host wants us to cancel right after booking m, won’t refund $4500, Airbnb not helping [USA]","We booked an airbnb that lists 16+, and says more can fit with permission from host. 

It says multiple times in the listing that it won’t be confirmed until both parties sign an agreement facilitated through a management company, to ensure we’re aligned. 

Company reached out. Asked  about our guest count. We weren’t sure yet. We asked about number of kids and bringing  pack and plays. They had us estimate total number of people each night and we did. 

They came back and said that’s too many people, they can’t accommodate. We said fine. We both agreed we’d look for another spot. We asked for a refund since we didn’t  ever sign any docs they listed in the listing and in the emails (they said multiple times in the email that it wasn’t confirmed yet). They told us we had to cancel. 

If we cancel, even though they said it won’t be confirmed until we sign the contract, Airbnb will not refund our $4,500. 

I saw something online that if they cancel, they won’t be charged. Even if they are charged something, it can’t possibly be $4,500. 

We spoke to a useless airbnb rep who just keeps saying “the listing is for 16 people max, you have to cancel, etc.” No it’s not. It says 16+ and that it’s not confirmed until we align and sign. 

We asked to speak to someone else yesterday. He was condescending and said “who do you want to talk to?” We said a supervisor. He said he’d escalate. 

He just sent a messaged 24 hours later to the app and said he talked to the host and they won’t refund. No mention of escalation. We just sent another message saying we need to speak to a supervisor.

Airbnb,Airbnb host goes into our flat watches us having s*x and refuses to go. What to do now? [Germany],"Hi Guys,
So yeah the title basically says everything.
We booked an airbnb flat in Germany where the host is living next door. We ordered some food put on a movie, had sex and totally forgot about the food.
My boyfriend being balls deep into me I finally notice a face standing behind him. Our host. Idk how long he stood there. He grinned at us, told us our food is here. Of course we told him to fucking leave, he refused to, started talking about our tv being too loud and scolded us for being unable to track the food since we were having sex. (Apparently he met the delivery guy in front of the door) He stood there for at least 4 mins talking to us while we were both COMPLETLY NAKED. And REFUSED TO LEAVE. 
I’m so digusted at his perverted grin. This will live rent free in my head for the next months.
In the community guidelines I read, that he isn’t even allowed to get into the flat while it’s unattended based on Airbnbs Privacy Law.

What can we do now? Can we take legal action? Or shall we call Airbnb? 


Update: He now told us that the door „wasn’t locked and so it was okay for him to enter“ Wtf?? 🤢

Update 2: We just filed a police report on the local police website. We also called the delivery guy to give us his testimony. We will call Airbnb in the morning since both of us don’t want to start any drama before tomorrow morning. We are both too tired to leave this night. We put a dresser in front of the door so we won’t be disturbed again. 

Update 3: Soo we got out of the apartment this morning. We didn’t see him again that night or this morning. I was so mad, I put most of the rice of the food, we ordered yesterday and didn’t eat, in the dishwasher and put it on. He will have to replace it I think since most of the holes there will now be full of rice lmao. (Had this problem at my former apartment) This morning we sent an email to Airbnb where we told them about the whole thing, that we already started legal action on the police website and that we wanna get compensation. Not sure if I also wanna call them to make it more urgent. Also we made an appointment with the lawyer of the company we work at cause he’s a total shark.
We asked 15k for him and 20k for me as compensation for invading privacy and mental damages but I don’t think we will even get nearly as much since we ain’t in America. But dream big right?
He has a wife and kids so I think at least this will be fucked after all of this.
He is still burned in my memory.
I can’t even remember how he looked like only the fucking weird smile in his face.
If you are interested I will update after the police came back to us and after we talked to our lawyer.

Airbnb,"Finally done with Airbnb after a decade of amazing experiences [MTL, QC]","This is a follow up post.

I booked an Airbnb for my girlfriend and I for a month, four days in advance. I accidentally put in 1 guest instead of 2 as 99% of the time there is no difference in charge. As I go to add a guest after I booked, I find that an additional guest is $2000 more a month. Mind you, this is to literally share a double bed. The initial price was $3000, so paying $5000 for a couple seems insane. Within 24hrs of booking I communicate this with the host, but they seem firm on it. Trying to be honest with the host, I ask if there's any way I can get a full refund as I can't afford $5,000 for the month. Turns out they had the strict cancellation policy enabled and because its a last minute booking, there's no refunds. I beg the host and Airbnb support to please refund me as there has been no lost time for the host's listing as I just booked it hours ago. The host says no to any refund. Not a penny. I can't afford $5,000, and my girlfriend needs a place to stay, so I cancelled the listing and am now out $3,000. I feel like I just went through a 48 hour fever dream. I know all of the hosts here are going to say ""too bad"", but that ""too bad"" attitude is what is driving more and more people away from the platform. Obviously guests can be extremely frustrating, but moments like this are within the bounds of acceptability and should be remedied. Airbnb hosts charge a premium because you expect at least an absolute bare minimum of hospitality, like being able to immediately cancel quickly after a mistake. Unfortunately, this is the last time I will be using the platform after being an active user for a decade. I have stellar reviews, and have loved every host I've stayed with.

BUT there’s a hot tub in the back yard. it’s about 9pm. we’re just outside in the hot tub. i go inside to use the bathroom and try to open the door and the handle completely comes off. (it was not locked) our phones are inside charging. the code for the front door is on our phones. we cannot seem to fix this handle. it’s done. not connected to the inside part of the handle at all. we’re cold and wet. no windows are unlocked. my boyfriend decided to kick the door in. we felt scared and unsafe. the door frame is destroyed from that but we get in. we DO not think we deserve to get charged. we contacted the host and we are worried they will try to charge us. she said the contractor will be here in the morning to repair it. does anyone have any advice or opinions on what may happen or what we should do? the door was clearly not looked out well enough or fixed for safety purposes. 

UPDATE: contractor came (the same one that put the door in) and basically just thinks we were being stupid and could’ve fixed the door and out of panic, kicked it in. which yes we were scared but we DID weigh our options. there was also no light outside other than a very small lantern by the hot tub. so we weren’t necessarily prepared to fixed a door handle. we are getting charged, not sure how much yet.

Airbnb,Locked out of AirBnB for over 12 hours and had to sleep on porch because of faulty number pad lock [USA],"This is kinda a long story but it’s worth a read. 

My friend and I rented an AirBnB for 4 nights this past weekend because we were in town for the formula 1 race that we booked 6 months ago. The rental was $250/night and we got into town late Thursday night and went straight to bed because we were waking up early to hit the track in the morning. After a long day Friday, we got home and went out on the back porch to relax for a little around 10pm. Around 11pm, we used the code that was provided for the front entrance lock (which worked fine) but the lock would not open. This was a problem because the front door was dead bolted since we were in for the night and there was no other way in. 

We contacted the host around 11pm (we knew this was late) and did not get a response so we called the support line to help get in contact. They did not have any luck and said they would contact us if there was any updates but we were still stuck on the porch for the time being.

The both of us were in shorts, sweatshirts, and no socks in 60 degree weather with constant wind. We had no phone chargers, car keys, wallets, ids, shoes, socks, or water while we were on this porch. That night was the worst night of my life because we had to huddle for warmth and use the cushions off of the lawn chairs as blankets since it was so cold and windy. None of us slept a wink and were starting to feel weird after not sleeping for almost 24 hours. 

The host contacted us around 6:30am and apologized for the situation and said that they were working on a solution. We informed them that we had plans for the f1 race that day and just wanted to be let in asap so we could sleep and still make some of the events for the day. After many false promises of when someone was going to get there to help us in, they did not get to the unit until 12:45pm, just over 6 hours after they knew we were stuck outside with no resources. We had to walk barefoot to the timeshare office that the unit was a part of and ask for a bathroom and some water which felt humiliating. They did tell us to break a window around 11:45 but we did not want to because of the complications that could arise from doing property damage or someone thinking we were breaking in. 

The host did not take responsibility for the lock not working in the first place and a crowbar had to be used in order to get the back door open. We missed all of the events Saturday ($480 value for both of us) because we did not sleep for over 30 hours and could barely stay awake, let alone drive to the track. 

After talking with support and calculating the cost of the events we missed on Saturday for F1, we wanted a refund of $480 plus their partial refund offer of $500 (two nights). They claimed since they hired a locksmith (who came and had to immediately leave since their handyman who used the crowbar was going to replace the entire lock) that they did not want to give us any more of a refund even though I explained how this ruined our trip and effected us for the rest of the trip since we had lack of sleep. 

In the end, AirBnB support added on $200 to the $500 partial refund offer as a gesture and we took it because the issue was going to be closed if we did not accept. 

Not sure if anyone else has experienced something similar but I think it is crazy how a host can get away with something this. We are going to be leaving a review detailing this as a warning for anyone else who rents from this host.

There’s not even a solid door separating the basement from the upper level, just a metal gate with a combo lock and a “sound barrier” on the stairs which is a twin mattress with moving blankets stuffed around it. 

Anyway - all of us were out the second day we were here. The master bedroom had a TV on the dresser and when we came back, the TV was gone. I had no messages from the host about coming in to take the TV, so I sent him a message asking about it. He replied several hours later that the TV was actually a monitor and that he needed it for a high pressure work situation. 

It weirded me out because the TV was on the dresser and the host would have to basically walk over our open suitcases and pile of dirty laundry to grab the TV, which was done without our awareness or permission. If he had messaged beforehand I wouldn’t have had an issue with it but it felt a little violating that he came into our space without letting us know first. My question is - do I just leave a bad review or should I contact Airbnb support? I saw that a host entering without permission was against Airbnb policy but I don’t know how big of a deal it actually is.",413,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/14ckzh7/airbnb_host_came_in_unannounced_while_we_were_out/,2023-06-18 13:50:18,Airbnb
Airbnb,"How would you feel about an AirBnB that had multiple bedrooms, but every single closet was locked? [USA]","Completely new to hosting here. We recently bought a home in a city we love that’s a short drive from the city where we live. Decided to Airbnb it for tax purposes, yada yada. We still want to do a really nice job with the place, as I’m big into decorating and have been in the service industry for ages. Immediately after listing our house, we’ve gotten a bunch of requests.

We have a 3 bedroom place that also has a large hall storage closet on the first floor (4 floors, Houston heights typical townhouse). My in-laws stay at this house frequently as they’re from this city, so the first floor bedroom is “theirs”. They have been keeping their own things in the bedroom closet since we got the house and locking said closet always. I admittedly found that very odd (and let’s be real, a bit rude as it’s not their house), since we weren’t planning to have guests for months, but I guess they just wanted to get in a habit of it…… anyways. 

We have two children who stay in bedroom #2, and ours is bedroom #3. Originally we were just planning on locking bedroom closet #3 and shoving all our stuff in there whenever we left to be prepared for future guests since it’s the biggest closet. However, my husband (and in-laws) have become insistent on putting a lock on every single closet, including the first floor storage closet. I could definitely see the storage closet being locked as normal. But every single closet in the house feels WEIRD! Where do we keep the freaking ironing board? Pack n play we’re providing for guests with babies? At one point my MIL suggested we also lock the pantry door and I had to put my foot down on that one. Like, what’s next? The fridge?

I do want to note that we’ve bought a standing clothing rack with shelves for shoes/luggage for each room. So people will have somewhere to hang their clothes. But I can’t shake the feeling that we are going to weird out our guests.. as a guest I think I would feel odd that every closet is blocked off.

It’s misleading you’ll see a posted price when you’re searching for for a place,  investigate further or at checkout there’s all these other fees tacked on…..It just burns me up and makes me not want to use the platform. My question is why? And why did this all change 3 to 5 years ago? Is it really passing the buck from Airbnb fees that the host then tries to recover as misc fees

Airbnb,I’m in a nightmare airbnb right now and I am dreading the rest of my stay! [USA],"I bought this airbnb for the month and so far, it’s been a nightmare! 

Every day since last week, there have been workers here spending almost the entire day fixing major things in the house like the electrical and piping, rendering the kitchen and bathroom unusable at many times. Those workers make the house smell like weed so badly even when I lock myself in my bedroom I can smell it! The workers swear like sailors and their work is loud to the point where my partner and I can’t hear each other talking. 

I had to pee in a bottle the other night because the ONLY restroom was unusable for several hours (No warning). 

All this and the airbnb owner didn’t give me a heads up about this! The only thing he said was, on the day I was to begin my stay, that there would be workers and that they’d “be around for a little bit and then leave.” I didn’t expect it to be like this! 

I have nowhere else to stay right now. I’m out of state and have no one else to stay with. I have 2 weeks left of this stay, and I’m dreading it! ",55,56,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1g3jhli/im_in_a_nightmare_airbnb_right_now_and_i_am/,2024-10-14 16:08:22,Airbnb
Airbnb,Airbnb defrauded me and abused me and left me on the street [UK],"Okay so I came to the UK for the weekend to watch the LoL world finals.

I booked a flat via airbnb. I was supposed to receive the check in pin for the keybox on the day of the checkin, the pin never came. I asked the host what is going on, and he proceeded to tell me he will be refusing to host me due to apparent “bed bugs”

Picture 1:

https://x.com/starlightapm/status/1852383866297647518?s=46

Ok no issue, airbnb told me they will give me 30 dollar as compensation and to look for a hotel. End of the line.

I found this ridiculous so i posted the tweet above that garnered about 20,000 impressions.

At this point someone from “senior leadership” reached out to me urgently saying they will be compensated me up to 500 USD a night and i can send them a listing to book via airbnb so they will generate a specific coupon

https://x.com/starlightapm/status/1852444188077392132?s=46

Ok finally I had a decent place booked near the event venue for tomorrow, i thought everything will be going well. However 3 hours later airbnb proceeded to tell me they are cancelled my ENTIRE account for apparently planning to host  an “unauthorized party” in the same airbnb my case worker booked for me. Completely removing my access to the support tickets and my account. Only leaving me with a small form to “plead” my case which they will make a decision in 7 days. Now even if i call their support they tell me they cant do anything as their “designated “ team is the only one that has access to my account

Airbnb,"Yet again, Airbnb refusing to honor their extenuating circumstances policy","I just arrived in France and as most people know, there is horrible rioting and looting going on all over. We were supposed to arrive in Paris and take the train to Lyon today, but our Airbnb was literally one block away from a protest location that was deemed illegal, so we knew there would be trouble. We did not feel comfortable arriving at 8 PM right when this protest was scheduled. In the end, the protesters had tear gas released on them and the whole night was filled with rioting, fireworks being shot at police, looting, etc. 

I posted to Reddit to ask people’s advice and everyone suggested we not stay right in this area. It’s too dangerous and unclear right now. If we stayed there, we’d have to shut ourselves in all evening. 

I contacted Airbnb saying I had a safety issue. They never replied through the app. They just closed the case. When we landed in Paris, I called them and the agent is telling me that this does not qualify as an extenuating circumstance despite the fact that rioting and civil unrest are in the policy:

“Military actions and other hostilities. Acts of war, hostilities, invasions, civil war, terrorism, explosions, bombings, rebellions, riots, insurrection, civil disorder, and civil unrest.”

The agent tried to tell me that there’s no military action, so it doesn’t count. Bullshit. That is not how this is written. Now he’s telling me there is no more rioting in Lyon as if they know that. Are we supposed to just assume it’ll all be ok tonight and the next few days? No one knows what’s going to happen. 

I ended up canceling the booking for a measly $107 back on a $455 reservation. They’re telling me it’s up to the listing owner to decide if I can get the rest back. I’m so frustrated. We’ve already had to spend hundreds more on a room in Paris for the night, plus we have to figure out a new booking plan for the next few days.

Airbnb,I'm suing AirBnB and I'm telling you why and how in case you need to do the same [Spain],"I have booked a place in Spain to spend a week with my family in January next year for just under €1,000.

After a long back and forth about which place to choose, I decide on one that looks good to accommodate the family. Just as I click and proceed with the payment, I receive the automatic confirmation that the booking has been accepted.

Delighted I check the booking and I see ""No pets allowed"" which triggered... my mum has a small dog, well behaved but a pet at the end of the day so I immediately texted the host (an agency) stating that if they could make an exception for a well behaved dog or would they mind processing the full refund as I made a mistake and I communicated it to them immediately (no loss to anyone).

Their reply the next day was ""No pets allowed and therefore we cannot process the refund"", no negotiation, no flexibility, no further explanation despite my subsequent messages. They are keeping more than €500 in case I want to cancel, which I find completely unacceptable.

My actions from here:

1. **Opened a case with support** which was a complete waste of time.

**Result**: 2 days back and forth explaining the case to no help and supporting the host's decision with ""Host's policy and we can't do anything as we respect our community"". Apparently they respect their community but not their customers.

2. **Claim via Paypal** to see if there is more sense there as they won't be able to provide the service  
Result: (I will update here when they come back to me)

3. **Take this matter to** [Facua](https://facua.org/whoweare/) to understand what legal actions we can take\*\*.\*\* I am member of this organisation and they have been proved very useful as I am in court with Ryanair as well and so far so good.  
Result: I will update this as it comes.

Additional data:  
The host is a company called Novasol and apparently they are pretty bad given their [trust pilot](https://ie.trustpilot.com/review/www.novasol.com) and [google reviews](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Novasol+AS/@36.6855487,-5.0407102,9z/data=!3m1!5s0xd72f79c71ec695b:0x21f70b2cb43bbaa9!4m12!1m2!2m1!1snovasol!3m8!1s0xd72f796b9d726f1:0xff51c162990860ed!8m2!3d36.71377!4d-4.4343307!9m1!1b1!15sCgdub3Zhc29skgEQY29ycG9yYXRlX29mZmljZeABAA!16s%2Fg%2F11d_7yjt95?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTAyOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).

  
EDIT: for those siding with ""read the terms and conditions"". California has regulated this already:  
24-hour free cancellation period for reservations in California

When you're booking a stay in California at least 72 hours before check-in, you'll have 24 hours to cancel for a full refund. We're doing this to comply with California law and to improve the booking experience.

Airbnb,Host didn't give us the right code for the AIRBNB so we had to cancel.  It was a huge headache.  What kind of review should I give?  [USA],"We reserved AirBNB in Newark for a week.  Our flight was delayed, our luggage was delayed, and we were stuck on the freeway for over an hour.  We didn't arrive at the AirBNB until 1:30am.  When we tried the code the host gave us, it didn't work.  I tried messaging and calling the host, no answer.  Contacted Airbnb and they made us wait to see if they could contact the host.  At 3am, Airbnb gave up and told us to get a hotel room.  We walked over half a mile to a hotel  (after 3am!) and finally got to sleep around 5am.  Needless to say, I was super stressed and the first day of our trip was ruined.  The host messaged me at 6:30am with an alternate code and a message saying, ""I'm so sorry.""  This was 3 days ago.  We've since booked another place and Airbnb covered the cost of the hotel room for us, but it was still a crappy experience and we're staying in a worse location.  I feel like the host just screwed up, which happens, but man it sucked.  How many stars should I give?

TLDR - host gave us wrong code, so we had to cancel and stay somewhere else, which was a headache.  What kind of review should I leave?

Airbnb,Are we strange AirBnB host? New to hosting and have our questions.,"\--- Long --- Sorry...  
  
I just lost my job last month. So to take some of the sting out of it while I look for a new job I put 3 of the rooms in our house up on AirBnB. You have to understand I bought a huge historic house that needs a LOT of work (that is how I could afford it), just before I lost my job.  
  
The guest rooms have all been painted, all new beds and bedding. About 50% of the common areas have a fresh coat of paint. The bathroom well it is more dormitory style (long story) but we do our best to keep it spotless. I was working on restoring the house before all this happened.  
  
When our guest arrive we greet them at the door and offer to take their bags up for them. We have a personalized letter and a gift (a clear beach candle that we made) in the room. We take them on a tour of they house from top to bottom ending back at the room.  
  
During the stay we give the gest some space but also treat them like family. Some of the things we have done:  


Gave a personalized tour of the town we are in.  
  
Watched a guest youtube videos while he told us about them.  
  
Watched a movie with a guest (he had been traveling around the US by him self and was lonely).  
  
Sat down and had coffee with a guest and let them tell us about them self for an hour.  
  
Served them ice cream.  
  
After the stay I use the proceeds to make improvements to the house and send them pics of the funds went too. We also personally clean each room, washing EVERY thing to make sure the next guest gets a spotless clean room.  
  
We have not had that many guest yet. That being said we have a solid 5 star reviews. Every guest that has stayed with us raved about how they where treated and said they where coming back. Our last guest (from a law firm) said from now on their law firm is only going to be using us when they need a place to stay or need to put a client up when they are in this town. Matter of fact they all ready did a repeat booking for this Tuesday for a week.  
  
We did have 2 inquires about living situation here. Yes I am up front, we have 5 kids, 2 cats and a dog. Along with 1.5 shared bathrooms (the family uses them too). It is on the listing and I am very up front about it. Then it is a 8,000 sq ft house with 12 bed rooms. So far one of our guest has seen a cat for 5 min and another guest stayed here 2 days before she saw one of our kids and did not realize we even had cats. It seems that any one that gives us a chance loves it here and any one that inquires about the place I never here back from.  
  
\--- All this being said ---  
  
I have only stayed at one AirBnB in my life. Never meet the host, every thing was done with messages. The place was real nice but just did not feel lived in. I watch youtube videos on AirBnB and it seems people are buying houses and setting them up for a businesses. Here it seems all the stays are cold and impersonal.  
  
Every guest we have stay with us we kill ourselves to make them feel at home. Sort of like staying with your long lost family that you never had.  
  
My question is are we doing it wrong? Should we be taking a more hands off approach? Are we going to come across as creepy in the long run? We been told we are like staying at a loved grandparents house and it is the most family friendly environment they have ever seen. Not knowing anything about running a AirBnB I still have my questions. If I should be cold and not caring I do not think I can keep running a AirBnB. I do have to admit that I do care about the people that stay here.",68,218,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/14p8tp2/are_we_strange_airbnb_host_new_to_hosting_and/,2023-07-03 04:28:59,Airbnb
Airbnb,Can you live in an Airbnb temporarily? [USA] ,"
Im afraid I might be getting evicted from my apartment. I’m a college student living with my parents but I become the income provider a year ago due to my dad losing his job and is ill. Currently, he is in no condition to work. However, I was unaware that we were behind on all the bills when he lost his job, so I had to step up. At one point I was working two jobs but quit one of them because they were treating me so poorly and they weren’t giving any hours. So now, I work as a server and I’ve been handling the bills with a job where the income is inconsistent. My mother on the hand refuses to work, up until now. I sent messages to my landlord about our situation, she was lenient at first but now she grew tired and is sending a whole bunch of messages about the rent.

Airbnb,Due to hurricanes in Florida I have been living in Airbnbs for the past several weeks.  I have some suggestions/feedback that are small touches that would go a long way.[USA],"Please provide hangers in the closets.  I am on my 3rd one that only had 4 or 5 hangers, and these were wire leftover dry cleaning hangers, or child size hangers.

Also, a few lamps would be helpful.  Bedrooms without some type of small night table and lamp is so frustrating.  In the current home the living room has no lamps, just the overhead light (and its very dim).  No chance of reading in the living room at all.

Stocking the kitchen with at least a roll of foil or plastic wrap would be a nice touch.  

Invest in at least a mid range grade of towels rather than the lowest quality, thinnest, smallest bath towels.

We are not demanding folks at all, but these are small things that would have made our long term stays a little more comfortable.

Edit - one more - Drawers!  Even if just cheap plastic bins…. None of these we have stayed in have any dressers/drawers, so we have literally been living out of a suitcase for 3 weeks.  We ended up taking over an unused bedroom and spreading our clothes out all over the bed.

Airbnb,Host said they need to do Airbnb inspection 3 days after we arrived. Trying to force entry,"A few days into our month long stay, the host called and said they need to do a 6 month airbnb inspection. My partner and I thought we should confirm this and called Airbnb and asked if there was a 6 month inspection they requested. They said there was nothing on their end, but I can ask the host for evidence of an email or document requesting the inspection. So I messaged host on Airbnb asking for this. Host replied saying my partner said it was no problem (a lie) and that it wasn't for airbnb, it's for him. He then proceeded to blow up our phone. I knew everything needed to go through the app so we didn't pick up anymore. He says he needs to get an inspector in and now says its for Airbnb safety issues and that he needs to make sure the Airbnb is safe. I asked why this wasn't done before our arrival and what the safety concerns are. He wouldn't answer. Just saying its his house not ours and by law we have to let them in. I let him know we aren't wanting people showing up because we expected a private stay while we are here. He then calls us weird and odd for not saying ok to this inspection and that everyone else is ok with inspections. I let him know the reasons we aren't comfortable. He doesn't care. And when I call Airbnb they tell me if I'm not comfortable with it I don't have to let people in. That their policy is that we have to give permission or there has to be an emergency. Host says the law is on his side. 
I did a search and come to find out the home is for sale. Which the host never disclosed. We opened a case but we are at a loss of what to do. This host has made us uncomfortable and we didn't expect to have to deal with people coming during our stay.

Airbnb,AirBnB is refusing to honor their Extenuating Circumstances policy,"I scheduled a trip to Paris with my family (wife + 2 kids) for March 9 - 16. Today is March 8th. We woke up to this news.

Riots and civil unrest.

To be clear, I stand with the people of Paris. I take no issue with the strike. However, I have young children and I'd rather not be in Paris while this is going on.

This morning, I requested a refund from the host. They refused. I then requested a refund from AirBnB. I pointed out their extenuating circumstances policy, which I have pasted below. It is available for all to see at [https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1320](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/1320).

From the policy:

""This Extenuating Circumstances Policy explains how cancellations are handled when unforeseen events beyond your control arise after booking and make it impracticable or illegal to complete your reservation. This Policy applies to reservations for both accommodations and Experiences.

**When this Policy allows for cancellation, it controls and takes precedence over the reservation’s** [**cancellation policy**](https://www.airbnb.com/home/cancellation_policies)**. Guests that are impacted by an event covered by this Policy can cancel their reservation and receive, depending on the circumstances, a cash refund, travel credit, and/or other consideration.** Hosts that are impacted by an event covered by this Policy can cancel [without adverse consequences](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/990/as-a-host-what-penalties-apply-if-i-cancel-a-reservation-for-a-stay), but, depending on the circumstances, their calendars may be blocked for the dates of the cancelled reservation.""

The above text clearly states that ""this Policy allows for cancellation, it controls and takes precedence over the reservation’s [cancellation policy](https://www.airbnb.com/home/cancellation_policies).""  and ""Guests that are impacted by an event covered by this Policy can cancel their reservation and receive, depending on the circumstances, a cash refund, travel credit, and/or other consideration.""

Among the events covered are the following:

""Military actions and other hostilities. Acts of war, hostilities, invasions, civil war, terrorism, explosions, bombings, rebellions, **riots**, insurrection, **civil disorder**, and **civil unrest**.""

I have spent the last 9 hours chatting and talking with AirBnB and so far, they refuse to follow their own Extenuating Circumstances policy.

Between the fees, the poor customer service, and now their refusal to follow their own policies, why would anyone book with AirBnB?

\*\*\* Update \*\*\*

I spent over 9 hours of chats and calls trying to get AirBnB to do the right thing and follow their own policy.

7 minutes after posting a link to this Reddit post to my AirBnB chat thread, I got a full refund.

The takeaway from this is to avoid spending too much time calling or chatting with AirBnB. Post to Reddit, call them on their bullshit and publicly shame them.

Airbnb,AirBnB cancelled our reservation while we were already checked in and won't give us a refund. Please help us [Canada].,"We urgently need help with our Airbnb reservation. We booked a 7-week stay from September to October back in May, and we’ve already paid for the first 30 days. On the second night of our stay, Airbnb sent us a message at 4 AM stating that we had to vacate the property because ""Airbnb is unable to support this reservation."" Thirty minutes later, we received another message labeled as a ""final attempt to contact,"" though it was the first time we had been informed of any issue. This caused us to miss work while trying to resolve the matter.

Airbnb did not provide an explanation until 18 hours later, citing a safety issue without offering further details. The listing is now active on the Airbnb website, but we haven’t received any clear answers. We have not been refunded, nor has our reservation been reinstated. Fortunately, the host has kindly allowed us to stay while we continue to sort things out with Airbnb.

Initially, Airbnb asked us to leave to allow them to investigate, and we complied. However, with no progress, the host allowed us to return. Now, Airbnb has restarted the investigation and closed our previous case because we are back in the property. We’ve explained that finding another listing in this small town is nearly impossible at a similar price. Airbnb initially offered compensation for 3 nights in a hotel (with a price limit), but it’s been seven days, and we’ve been unable to get an update from anyone handling our case. We also don’t have the funds to rebook elsewhere since Airbnb hasn’t refunded us.

Over the past week, we’ve called multiple times a day, only to be transferred between agents with no resolution. Every agent tells us there is no refund process for this reservation in our account. When we express our frustration, they promise to escalate the case, but there’s no way to contact the ""specialized team"" handling it. We’ve been promised a call or email within 24 hours, but this has not happened for several days. The most recent message came from a new agent at 4 AM, despite our repeated requests for contact during reasonable hours due to work commitments. Our case has also been canceled several times without our consent, forcing us to restart the process each time.

We are in a dire situation. We can’t continue living in limbo, and we may be forced to leave if the host changes their mind. When a ""specialized team member"" does reach out, it’s always between 3-4 AM, with no further contact during the day, which is impossible for us to manage. We are pleading for help. Please assist us in resolving this matter.",47,59,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1fcxj3j/airbnb_cancelled_our_reservation_while_we_were/,2024-09-09 19:07:08,Airbnb

Airbnb,Please HELP! My vehicle was stolen at an Airbnb property [USA],"I need any help possible. I have cried so long about this and I feel like I’m getting nowhere. I stayed at an Airbnb property in Houston for two nights. When I woke up at 4 AM to pack my car and head home, my vehicle was missing from the Airbnb property. I called the police and tried to contact the property manager. Once the police got there, I filed a report and the property manager finally came outside. He had been watching me cry about my vehicle being stolen the whole time but would not come outside. I noticed there were cameras pointed at the walkways and told the officer who then requested the footage. The property manager said he didn’t have access to the cameras. I said fine but asked to speak with the property owner to receive the footage. At this point I had to book a flight to head back home (4 states over) and I am immobile. When the property owner finally reached out to me, he said he couldn’t help me and that I should reach out to Airbnb for any further help. When I asked for the tapes, he refused to release it to me or Houston PD. This happened two weeks ago. Over the last two weeks I have been playing phone tag with Airbnb Support requesting for them to help remedy the situation and get the tapes for me. Their solution has been to offer me $500 for an $8,000 vehicle that contained all of my dance supplies, work tools, personal information, and some clothing. And, they have purposely decided to not answer any questions about the tapes. At this point I don’t know what to do. I have requested additional support or a supervisor but I keep getting the same roundabout answers. I just graduated college and my car was the only source of income. I have received no help from Airbnb and I don’t know who else to reach out to.

Airbnb,I think I may have uncovered just how fraudulent and misleading AirBnb is by accident,"In a nutshell, I stayed at a bungalow overnight which was completely misrepresented and disgusting. I chose to leave a mixed review, giving some feedback on possible repairs that need to occur. I left it at that, learnt my lesson and moved on. That was until the host decided to publicly attack my character on my review, and subvert issues. I was slightly perturbed, so hit the request a refund button, which was declined by host but gave option to put case to AirBnB.

This is where things got interesting. I was called by a consultant, I sent through multiple pictures of large holes, missing light bulbs, missing fixtures, proof that bungalow was in fact a cabin amongst others (not private, secluded blah blah), surface’s literally caked in dust, you get my picture. 

They then started insisting that I was outside of the 72 hour aircover policy and no refund was able to be given, I asked if they planned on talking to host about misleading people and they said no. I was getting nowhere with her, and she obviously had her pre prepared responses ready to fire, so I asked if I was able to settle the matter with a supervisor or manager. I was told this was impossible, but they will raise a ticket and I will be rung in the next three hours. 

Four days later and I noticed I got a generic response from supervisors email, followed by one a minute later closing my case. I hadn’t spoken to them, voiced my concerns or had a chance to argue my case. The app leads you to contact host, which I did, I followed the most logical escalation pathway. 

I then rang them back, spoke to someone who said it was impossible to speak to a supervisor and they’ll raise a ticket. Same thing, received an email from same generic account and ticket closed. 

At this point I was typing messages stating just how they are in breach of Australian consumer regulations, and the hosts listing still unchanged despite photographic evidence of false advertising, etc. they just kept closing tickets. 

I naturally found this very odd, how are they so fragrantly able to provide services in Australia, but not act within their regulations? I kept asking, and now the manager was getting irate, telling me that there are previous good reviews and mine must be false, I’ve only been a member since such and such. As these emails were coming through I decided it was my chance to actually speak to the supervisor, so I rang and I explained the supervisor is literally emailing me right now, surely you have a messaging system to let them know I’m on the phone and wanting to be transferred. The man just kept telling me that this is impossible. I then asked “I’m a bit confused, what is your corporate structure, who do you even report to if you can’t contact a manager?” He told me that information is private, I told him it’s not and he knows it, I could literally google it as it has to be public knowledge and he could save both our time by just telling me. I asked him his name, I was getting frustrated with these pre-prepared responses. He replied with his name, and asked if I could hold while he “reviewed my case”. While I was on hold I decided to skim over what the supervisor had emailed me, to my surprise it was signed by a name that was very similar to the one I was just provided. After I was taken off hold I asked him how he spelt his name, it was the same spelling. 

What followed was an absolute shambles. I said “…..you’re the one who has been emailing me…” he responded affirmatively. I preceded to ask “if you’re the manager, who the hell were you going to get to contact me……”, silence. 

I burst out laughing in absolute disbelief and said “…….this whole system is just designed to piss people off until they give up, you take the calls, tell people they’ll be contacted by a supervisor, but you know that’s not true”. The poor guy was shell shocked and now giving me options, who I wanted to speak to, what type of manager, I had my pick. I kindly asked that as a supervisor, he could arrange my refund and we can leave it at that. He agreed.

Today I was contacted by email by another supervisor defending reasons not to refund me and attack my claims. I rang them, they record all phone calls with no option to opt out, so when this allegedly real supervisor answered I informed him that I would also be recording phone call. He told me I wasn’t authorised and must cease recording to continue phone call. I laughed and said “yeah, right” which he took as yes. 

To say the least, it was a very interesting phone call. I said my request was simple enough, the issue really is your fraudulent little call centre operation. I said I was prepared to compile all recordings, correspondence and draft a letter with a distribution list containing emails of multiple banks, regulatory agencies, government bodies and hotel lobby groups, as they were now really pissing me off. He freaked, begged me not to as he was so concerned I’d be wasting my precious time. I told him not to worry, I had compiled and drafted everything and formed a distribution list and Dropbox. He got angry, “why would you do that!”, “because you won’t refund me, wasted my time arguing with me and also accidentally revealed their whole scam customer service resolution centre business model”. 

He was very angry, told me he spoke on behalf of Airbnb, whilst also voicing their very dodgy, hidden practices and basically stiff cheese, no $167 refund for you, also told me I have no evidence so they don’t care. I then wrapped it up, telling him I was disappointed that we couldn’t work things out, thanked him for providing such a candid insight into the machinations of AirBnB and I was glad to have heard it all from someone authorised to speak on AirBnBs behalf. I then let him know that I recorded conversation for quality and training purposes. 

He was furious, demanding I delete recording as I wasn’t authorised by AirBnB to record phone calls. I asked if he could refer me to their specific policy, as their policies are a mess. He kept demanding, I kept declining. He hung up and sent me an email outlining that I’m working outside of AirBnBs authority. 

I guess my question is, is this well known and documented? Or have I accidentally uncovered a scam by insisting on a refund. I avoid AirBnB like I avoid Uber, unfortunately this particular accommodation directed bookings through AirBnB, so yeah.

Airbnb,Leaving feedback for a NYC AirBnB in the app [USA],"I understand that NYC cracked down on the rentals recently. I just stayed at an AirBnB which is clearly also a personal residence in NYC and I'm in the process of writing a review. No major complaints about the overall stay or the apartment itself, but when I checked in, the host asked me to change my reservation to 1 guest for 1 night (we were 4 guests staying 2 nights) which prompted AirBnB to issue me an immediate refund. And then he asked me to pay him that difference instead over Venmo. I think he gave me a small discount for doing this.

I kind of understand the logic behind it, but I don't appreciate being put on the spot to do it that way in the moment. I'm considering mentioning it in my review, but I wasn't sure if maybe this was just something that is now widely accepted?

Airbnb,AirBnB Host Didn't Let Me Know Hot Tub was Broken,"I'm pretty mad.

I booked an AirBnB for me and two girlfriends for my birthday weekend, which also happens to be a long weekend in Canada. We booked a YEAR in advance (around my birthday LAST year) and our only requirements when looking were something waterfront, and something with a hot tub.

I've checked their listing multiple times in the last year and nothing has changed on it. There is a note that we need to request the hot tub in advance so I sent them a message yesterday letting them know how excited we were and that we would will be wanting to use the hot tub. They let me know the hot tub is closed for the summer months as guests normally don't want to use it, and that it actually needs repairs.

WHAT?! Why wouldn't they let us know as soon as it stopped working (they told me it broke down in April and they were having trouble finding someone to repair it since it's 15 years old). I told them to please keep looking for someone to repair, and that I was disappointed it wasn't mentioned sooner as it's now virtually impossible to find another airbnb for that weekend. They have read it and haven't responded.

I'm tempted to send them a link to an inflatable hot tub from Rona for less than $1000 (which is literally covered by our stay over one weekend). Thoughts on this? I feel like it should be their responsibility to make this right... but I know AirBnB won't have our backs. They probably know that, even if we DO end up going this weekend (which we'll probably have to, since, again, nothing else available in our budget for a holiday long weekend less than a month in advance), they won't be getting a good review, so they have no reason to go out of their way.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Just got off the phone with AirBnB Support. Since I messaged the hosts, they have revised their listing to say ""Hot Tub Available Seasonally from Nov - March"", which made me pretty upset since that was NOT there when we booked. Luckily, the support member on the phone said they have access to the listing as it was on the day we booked it, and they can see that the Hot Tub was clearly listed as an amenity.

They are going to contact the hosts and see if they can get the hot tub fixed by July 1. If not, hopefully we can reach a resolution (nightly discount / comparable stay?). I just don't want them to cancel the booking and for us to have nowhere to go.

**More:** On the phone the first time with AirBnB, the support agent said they could offer a full refund and a 20% off coupon that would apply to my next stay. The host also offered $100 off the stay.",378,84,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/147tq4a/airbnb_host_didnt_let_me_know_hot_tub_was_broken/,2023-06-12 18:16:50,Airbnb

Airbnb,I have stayed at over 100 Airbnbs around the world. Potential & Current Hosts AMA [USA],"For the last few years, I have been (almost) living in Airbnbs as I traveled around the world. After arriving at my last Airbnb and given my experience, the Host mentioned I could help potential and current hosts with their Airbnbs. My current host today told me I had 99 reviews, so this stay will be review #100. I had no clue I'd racked up that many. Given the occasion, I figured let's see if I can be helpful!

There are plenty of 'Airbnb host experts' out there - but very, very, very few with as much as experience as a guest. So AMA!

A few ideas that come to mind on what hosts could do better to make the experience nicer -

\* Listing - if there other rooms guests may be in, make sure you say that in the listing. Multiple times I've arrived at a property to realize it has a few guests staying there or is basically a hostel.

\* Messages prior to arrival - weather! I've never had a host give me a heads up about the current weather, and that would have been incredibly helpful in many experiences when I was packing. Example - in the Netherlands, the forecast may not say rain, but you better be prepared as it seemed to rain almost every day I was there.

\* Make sure the address # to your property is incredibly easy to see from the road. Many homes have the home numbers in the bushes or on a column or on the building somewhere difficult to find. It's a simple thing that just makes locating the property easier to find.

\* Parking - a simple map of where a guest can park will make the arrival process easier.

\* Cleaning - around the baseboards, blinds, shades. One particular property comes to mind. The owner did the cleaning themselves, and the baseboards had been neglected, it appeared, for years. So much dust and dirt just sitting there that the host never noticed.

\* Kitchens - wooden / silicone cooking utensils. How many times do you get to a property and the pans have been scratched beyond belief? Now I know this doesn't prevent people from using forks and knives in skillets, but the amount of people that put metal cooking tools in the kitchens are still the norm. Save yourself some money by making your pots and pans last as long as possible.

\* Kitchens - regularly throw out spices and condiments left by guests. These seem to multiply over time, but rarely get thrown out. Make sure to just throw them away every few months as that pepper is now 2 years old, the thyme is from 2016, and olive oil that is well past the use by date.

\* Kitchens - storage containers. If your guests are likely to stay for a period of time, having some storage containers can be a nice thing to have as guests cook and have left overs. Very, very, very few actually have any.

\* On the topic of oils, its always handy to have those easily visible when a guest first arrives. On more than one occasion, I've bought a bottle of olive oil, only to realize there was a bottle in the kitchen - but in a cabinet.

\* Kitchen - stove top vs hot plate. Several times lately, the listing says there is a kitchen - only to realize it is a portable hot plate. If you are using hot plates, just say so.

\* Guides - where are publicly accessible toilets in your area? Everyone wants to share the restaurants and things to do... but where are the local toilets?? When guests are out and about, knowing where a quick restroom is can make life so much easier.

\* Local doctor  - In case a guest needs to visit a doctor, having a list of doctors/ travel medicine offices can be a huge help.

\* If your town or region expects you to have tissues on hand (thinking parts of Europe), the little 10 packs are a nice thing to have for guests (so they aren't left without toilet paper when out and about). Super cheap, but a life saver when nature calls.

\* Public transportation - should I buy a metro card? For cities with great public transportation, having a simple guide on the type of metro card to get can be a nice touch. Some cities have mobile credit card payment where you don't need to get a card. Other towns, a card is a handy way to see the area while saving money. Just letting the guest know will make their experience a bit nicer.

Those are a bunch of ideas of the top of my head. If you have any questions, I will answer them over the next 24 hours.

EDIT:

Soaps / Detergents - make sure to just top those off. Several times I've shown up where the host doesn't check the hand soap, shower gel or dish soap, and they are empty/ soon  to be empty. Get huge container, and just add to the list - check and and refill.

  
Trash - having clear instructions on where guests can take the trash. If your area has separate recycling rules (Glass, paper, Plastic, etc), have instructions and places to put those things. Also where can a guest take those bags? So many times I have needed to take out the trash, and not known where to take it. For example, a town I was just in wanted you to separate the colored glass vs white glass. No problem with that, but where do I throw that away? It was a mile away. Without a car, I carried the glass to throw out because I was staying there a year and didn't want to keep looking at the bottles piling up.

Airbnb,Should I mention these issues to the Airbnb host [USA],"We stayed in a cabin type place in the woods. All in all, it was very nice, except for a few very minor issues. I was considering telling the host about these minor issues, but We stayed in a cabin type place in the woods. 

One issue, that he probably won’t notice, is there was no hairdryer. Not a biggie, but it’s mentioned in the amenities for the place, and if the next person looks for a hairdryer, and there is none, they might be disappointed. I was slightly disappointed, but I’m not fussy about my hair these days. Also, I don’t want the host thinking that we stole it. A few lightbulbs in both of the bathrooms were burned out. Luckily there was still enough functioning lightbulbs, that it was not an issue, we were still able to see. But I feel like I should tell the host about this, but again, my better half seems to think that he will figure out himself. Speaking of the bathroom, one of the toilet seats was cracked, the very front metal part, the part goes between your legs, I guess. I mean, depending, I guess it possibly could pinch somebody’s skin if they move a certain way on the toilet seat. But, I don’t want the host thinking that we cracked the toilet seat. Lastly, literally as we were packing up to leave, one of the smoke detectors started beeping. I was going to tell the host, but again my better half seems to think that the host will figure out himself. 

 Edit: I forgot to add, we had to do a small load of laundry. There was a bunch of white towels, that was still in the dryer. We put them back in the dryer when we were done with our laundry. I sent him a second message, about the towels. It indicates he read these messages, but has not replied yet.

Airbnb,AirBnb Host charged $600 for damages; are they over quoting?,"We recently rented a lake house in MO for a group get together and after we returned, the host sent me a $600 charge for a stained twin sized comforter/pillow ($100) and a dent in the wall ($500) that presumably came from a bunk bed rocking into the drywall. The wall wasn’t broken through and the comforters seemed to be on the less expensive end; so I was wondering whether the damage charge is being over quoted regardless of whether a member of the group created the damage or not.

Edit: I love seeing the assumptions of sex on the bunk bed lol. There was only one guest from our group that stayed on the bunk bed alone but he was the smallest of everyone and no one else noticed the dent when cleaning up before checking out. 

When the host sent me a photo of the damage, there was already a previous patched spot right next to and much larger than the dent presumably from our group.",143,155,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/13imvao/airbnb_host_charged_600_for_damages_are_they_over/,2023-05-15 22:32:50,Airbnb
Airbnb,Additional Rules Compromising AirBnB Stay [USA],"Hey everyone, my fiancé and I have a wedding this Saturday and we booked a large mansion for our wedding party to stay at together close to our venue. In the reviews for this AirBnB many others talk about staying at this location for their wedding weekend.

Yesterday, we received an email about additional house rules not listed in the description or rules section on the AirBnB listing. The rules that stood out to me were “any guest not listed or staying at the AirBnB visiting for any duration of time will be a $50 charge per guest per day.” This means that if a family member shows up to visit we could be hit with a fine per person. In the description this was much more vague stating any person not listed as a guest would be a $25 additional charge per night if they stay the night. 

Another rule in this additional rule section is banning alcohol. This was not listed anywhere in the description on the AirBnB website and bans any alcohol in the stay. I really cannot believe that other people staying here for weddings didn’t have a drop of alcohol. We are by no means throwing a party here, but would casually drink and hangout by the fire pit and hot tub this stay offers.

Not sure what to do at this point and have never had this happen. This email was sent two days after the cancellation date.",40,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1f1pecb/additional_rules_compromising_airbnb_stay_usa/,2024-08-26 14:20:59,Airbnb

Airbnb,Host contacted us outside of Airbnb and wants us to cancel [USA],"I booked an Airbnb about a month ago for mid January. Yesterday I got a call from a person claiming to be the host. I have no way to verify who they actually were. They had a story about them getting a notice from the sheriffs office that they can no longer operate the Airbnb that I had booked. 

They said that I needed to cancel my trip and that since they feel so bad for this they have another rental that isn’t on Airbnb that they would rent to me instead. I explained that I have no way to know if this person is really the host and asked them to cancel me and I would find other accommodations. They said they can’t host cancel.  I said no problem I will just message you through the Airbnb platform and confirm everything we have said before I cancel. That’s when they said that we can not mention them contacting us outside Airbnb or asking us to cancel. They said they would just send us a message that says happy holidays to confirm that it was them that I was talking to. 

The message they sent said happy holidays and we can’t wait to host you. 

I asked Airbnb and they said if the host cant accommodate any longer the host will need to cancel. 

So is this a scam? Should I just cancel? Should I report them?",41,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1h7qkgj/host_contacted_us_outside_of_airbnb_and_wants_us/,2024-12-06 02:13:18,Airbnb
Airbnb,"Booked an AirBnB 4 months ago, AirBnB decided to raise the price $3,076.55 to $10,112.21","Booked an AirBnB 4 months ago for Coachella (3 nights), for $3,076.55

This week we were told by AirBnB Support staff that they need to cancel the reservation in order to raise the price lol

The new price: $10,112.21

[https://imgur.com/a/vbn908n](https://imgur.com/a/vbn908n)

The host didn't even reach out or contact us at all... was only notified by AirBnB support.

FWIW, a hotel has never cancelled on me to raise the price 3x

\---

EDIT:

I think the lesson to be learned here is that Instant Bookings from AirBnB aren't fully protected, as the host has 3 Instant Bookings a year they can cancel without penalty. If this was a regular booking, AirBnB policy (I believe) is to disallow the host from relisting the property during the dates they cancelled on you.

I think the problem here is that the host waited 4 months to cancel their Instant Booking, which doesn't make sense to me. Instant Booking policies should probably turn into regular booking policies after 1 month from the booking date. It doesn't seem right that they can use the Instant Booking policies after 4 months from the reservation.

Also AirBnB could do a better job at making it clear that you're less protected as a guest when doing Instant Bookings, below support article for Instant Book only mentions the positives, none of the negatives. Only the host version of the instant book feature really explains the power they have over bookings.

Airbnb,"Airbnb cancelled a guest after he checked in. Because I have auto-booking, another guest then booked but first guest refused to leave.","This just happened last night. A person booked for a room and checked in. Later on in the evening Airbnb canceled his reservation. I was out and didn't find out until an hour later when I saw the notification. They told me he may have breached their terms of service so they were canceling the booking. While I was out, someone else booked the room because now that the reservation was cleared it showed available on the listing. The new guest messaged me for check in instructions. So I got home quickly to find that the guest who had been canceled was still there and refusing to leave because Airbnb had not refunded his money. I confirmed this with Airbnb that they would not talk to him about a possible refund until he left. So the cancelled guest said he was not leaving and I could call the police if I wanted to. I said to him I want you to leave and I'm requesting you to leave but I will not call the police. So he stayed and the other guest had to find another place to stay. Strangely enough Airbnb did not cancel the other guest's reservation who could not stay. She is now asking for me to cancel the reservation. I told her I could not cancel or I would lose my super host status and be penalized but that if she would like, she could stay the rest of her reservation. I also assured her that Airbnb would certainly refund her. She doesn't seem to understand that but this is where I'm at. I guess I need to change my booking availability settings so that a room cannot be booked after a check in time so this doesn't happen again.

Airbnb,Host requesting for reimbursement for water damage due to open freezer door and ice melting that occured after we checked out. Who will airbnb side with? [USA],"For context, we [USA] stayed in an airbnb [USA]. My sister bought an ice cream and kept it in the freezer. On our day of checkout, we cleaned out the fridge and freezer of our items like usual. Being an ice cream, my sister grabbed it out of the freezer at the last moment of us leaving the apartment at 10 AM (the posted checkout time). We messaged the host at 10 AM that we checked out and left. 

2 days later, i get an email from airbnb with the host requesting 15k for water damage on the kitchen floor due to the freezer melting. Host wrote that she discovered it at 6:30 pm (8.5 hrs after we checked out). The entire apartment floor needs to be replaced since it was a continuous vinyl flooring. The host sent pictures of the freezer door several inches open, a puddle, and some of the kitchen floor warping. (The host also oddly wrote in her message asking if this was intentional?? I'm mind boggled.)

 I understand that my sister could have possibly not notice that she didn't push the freezer door all the way. My sister says she remembers pushing the door in. It was definitely not several inches wide open. So if the freezer door did slide open further, it would have been after we left and we would not have known. The fridge seemed old, definitely not new. So I'm not sure if it had the function to self close. I understand that if this happened during our stay, we could be responsible. But this happened as we checked out and obviously we were not coming back. Is this something airbnb can make us pay for?

Edit: thank you for all the responses. This is my first time in all the years as an airbnb user encountering this kind of situation so it's a learning process. 

UPDATE: on 8/15, airbnb decided to charge me $1800 for the damage. I tried another appeal but that failed and it looks I cannot appeal again.

Also is Airbnb not allowed to explain the breakdown of cost or send an itemized invoice? I've emailed the resolution team multiple times and they just replied with a generic response telling me to read the policy terms and that they cannot share any info that was sent to them by the host. Is this something I have to get from the host directly? I just want to be sure that 1800 is actually going into the repairs and not being used for other means.

Airbnb,FYI: AirBnB will ban your entire family if you have a relative with a criminal record. [USA],"About a month ago, I made a reservation for my mother's trip to Bali. (I have a long-standing account that I have used in the past when we travel together, and she's not very tech-savvy.) The other day I get an e-mail stating that the deposit for my rental had been refunded. I go to log in to see why the reservation was cancelled and am faced with a screen saying that due to random background checks my ""account has been removed."" I figure I don't have time to go through whatever appeals process they have so I tell my mom that she will need to make her own account and make a new reservation. I slowly step her through the process of setting up her account. We find the property she had her heart set on staying at for the last 2 years (they recently had a cancellation that coincidentally lined up with her vacation so she was super excited to be able to snag it up.) She goes all the way through the reservation process and as soon as she submits payment the screen goes blank and she gets an error screen every time she tries to log in. After trying repeatedly to figure out how to get support for being unable to login, since you have to login to get support, I have the idea of her messaging their Facebook page. They ask questions, chat back and forth a few times, then tell her they will get back to her.  
The next day they message her and tell her she has been banned because ""you are closely related to someone who is not allowed to use our services."" The decision is final. There can be no appeal.

So, apparently, if a member of your family flags on their background checks for whatever reason they will ban everyone in your family. My appeal appears to be stuck in an endless loop, and I would go the route of contacting them through Facebook, but I'm guessing it's no use because they have already decided that our entire family are scum that they don't want to do business with and we still have no idea why.

Just a heads up to anyone planning a trip who has an ex-con in the family, or their computers think you do, because you might find yourself and your family removed from the service.

Thanks for giving your competitors our business from now on. It's just too bad that a couple of our favorite places to stay are only on AirBnB. Although, after I contact those hosts to let them know why the reservation was cancelled and why we won't be able to visit in the future, perhaps they will start using other services from now on. It's sad. I was pretty proud of my glowingly positive reviews and had dozens of places saved in my favorites that I planned on staying at in the future but have no way of finding again now.

That, and the fact that Airbnb doesn't bother to monitor this sub and offer support to the people who are driven here by the bad app support personnel aka Deter and Deflect Team have also contributed.

I've had some good experiences and enough borderline ones to now prefer the predictability of hotels and, in Europe, traditional and well-established guest houses.

Airbnb,Unsure what to do after staying in an AirBnB that clearly broke the rules,"TL;DR: Stayed in an AirBnB, had a perfectly pleasant time, but unknowingly ended up in a likely illegal short term rental and are conflicted about whether to report it. 

Recently stayed in an AirBnB in a major North-American city for 5 days. Everything was normal, until we got the check-in instructions that told us to go to a building half a block away, in the back alley, to get the key out of a lock-box. We were also told to not interact with anyone in the building, and if asked, to lie and say we were staying with a friend, who's name wasn't the host. 

We had other issues with the suite that were entirely out of the control of the host, so can't knock them for what was otherwise a perfectly fine experience. The hosts were a bit powerless, but were attentive and very communicative throughout. 

We're left feeling conflicted, as we were duped into staying in a suite that clearly wasn't allowed to be a short term rental, and likely isn't licensed by the city. This is in a ridiculously high COL city that has a major housing affordability problem. We're debating reporting them to AirBnB, but we're conflicted as it was otherwise a smooth experience and they were otherwise good hosts.",89,173,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/13g2mlr/unsure_what_to_do_after_staying_in_an_airbnb_that/,2023-05-13 00:54:50,Airbnb

Staying here a week and a bit grossed out [usa]","Update: I have a suspicion, as some of you did too, that the host doesn’t live here and just coordinates from somewhere else. She has quite a few listings here, but also in other cities. I messaged her about it, and she said she’d have necessities delivered, and mentioned her backup cleaner cleaned and this isn’t the first complaint she’s had about her. She offered to have her normal cleaners come by today, which works perfectly fine for us as we’re mostly just here to sleep. Since it’s close to the holidays, there isn’t really anywhere else nearby for us that isn’t double the price so we’ll stay. I appreciate all the advice! 

Staying in an Airbnb to visit family across the country. We got in at 3 for check in, and then ran to a family event and got back late with 2 overtired kiddos. 

The reviews for this place were really good, and we chose it based on that and the fact that it looked newly updated. Upon arriving I quickly noticed that it was just the “landlord special”, very poorly painted walls and cabinets. Oh well. I laid my son down on the carpet and there were chip (?) crumbs on it, but I assumed it was just a small spot that was missed. The furniture was all very cheap, but again, not a crime. 

When we returned this evening, I noticed the back door lock doesn’t work, neither does the deadbolt on the front door. There is another lock to the front, and for now we placed a stick in the tracks of the back door. 

There is no garbage bag in the trash, and despite the list saying there are extra under the sink, there are not. 

The fridge lights don’t work, and the handle to the washer (the one amenity I was excited for) is broken off. 

The sheets have hair on them that’s not ours, and the extra blankets have something spilled on them. 


One of the bathrooms has dirt all over the bath floor, old bars of soap on the shelves, and a grimey old body wash container. The sink has hair in it and is dirty. 

There is balled up (dirty?) clothing on the bedroom closet floor. 

Anyways, with the kids being exhausted (and one of them gone straight to bed), and an unexpected snow storm, we cannot leave tonight. 

 We are booked here for the entire week, but I’m grossed out and beyond annoyed. Is it reasonable to ask for the first night comped and a full refund? Or am I being absolutely nitpicky?

Airbnb,Why is it so hard to find an airbnb with a TV infront of the bed? [UK/Italy/France],"Every time me and my partner  are on airbnb looking for a place to stay during our travels our only requirements are tv in bedroom facing the bed, good location and bed frame. You'd be surprised how many don't even have bed frames either. Right now we are struggling with London. Our budget is about 150-200 euros per night. I feel like this is very reasonable and bare minimum, every hotel has this, is it that big of a problem to have a TV in the bed room? Is this something that's too expensive or complicated to set up? So many nice places that just decided to put the TV on the side of the room in the wall for no reason.

Airbnb,"Housekeeper from my previous airbnb [Italy] stay won't stop texting me, what do I do?","Update: I contacted Airbnb support, they said to just message the host again and tell her about this. The host said she didn’t know the housekeeper wrote to me again, and that she probably wanted me to know how much more she spent on laundry. She also said she’s going to request a refund from Airbnb through the insurance that covers damages and unexpected events. We didn’t damage anything but that’s her reply. 

Hi everyone, this has never happened to me before and I am not sure what to do. The housekeeper who gave us the key to the property and cleans the apartment keeps texting me about extra towels we used and I don't know if I should message the host to ask her to stop. 

\*For context\* I recently came back from an international trip to Italy and I stayed in an airbnb at a very small but touristy town for 3 days. The actual host of the home lives almost 2 hours away from the property so she has a housekeeper check the guests in, do the cleaning, etc. We got into the property 30 minutes after we were supposed to check in because the previous guests had a late check in which was fine but here is the main problem I'm having.

There were 2 plastic boxes in the bedroom that had a bunch of clean towels inside. The boxes weren't hidden away in a closet and there were no details in the listing or by the host that we had a limit on towels we could use. Since the town we stayed in had a beach, we visited it 2x and had brought extra towels with us. 2 to lay on and 2 to dry off from the water. The towels were still wet the following day when we visited the beach again so we got more, using 8 in total. The housekeeper also left us some on the bed for us to shower with (not for a beach).

When we left, we put a pile near the bathroom of all the towels so the housekeeper can just grab and go to wash for the next guest. A few hours after we left our stay, the housekeeper messaged me on WhatsApp asking why did we use so many towels, what did we use all the towels for, we should've left a tip or extra $$ for this cost and that this is going to cost us extra. 

I've stayed at airbnb's for years and have never had an issue with using extra towels. I didn't respond but I messaged the host and she said the housekeeper is extremely angry, we should've notified them we wanted to use extra towels and that this caused a difficulty in getting the house ready for the next guest (check was out 10 am, check in is at 5 pm for guests). The housekeeper messaged me again that night and said she is still waiting for a response from us with an eye roll emoji.

It's now been a week since we left the airbnb, I am back in the United States and the housekeeper just messaged me again with a picture of the receipt from how much the costs were (25 euros) and she said ""this is all it cost just to do laundry and I had to do 5 loads."" 

Should I just block her now on WhatsApp since we've gone from the property or do I notify the host she is still messaging me? I don't know what to do or if what we did was wrong by taking extra towels left in the bedroom?

Airbnb,Options after being locked IN an Airbnb [France],"A group of us recently stayed in an Airbnb in Cotignac France. On one of the days we woke up early to go to some adventuring. We got to the front door of the apartment building and realized it was locked. 

This was the only exit in the whole building, as it was a small apartment building with only 6 apartments. 

In France it seems they love doors that lock with a key from both sides, meaning the only way to unlock it is with said key. We were on the second floor and therefore had no safe way to exit this building.

Back home in Canada this would be a VERY big deal as the only exit is inaccessible.

We contacted the host immediately and after 20 minutes of back and forth troubleshooting. Including asking us to knock on the doors of the other apartments. But it turns out no one else was in this building. he then decided to make the 40 minute drive to come to the Airbnb.

He showed up with keys that unlock a mailbox inside, that supposedly had the key to the lock. However this was not the case and that key opened the wrong lock. Still locked in. 

It turns out he actually didn’t have a key for the second lock at all. And he told us we had to wait an hour and a half until some other tenant could show up and open the door for us.

All in, we were locked INSIDE of this Airbnb for about three hours. The host apologized and gave us a 15 euro bottle of wine as a “sorry” gift. We took it and quickly left because we had things to do.

After all this we reached out to him to ask for a partial (half) refund.  And he countered saying it wasn’t his responsibility and that he’d only give us 21 euros as compensation for the time we were locked in the Airbnb.

We think that’s totally outrageous, and am wondering what are options are. I don’t know anything about the building codes in France, but in Canada I would have called the emergency fire services and had them knock the door down.

He mentioned he was going to have a key made so this problem wouldn’t happen again. But what if a future guest gets locked in and has a medical emergency?

Airbnb,Unsustainable business model? What will happen to Airbnb? [WORLD],"We all know that Airbnb started off as a quick and easy way for rental owners or anyone having the right to access a property to profit from spare rooms or entire apartments. Hosts took advantages of the low entry barriers and fast cashflow (often difficult or impossible for local authorities to track) leading to more and more Airbnbs popping up in various cities, while travelers enjoyed cheaper, more “authentic” stays.

This rapid growth, which spanned over more than a decade and peaked between 2016 and 2020 pre-Covid, came at a cost. Major cities saw housing prices spike, rental stock shrink, and local cultures pushed aside by waves of short-term visitors, all partially tied to overtourism and gentrification.

In response, local governments have tightened rules around short-term rentals. Stricter registration systems, shorter rental periods, and heavier taxes are becoming common. Here are just a few examples:

* **New York** has cracked down on whole-apartment short-term stays.
* **Barcelona** plans to eliminate short-term rental apartments by 2028.
* **Italy** has recently banned self check-in and created a national database, requiring hosts to meet specific conditions to continue hosting.

With tougher regulations and higher barriers to entry, it is no longer as simple or profitable to host, especially now that the platform is saturated with competition - over 1,000 places often appear in even a single Airbnb search for most cities.

Here's what I'd like to discuss with the community:

* *Will it become too complicated and less convenient for hosts to continue operating under increasingly restrictive local regulations?*
* *As wealth inequality increases worldwide and flight tickets grow more expensive due to CO2 emissions, how will these changes in travel patterns impact short-term rentals?*
* *Will Airbnb shift its business model - perhaps by buying properties for full control over the guest experience and obligations, or by leaning more into long-term stays?*

What do you think the future holds for Airbnb? Can the platform adapt to survive these challenges, or are we seeing the beginning of its decline? Let’s discuss.",6,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1h9t70e/unsustainable_business_model_what_will_happen_to/,2024-12-08 21:22:17,Airbnb
Airbnb,Feeling conflicted about reporting an Airbnb that I’m staying in. WWYD?,"I’m staying in an Airbnb in a city that requires STRs to be the host’s primary residence. The host does not live here and the host said this to me in person. They live an hour away and they run many listings in the area (though mine is the only one of their listings in the city with the primary residence restriction). I would like to report the listing, as the rule exists to combat the housing crisis in this city, only to have the license revoked, but I don’t want the host to be charged with something serious, like felony fraud. When googling about STR primary residence rule violations for this city, there are articles of Airbnb hosts being charged with fraud for lying about their residence in this same city. 

What would you do?

EDIT: the attitude of some of the responses so far are really enlightening. If entitlement and a disregard for the community is an accurate reflection of what hosts think about the integrity of their business then I have no interest in trying to make sure there aren’t greater implications of a crime for this host. These rules were voted on by the people who live in this city and its leaders to protect the community, hosts included, and are there ensure people who live here have an actual place to live in. This city has a huge homeless problem - even right outside the steps of this Airbnb - and rents have almost doubled over the pandemic.

Airbnb,Nicest Airbnb host [Italy] ever… until he charged us $5k for a sofa bed that we ‘broke’.,"Checked into an Airbnb with 20 5-star reviews. Initially disappointing because the listing was quite misleading (said it was a 1-bed, it was actually a studio, said no steps, it had many steps), but the host was simply the nicest man and it seemed to make up for it. He delivered food gifts every day, was always checking in to see how we were going and offering local area tips. 

That is until we checked out and this request came through… 

We hadn’t been able to work out how to work the sofa bed on the first night, and sent him some ‘work in progress’ pics. He helped us, and we figured it out. But the bed was very saggy, and after a painful sleep we ended up taking the mattress off the bed and sleeping on it on the floor. Mentioned it to him with a photo, and now he’s claiming we damaged it and is charging $5k. He’s also asking $100 to replace the hinge on a cupboard door that broke when we were there, we messaged him at the time and he said it had happened a few times before and he’d fix it himself and not to worry, because it not Airbnb insurance would pay for it. 

Pretty stressed here given the amounts being requested, and wondering if anyone has experiences like this? We have a feeling he’s trying to game the insurance process, but don’t want to get caught up in these games.

Airbnb,Neglected animals at a recent airbnb stay [USA],"EDIT TO ADD: the amount of rage aimed at me is ridiculous. I reported my concerns to the host, the neighbors, and the property manager. I am now on reddit asking if I should report elsewhere. I am by no means COMPLICIT IN ANIMAL ABUSE THAT I AM TRYING TO RESOLVE.  The local authorities were already called and did nothing. So was trying to explore other options WHICH IS WHY I POSTED HERE. 

Now, as for WHY I LEFT A POSITIVE REVIEW. the house I stayed on was on acres and acres of land that happened to have a farm on it. My HONEST AND FAIR review was about the PROPERTY I STAYED ON NOT THE FARM. If my review was geared towards the farm, of course, I would have left a bad review. 

Recently I stayed at an airbnb on a farm. It was a really lovely property, but it was hard not to notice that the animals were in really poor condition. The host of the airbnb was not on-site, but there was a farmhand. The host was pretty difficult to get in touch with. Examples of the animal neglect:

There was an old pig that had what seemed to be a broken leg. It could not walk or move, and was bleeding out of it's mouth. When I mentioned this to the farmhand he just said the pig is old. 

There were multiple animals locked up with no food or water. I checked for 2 days and this was not resolved. I ended up giving the animals water myself. 

The horses were not let out of their stables for days, and we're banging their heads against the walls. 

The ferrets cage was flooding with water and clearly wasn't cleaned in a very long time. 

Initially I was just going to let this go, and perhaps say something to the host after I checked out. That was until I met the neighbor who said the animals are severely neglected ALWAYS and it's been an ongoing concern with neighbors and guests. When the neighbor has brought this up to the host, she mentions it to the farmhand who denies any issues and then yells at the neighbor. He asked that I say something because the situation is getting out of hand and he was hoping she would take my concerns seriously. Apparently the host does go to the farm occasionally and doesn't live that far. I'm guessing she either has no clue what is going on because the farmhand cleans up before she arrives, or she knows and doesn't care. I'm going to go with the latter because apparently animals services have been called on her in the past, plus you can't hide a pig with a broken leg. 

I ended up messaging the host and alerting her to my concerns (in a very polite way) and she said none of these things are of concern, and that the horses are banging their heads against the wall because of flies. I understand flies are a huge nuisance with horses, but that's why you get them the face coverings. 

In any case, I gave a great review because the property itself was really special, but I just can't stop thinking about those poor animals. 

Do you think I should contact someone, or just let it be and forget about it? ",16,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1g0bibc/neglected_animals_at_a_recent_airbnb_stay_usa/,2024-10-10 05:11:43,Airbnb

Airbnb,"Bugs under the bed, Airbnb refuses to give a refund","I booked an Airbnb for myself, spouse and in-laws. We checked in tonight, dropped off our bags and left for dinner. Upon returning and getting ready for bed we found a couple of dead bugs on the bed. No biggie - it’s an older house and it’s summer in the south. I brushed them off and kept going. My wife lifted her pillow and found a third bug, this one moving. 

At this point we lifted the mattress and discovered dozens, if not hundreds of bugs on the bed frame. Being late at night we took pictures and videos, booked the nearest reasonably priced hotel and got the hell out of there. 

The host is refusing the give us a refund saying that if we’d asked he had another property nearby he could have offered. He also said that if we canceled and he can rebook the place he’d consider a refund. Both those options sound ridiculous to me -
1.	Why would I trust any other place doesn’t have the same issues?
2.	I’ll get my money back if he can get someone else to pay to sleep in a bug infested bed? 

Airbnb tells me that bugs aren’t a covered reason for a refund because they’re not considered dangerous to humans which is also absurd. 

At this point I’ve told Airbnb that I refuse to cancel or move to another of the hosts properties. What methods are available to me to get a refund? I’ve attached some pictures but beware if you’re squeamish

Airbnb won’t give a refund and I’m not sure if this is common on the site and what should I do. This feels like a scam. 

Airbnb has suggested I cancel but I won’t get much back and can’t even talk to anyone else about it.

We’re renting it for two weeks and a couple days ago (a week into our stay) ladybugs started to pour in from an unknown source. They would send their cleaning lady to remove some of them and tried spraying to deter them but nothing has worked and it’s getting worse. All over the ceiling and everyday more come in.

Airbnb,We have exited the Golden Age of AirBnB,"All of these beloved tech ventures seem to follow the same arc.

They begin as a clumsy experimental adventure with early adopters hopping aboard with a fervent enthusiasm. They don't care about the hiccups or complications.  They're there for the wild new ride.

Then comes the Golden Age.  The kinks are mostly worked out, but the community is still small or medium-sized.  The rules are few, the costs are low, and the possibilities are many.  It's fun, sexy, and interesting.

Then comes the corporate taming.  After critical mass is achieved, it's time to make money.  Then comes the rules and the new mass of users who aren't interested in the original vision.  They're here to consume.  The prices surge as the platform seeks to become a primetime mainstream avenue.  The old vision is now a memory for those that still remain.

We've seen this with YouTube where people used to be able to post freely, engage, freely, and enjoy wild ad-free streaming. Now everybody is cancelled, users are afraid to make a documentary about the holocaust lest it be shadow banned or demonetized.  Many of the people who made the site great are banned.  There were one and now two ads before each video.  Now even 30 minute ads.  It's all got to be advertiser friendly.  Uber began cheap and fun.  Now it's expensive and stressed.  Facebook and Twitter- well you know.

I've used AirBnB for years now.  I've come to the realization this year that it's no longer the AirBnB that captivated me.  Gone are the $15 couch listings or the $25 rooms. Gone is the host-guest connection.  Gone is the freedom to use a space freely. Gone are accurate prices.  Instead, there are prices that have now surpassed hotels.  Pages of rules and housekeeping expectations.  Counters looking to hike up the prices based on how many people you're traveling with.  You try to scan the listing for prices, but they're useless because they wait until the payment page to tell you that the actual price is double after all the taxes, fees, ""cleaning fees"", and extra guest surcharges.  Oftentimes it's a very corporate vibe in these places.

AirBnB is a new place now.  What's good is that there are so many more options- many of them exotic, fascinating, and exciting.  But at the same time, a price has been paid.  I used to use AirBnB exclusively, but I find myself drifting back to hotels.  For many listings, the prices and restrictions are not worth it.

Edit: For those who were unsure,

Things I DID NOT say:  
\-AirBnB is going broke  
\-AirBnB is no longer growing  
\-Hosts are bad  
\-I hate the app  
\-I want all listings to be cheap  
\-Your listing is overpriced  
\-You're a bad host  
\-Every listing is corporate and impersonal   


Things I DID say:  
\-The company has changed. It's in a different phase.  
\-The pricing system is less transparent  
\-Many of the current aspects are corporatized

Airbnb,"Stalked, harassed and was a victim of attempted assualt at an AirBnb. AirBnb is not refunding the money.","Long story short: random person was staying at the Airbnb (instead of the host as advertised). This person stalked, harassed and would shout loudly even if i never talked to them (seemed manic / mentally unstable). I ran out of the property on the 3rd day because on the first two days i thought if i ignore this person, i would have an OK stay but on the 3rd day this person was shouting so loudly at me and wouldn't stop beating on my room's door even if i told them to go away. I was afraid of getting physically hurt.

I ran out of this property to save my life.

I raised a complaint with AirBnb to try and get my money back. AirBnb connected me with their trust and safety team. I submitted all evidence (text messages between me and host and the host agreeing that this incident took place). My support ambassador keeps changing every few days. And i get no real updates on what's happening behind the scenes or whether i will get a refund.


It's been 6 days and the trust and safety team keeps telling me 'we are working on it. We don't know how long it will take.' no refunds, no updates. 

What should I do? If i hire a lawyer, do you think i can win a case against AirBnb and also ask for damage fine for the mental distress?

How about if I raise a dispute via my credit card company. would that help expedite the issue?

It's hundreds of dollars because it was a month long stay. I feel sick for not receiving the refund and the fault being completely of AirBnb for not vetting the host and the host not vetting the random person who was staying there.",193,104,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/145slaf/stalked_harassed_and_was_a_victim_of_attempted/,2023-06-10 06:30:07,Airbnb

Airbnb,I’m a neighbour to a troublesome Airbnb. The guests have been harassing my family. I opened a neighbour support case but it has been closed [Aus],"I’m a neighbour to a troublesome Airbnb. The guests have been harassing my family. Not sure what Airbnb support are doing.

Two nights ago, we came home to music and drunken shenanigans blaring from the full time Airbnb behind us (that is right up at our boundary).

The guests could see my wife in our yard and our verandah and were hollering out to her. I phoned the hosting company who arrived to tell them to quieten down but did little to address my safety concerns. As a result, I opened a neighbour support case. I submitted video evidence of the drunken guest peering over our fence and waving to my wife.

At first I was hopeful, as I was told it was being investigated and I notice the listing no longer appeared online. However this morning I receive a message from Airbnb support saying that they are closing the case because the host is allowing the guests to remain. It also says to reopen the case when the guests leave. Except I do not know when that is. 
Why would they have removed the listing?

I’m quite concerned about how the safety aspect of my case is dismissed. I also have a young daughter at home and I am now very worried about what lies ahead for us. We deserve to use our property in peace.

Can anyone please tell me what’s happening?

I also drew their attention to the listing encouraging guests to socialise outside. The house sleeps 12:

“Discover a luxurious retreat perfect for families or groups at our four-bedroom, three-bathroom property. This beautiful property also has a spacious verandah and social spaces such as our tropical pool, large outdoor entertaining area and 2 lounge rooms.

Airbnb,AirBNB Host breaking ground rules and AirBNB isn't showing us any support -Listing Accuracy -Listing Cleanliness [USA],"This is a report in [USA]. My wife and I booked an AirBNB in Pensacola, FL. The AirBNB has a roach infestation, and we decided that we would not be staying there at all since I am allergic to roaches. They aren't willing to help us, and the host isn't willing to give us a refund. The listing also doesn't match the description. The listing shows that there is a paid washer and dryer on the premises, a closet, hangers, and a safe. The AirBNB actually has none of these. The space is too small and has a roach infestation. There are two policies which this listing goes against. The first policy is cleanliness. The listing doesn't disclose the possibility of roaches either. I will show the AirBNB host policy below. Why is it that they are allowing a host to keep our money even though we aren't staying at the property? He is violating two of the ground rules, and AirBNB won't do anything even though we have provided evidence. What actions should we take to get a full refund for a month? The total came out to over $1700 and the host doesn't care that we are having to deal with this. Yes he has a no refund policy, but why exactly is he able to get around the policy and not respect the policy?
What can we do?

Two of the ground rules that are being broken are listing accuracy and listing cleanliness.

Edit: The host changed the pricing to $1000 more so no one will book it. I assume he did this so we won't be able to get a refund from others booking. Originally he said that if we cancel, he will give us a refund when someone else books it. But now no one else will book it at all because who wants to stay in an old camper for $2600 when it was originally $1600? This is another issue as he is trying his best to keep us from getting $0.01 back. 

Edit 2: AirBNB finally refunded us in full on the 3rd attempt so this is no longer an issue. With the amount of evidence collected, it wouldn't make sense to have no refund after struggling through this.

Airbnb,How do I talk my boomer dad out of becoming an AirBnB host? [EU],"My parents and I live in a two story house with two separate apartments with their own entrances. Last year he got into debt to renovate the lower apartment (new floors,new kitchen, appliances, new bathroom, etc). He claims his pension, mom's pension and a small LTR apartment that we are already renting out, isn't enough to cover the cost of living and paying bills. He also has a friend who is an AirBnB host and who basically convinced him that being a host a great investment and that ""money is just flowing in"". The thing is, my boomer dad is just oblivious to the whole thing and thinks he needs just to open the doors, get the cash handed to him and that's basically it. He has no idea that running a STR is a 24/7 job, that you always have to be available, that cleaning/washing/drying/ironing is not as easy as it seems, that many unexpected things can happen and so on. On top of that he is already in his 70s, doesn't speak English at all and thinks he is capable of communicating with international guests and being a great host (or maybe he doesn't and expects me to do this instead of him). Also, seeing that state of AirBnB in my town, I think the market here is already way saturated and that many places don't even get bookings.How do I approach this situation?

Airbnb,"Just a girl, asking NYC AirBnbs to love her. Crushed. Give me new travel ideas [NC, USA]","My wife and I are retired (well I am, she’s about to). She loves the suburbs, and I always wanted to live in a walkable, diverse, LGBTQ friendly city. For the 30+ years of our working lives, I happily deferred to her preference because she’s totally worth it, and I’m just a more flexible person. But our retirement plan has always been to load up the dogs (we have dogs because that’s what lesbians do) and spend months at a time in the kinds of places I like (diverse, walkable, LGBTQ friendly). 

We got married in NYC pretty much the moment same-sex marriage became legal there. Many of our vacations have been there. So, I was like, first month, Brooklyn! I was willing to spend the money for a decent place. But I literally cannot find an AirBnB that will book us more than a couple of weeks in advance in Manhattan or Brooklyn (even though we’re happy to book the required month or more) because none of the hosts want to leave any gaps in their occupancy. I get it. People have made AirBnB-ing their whole profession now. And space in NYC is in short supply. But, dang. I was so ready for my retirement plan to start in NYC. 

Anyway, I give up on NYC. Now where? Has anybody had a great experience in my kind of place? Doesn’t have to be a big city. Just walkable and diverse. I want to wake up and walk my dog to the local coffee shop in a place where my Pride t-shirt and boyish haircut won’t make people stare.

EDIT: I never expected to get so many kind and encouraging suggestions. Thank you ALL so much! If you have any specific leads for me, feel free to DM me. (Am I allowed to say that on this sub??). Even though we travel we dogs, we’re super-conscientious guests and have always gotten reviews that say we leave places cleaner than we found them. I know there’s a lot of AirBnB negativity in some places, especially where property is hard to come by. But we’ve always had good experiences, partly because I message hosts before I book, make sure to mention my same-sex marriage, and I can usually get a sense of who they are. If somebody doesn’t want me there, I sure don’t want to give them my money.) Literally, all we want to do is see more of the country and experience the culture that exists there.

Airbnb,Got locked out of my airbnb but am I in the wrong? [USA] ,"So I originally got an airbnb with 2 other people. They ended up having to cancel our trip so it ended up being just me. I let the host know. 

So I head into the airbnb around 5pm. It's a shared building with multiple units. The bathroom and kitchen is shared. Behind some sliding doors is a little living room and a bedroom. Like a mini inlaw suite. 

I head out and I get back late, around 1:30am. First issue is all the streets around say residential permit parking only  and towing is enforced. The building is next to a lot with a driveway and a detached garage. I text the host saying I cannot find anywhere to park without getting towed. Please call me if I need to move my car. 

Then, I enter the code to get in like last time and it's locked. The light flashes green but there's a dead bolt probably that's keeping me from getting in. I call the host twice but nothing, as they must be sleeping. No where in the description does it say a time that the doors are locked, or that the doors are locked at all. 

Luckily I'm able to crash on a friend's couch 40 minutes away. Is it my fault for coming back so late to an airbnb on a shared living space? The airbnb itself is very well kept with many amenities and host seems to have great reviews but this for sure sucked.

Airbnb,Can an Airbnb host legally restrict the foods guests eat?,"
I stayed at a “vegan home” some time ago, and this question has been bothering me. The host only had a few rules, one being that no meat or eggs were allowed in the home. 

I can understand having a rule that prevents guests from cooking meat in a vegan kitchen. I can understand not being allowed to keep meat in a vegan refrigerator. I’d of course understand if the host had food allergies, but nothing specific like that was mentioned. The guests simply weren’t allowed to bring meat or eggs into the house at all. 
I had to double check all my luggage to make sure I didn’t have a Slim Jim or something packed away. I had to eat all of my meals outside of the home or in my car parked in the driveway. 

I’m always respectful of Airbnb hosts and their rules, but I felt discriminated against for my personal food preferences. 

I was not sharing the space with the host or anyone else. It was a whole house rental, and the host does not live there.

Airbnb,AirBNB made my baby homeless - host kicked us out in the middle of the night [Cayman Islands],"@airbnb Our host had a security issue - ground floor door not locking. When we told the host, he angrily kicked us out at midnight. We are now homeless 1000s of miles from home with a 13 month old baby. @airbnb is refusing to refund our money. Is this how you treat guests?

We now need to pay thousands of dollars in additional costs to find somewhere to stay in extremely last minute.

We were on the phone with airbnb support for over 3 hours last night until after 3:00 a.m. and they were no support. Just transferred from person to person and told escalation cannot be done without a supervisor who is not available and they will call us back within 24 hours.",3,104,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1al3ber/airbnb_made_my_baby_homeless_host_kicked_us_out/,2024-02-07 13:48:41,Airbnb

So when neither the host nor the guest have any evidence, the host's words always wins. So hosts can literally make up anything and Airbnb will believe them if you don't have any evidence.

Airbnb,Why you should use AirBnB,"I just wanted to make a post since I've seen so many people talk about how this sub has made them stop or want to stop using AirBnB. 

Sure, AirBnB might not be the value it used to be and there are negatives for sure, but I think it's unfairly bagged on here. 

I've stayed in about 12 AirBnB's in 8 different countries and I'm yet to be anything but satisfied with what I've recieved. Getting to explore a new city or country with an entire apartment for a base is so much better in my opinion that staying in a hotel and adds so much more to the experience. You're often in a more residential area which adds to the trip not to mention more privacy. 

When I leave I spend around 20 minutes max having a quick whip round and making sure I've left the place respectfully tidy. I've never had a host with unreasonable expectations nor any come back saying I haven't left it in the right condition. It's not unreasonable in my opinion to stick the dishwasher on, empty the bins and clear rubbish away which is all I've done. 

It depends what you want from the accommodation but I've been using AirBnB's for holidays for a few years and I'm yet to experience these awful situations. What you have to remember is people aren't going to make a post saying ""I recently stayed in an AirBnB and it was all fine"". There's a disproportionate non-representative amount of negative feedback on here.

My experience covers the UK and various parts of Europe. I understand that many users might be in the US where this might not be the case. I'm not saying AirBnB hasn't lost its way a little and doesn't have it down sides but for me I'd hate to go back to using hotels and I'm yet to have a negative experience.

Edit: seem to be getting down voted a lot for having a dissenting opinion. Reddit has such a childish way of going about things sometimes. I'm not invalidating anyone else's experiences and I'm not saying AirBnB is some faultless god send. I'm just sharing my positive experiences to balance out the overwhelmingly negative attitude towards it on this sub.",85,133,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/13uueyw/why_you_should_use_airbnb/,2023-05-29 13:06:07,Airbnb
Airbnb,"“I’m not refunding this. Bad impressions are not a reason to cancel.” Okay, let’s see what AirBnb has to say.","First time posting here but I felt like I should share my experience.

I’ve been a guest at dozens of different Airbnbs in numerous countries for about 10 years.  Most of the time, it’s awesome.  A couple of times I’ve been a little disappointed but nothing I couldn’t overlook, especially when I was younger and didn’t care as much about my personal comfort as much. 

I’ve also been a host and taken great pride in offering travellers a (very) clean, safe, affordable place to stay.

Fast-forward to this week. I’m working a new job out of town and needed a place to stay for 10 nights.  I found a nice accommodation in a town near to where I was working.  Two things appealed to me: (1) the price fit my budget and (2) the host specifically put in their description some notes about cleanliness - paraphrasing but along the lines of, “we ask our guests to keep the place clean and treat it as though it were their own home”.  

Cool. They must like their home to be neat and tidy. After all, they ask that of their guests.  They also stated they’ve been hosting for 9 years.  Awesome. 

On the day of my check-in the host messaged me to let me know they were out and that they left the back door open for me. Okay, no problem.  

I arrived around 8pm (after working a 14 hour shift) with a bag of groceries and walked in the back door.  Much to my surprise, I was met with a FILTHY house.

What does “filthy” mean in this context? Well, half eaten pizza on multiple plates on the counter tops. Numerous dirty pots and pans strewn about, condiment bottles and dirty dishes on almost every cooking surface and countertop. Stacks of garbage all over the kitchen countertops (pizza boxes, food containers, miscellaneous garbage like milk bags, cigarette cartons, used paper plates, etc).

It was disgusting. 

I decided to go upstairs because I was so tired I just thought I’d be in a better state to figure out what to do in my room.  Not surprisingly, the rest of the house was also cluttered and messy. Every room needed to be properly organized and cleaned. 

I went upstairs to my room (which thankfully was tidy) and sat on the bed for 2 minutes.  I messaged the host and asked if anyone else was there. I noted that it looked like the kitchen hadn’t been cleaned in a few days and that it was disappointing as I had been looking forward to making a meal after a long day. 

The host responded quickly and said that no one else was staying. They apologized for the mess and said, “Sorry, I figured I would get back first!”

This confused me since they had stated they wouldn’t be home upon my arrival and deliberately left the back door open for me.  If you were planning on being back earlier than me, none of that would be necessary. 

It was at that moment I decided to leave. I walked downstairs with my groceries, took photos of the mess, and got in my car.  I drove a short distance to a local park and messaged the host again. 

My next message to the host said: 

“I’m just going to find somewhere else to stay.  As a someone who has hosted myself, I would be embarrassed to let anyone see my house like that, let alone have someone pay.”

Their response was: “Sorry.”

I then followed up with:

“I am inclined to go through Airbnb so that it can be documented. But I believe you also have the option of offering a full refund, which I’d like.  I didn’t want to stay somewhere where that is the first impression.”

By that time they’d gotten home and tidied up a bit, and their last message to me was:

“Ok well if that's how you feel. I rectified the problem as soon as I got here. I'm not refunding this. Bad impressions are not reasons to cancel.”

My last message to them was:

“Actually, according to Airbnbs cancellation policies, it’s absolutely a reason to cancel.  So I’ll speak to them.”

I contacted Airbnb support, submitted the photos of the mess, and spoke with them briefly on the phone.  They were incredibly sympathetic and told me they’d contact the host and follow up with me afterwards.

I decided to book a last minute reservation at a local hotel since it was getting late and I was exhausted.  Within two hours, Airbnb contacted me to let me know that I would be getting a full refund. They also offered to pay for a portion of my hotel costs, since they were considerably more than the Airbnb I had booked.  The Airbnb staff did an amazing job. It was some of the best customer service I’ve ever received.  I’ve been in my hotel for a few days and still am amazed at how wonderfully they were able to handle the situation.

I’m inclined to leave a review but know that’ll only add fuel to the fire.  I hope the host learns to take their listing more seriously.  Nothing irks me more than an inaccurate listing, especially one that is so dirty and frankly, unhygienic.

If you ever find yourself in this situation document it, leave, and contact Airbnb.  I’m very happy I did.

Airbnb,Fire in AirBNB from plastic owner left stored in oven,"So I’m currently in midst the worst AirBbB situation I’ve ever dealt with. I checked into an apartment unit booking last night, and turned on the oven to pre-heat, planning to cook a frozen pizza I picked up earlier. After a few minutes I notice a strange smell and see thick white smoke pouring out of the oven. I open the oven to notice that a pot is already inside and what looks like a plastic tray below the pot, already nearly a pile of goo. I turn the oven off, make sure the fan is on high and rush to open all the windows in the unit. Soon enough the smoke detector is going off. I frantically go through cabinets to try to find a fire extinguisher, but soon realize there simply isn’t one. As the smoke is still thick and the fumes are unbearable, I open the door to the hallway. Within moments the smoke alarms on the floor are going off. I follow a number of residents downstairs, and pull up the app to call the host. It was difficult to understand her as well as hear, due to alarms now going off throughout the building. I try to clearly explain that a flammable object that was stored in the oven had set off the fire alarms, and the entire building was currently being evacuated. Per my phone’s history, it was only a 39 second call, and she never called me back afterwards to follow up. 

As all the residents and travelers on site gathered outside, I overheard a resident currently on the phone with the fire department. They arrived promptly, and I guided the firemen upstairs to my unit. The fire department finally leaves after about 20 minutes, helping to dissipate the smoke enough to stop the alarm sensor to continue to blare. Still in a state of shock, I found myself trying to clean up the area, as the interior of the oven and surrounding wall were covered in a spray of plastic chunks. Now, nearly an hour and a half after the ordeal started, I hear a knock on the door. It’s the owner, with this being my first contact with her since my phone call. She proceeds to look at the oven, and state that the plastic shouldn’t been there, and she checked earlier. She told me I didn’t need to clean, and she’d have someone to come tomorrow. She left after several minutes. No accountability. No apology. And no one ever came by to clean. 

I went out to get some much needed air, and against my better judgment decided to stay for the night. As the plastic fumes are still strong, I needed to keep all the windows open. Not great when it’s in the 30’s. In the morning I took steps to contact AirBnB support, and looker for alternate accommodations for my remaining two nights. They did reach out to the host, who was unwilling to provide any refund. I’ve since submitted a direct refund request to the host for the total of two nights (rather than 3, as although unpleasant I did end up staying.) She has since denied the request, and I escalated it to the AirBNB resolution center.

Airbnb,Expectations of an AirBnB vs. a hotel,"So I’ve been hosting around five years, only around 15-20 guests a year (which allows flexible check-in times) with max 5 days per stay, from a city center-apartment that’s cheaper than hotels but not motels. Lately I’ve been thinking about the shift in norms since I started in regards to the kinds of questions as well as the number I get asked.

“How do you get to xyz?”, “Can you research where I can find this very particular item?”, “Can you rent bikes for us?” etc. Now, I have a new Lonely Planet guide they can take with them and a 7-page document with my own recs. I’m happy to spend some time answering questions when they get here, but eight questions per day on a weekday is a bit much. I try to be shorten responses or explain that I’m unavailable at certain times but it’s hard to just ignore people altogether. 

My question is... am I just out of touch? I’ve never in my life been that demanding at a hotel. I honestly find it incredibly rude - I’m not a live-in tour guide - but I’ve read about hosts on here who’ll drive their guests to and from the train station or w/e.

The host has their identity verified by AirBnB (they have that badge) and has only one 5.0 review. But I feel anxious that i am not sure how my host that i would be staying with would look like.

I have politely reached out to the host to verify their profile photo but they replied to say that in their verification data all of their information is verified. Currently, my cancellation is non-refundable.

Airbnb,"Posting on behalf of my sister: we are both new to posting. Her dog ate grapes that were growing outside at their pet friendly Airbnb and became very sick and we are trying to find out what legal recourse she has. [Va, USA]","I am going to try to copy my sisters post she attempted to put up on here for her.
Hi! This is my first post so I apologize if I did this incorrectly. I rented an air bnb that is stated to be dog friendly.
The property has a beautiful fenced in yard that my dogs love running around in. We are in town to see family and we left the dogs at the rental for a few hours while we visited them. When we got back we saw one had vomited and had diarrhea. I immediately started cleaning, thinking he maybe had a bug or something. As I was cleaning up I noticed little grapes mixed in.
Long story short, they are toxic and it turns out there was a grape vine hanging over the fence and the grapes had fallen off and were hiding under the long grass and leaves. We ended up at the emergency vet for about $800 so far. We have to head home a day early to get him to our regular vet to retest his kidneys. We have a small window that he can go unmonitored since they started the preventative care here at least. The other option is to admit him here and be stuck out of town an extra 2 days, which we can't do. My dog won't be out of the woods for another 30 hours or so.
This is a nightmare and I just want my dog to be ok. At the very least, I need this listing to not harm anymore animals.
I'm hesitant to reach out to the owners and airbnb until I have all the information I can gather and google has given me nothing to go by. Thank you in advance to anyone that has any advice to offer.

Update:  just to add to this post so everyone can read it.  The dogs were left for a couple of hours inside the house with a nest camera they watch while not there.  The dogs otherwise go everywhere they can bring them with them.  The dogs are not unattended.  They are also kept contained in one room with a camera they don’t let them roam around the house if not there.  I understand everyone has their own opinions but they are good people and take good care of their dogs.  They are loved and happy ",0,132,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/17jx9t6/posting_on_behalf_of_my_sister_we_are_both_new_to/,2023-10-30 16:24:35,Airbnb
Airbnb,"Locked out of our house rental, airbnb told me couldn’t help due to apple email [USA]","Our home is under construction so we did a rental for a few months down the street. In the listing it doesn’t state that this home is actually a triplex, the day of arrival we get an email with all the details we never had before. Still not knowing this is a triplex we show up and discover it as a two plex. 
We couldn’t get the front door unlocked. Reach out to host who then informes us this front door has no code and we proceed in to find a shared entry. So in this shared entry it has our door and a guest door. The guest door is a regular door. No lock, you open it and it takes you downstairs to another door with a key code. 
Our unit is weird our curtains are on the outside in this shared entry, and every time the guest tenants come and go the breeze blows our curtains up. We have caught their eyes and they have caught our several times. The front of our unit is a full wall of plastic windows. The plastic is broke in many places. These windows you can see straight into the kitchen and living room.  We make our way in and everything about this listing is a lie. This place is a dump , says it sleeps 7, but it has one queen bed. And 3 twin beds in tiny rooms   So I’m not sure how 7 fit. 
On to my issue this shared entry has been a huge challenge, this triplex is on a main road and while it looks like it’s secured from the outside, fake locks. On the inside you actually can lock it however if you do the other tenants won’t be able to get in. 
So one day we come home and we are locked out. I email host and he within probably 40 minutes gets ahold of this guest unit and they unlock it. 
We’ve had other issues with this shared entry as well. The guest that are staying in the guest unit mop their floors every night, problem is. It’s an old mop at it’s gone rancid. I mean the smell was unbearable. After 2 days of us gagging every time we go through this weird entry, finally host replies ( we didn’t know why it smelled) and says oh the guest unit mops nightly. They will put mop out front to solve issue. 
So tonight we get back and it’s raining hard and it’s cold. The front shared entrance is locked again. This time we don’t hear back from host. We email and call.  We ended up getting his number because he called us one time due to him taking 2 days to respond about the smell. I threatened to move out in the email and he calls immediately. Luckily so we call his number. No answer. We text, I even face timed him. We are cold and wet, decided after an hour to get ahold of Airbnb. Problem is my email address didn’t match the reservation, even though as I’m calling them they are responding to me through email. 
I verified everything including phone number, last 4 of credit card, and birthday. But they still can’t help me because I can’t verify email. 
We are going through everyone’s email in our family. I was so confused what email could I have given them. Anyway eventually this worker I’m speaking to tells me she isn’t able to help and hangs up.  
So I call back and get a different guy. Through him I’m able to find on the app the email I used.  Well kinda anyway, it’s an apple hidden email. So I can only see the first letter the *** then the last part of the email. He tells me because I don’t know what’s under the stars.  While it matches without those *** he can’t help me either.  So here we are stuck outside in the rain. With one of our dogs. Our other dog just passed away hours before. Anyway our home is gutted so we can’t stay there. We only have keys to one car and all 5 of us including the dog are just kinda stuck. 
Eventually my husband sees an open window open on the 2nd level and realizes he can climb on the roof and get in. This is how we ended up gaining access.
This whole rental has been a nightmare and the listing is a complete lie. No one knows they are not renting a private house, the place is a dump. Only after arriving do you realize only one couple can share a bedroom. Our kitchen and living room is totally open to anyone really to see inside and honestly the broken plastic windows would be so easy for someone to come into our unit. The fully stocked kitchen is a laugh. Everything about this place is just yuck. But we felt trapped and our remodel had started and we couldn’t stay in our home. So we decided we would bring all this up after we left and our home was finished. This is an illegal triplex this is why this weird shared entrance is even a thing. The host has gone to great lengths to hide this from the city and I’m certain Airbnb isn’t aware either. 
The host got back to us a few hours later through a text. Telling me tomorrow he would change the lock so it can’t lock. I told him it would be safer to have the lock but give the shared entry code to both tenants. He told me he did that before but it was a nightmare with everyone not remembering 2 codes. I told him it’s not safe and how weird that our curtains are on the outside of our unit and anyone can look in. Also brought up the broken plastic windows. 
Anyone know how I can get help from Airbnb without knowing these hidden characters Apple did to hide my email address? Now I’m really concerned because without Airbnb helping me they won’t ever fix this issue and the safety concerns me.

Airbnb,"As a guest in about 25 AirBNB's in 12 countries this year, here is my advice and observations.","It is me and my spouse. Our stays are generally 5-6 days. All of our reviews as guest are 5 star.

1. Coffee. You all have it, unfortunately I will always need to buy more. The problem is there are so many types of single cup makers. Please be sure what ever form of coffee you are using is available at the nearest grocery to your unit. No one wants to play find the store with this random capsule. At one point, I literally had more types of coffee than I had pairs of underwear. If you use a single cup makers, please have a cheap French press or something to make a pour over. Coffee should be this hard.
2. You really can put more than 2 plates and 2 cups in the unit. Likewise, you may think you are saving money by skimping on wash cloths and dish rags, but I am using your washing machine almost daily.
3. Although my reservation is for 2, in a 4 person AirBNB, I intend on using all 4 pillows. Please provide the linens.
4. Some of you don't have cloths dryers, some have not so great a/c. Some have noisy traffic and neighbors. A simple fan makes all of these so much better.
5. While I can forgive not having enough soap or shampoo (notice that is 2 separate things). I have literally been told that it was my responsibility to buy toilet paper, as they provided half a roll. No one is traveling with toilet paper! You absolutely aren't getting a 5 star review if you aren't providing tp.
6. You lock the closet with extra supplies and linens and usually have the cleaning supplies and cleaning tools in there. Extra supplies aren't a must, but stop locking up the damn broom and dust pan!
7. Guest do not have the address and emergency numbers memorized and you likely don't have a landline to trace. Please print this and frame it. We had a medical emergency and I had no idea who to call or where to tell emergency services to go.
8. We are always finding our self needing a very small amount of things thay aren't easy to travel with. The following are a few examples of things we greatly appreciate: cotton swabs and balls, peroxide, stain remover, baking soda, sun screen, and umbrellas.
9. Plastic containers with a lid.  Ofen needed, rarely found. If you don't want to provide containers, a roll of foil or wrap is greatly appreciated. 
10. You probably have the most uncomfortable sitting furniture on the planet and have paid no attention to it.
11. I will take out the trash and put dirty towels where ever you ask, unless you charge a cleaning fee. However, do not ask me to strip the bed unless you provide very detailed instructions. For example, do you want me to remove the duvet cove when there was no top sheet? You gonna wash those pillow shams?

Airbnb,Help! Airbnb is scamming me,"So two days ago I was looking to block off multiple days for my stay. I was just browsing the app comparing different airbnbs. I searched using dates that were around the time i intended to stay which was 5 days but i searched for a 10 day window. 

I found one listing and I wanted to ask the host a question about the unit. The airbnb app is somewhat confusing because it doesnt tell you the total until you click reserve and I didnt see contact host option (i guess i missed it).  I clicked reserve to see the price of the cleaning fee. Below that I saw a message box to contact the host. I figured I could type my question here. I couldnt find that option anywhere so i wrote my message and clicked send. Only i mistakenly booked the listing. I then canceled right away receiving only 4% back. What the heck?!The total was $4,400.00! 

 Literally one minute later i called airbnb to report the mistake (8:28am was the mistake. My support ticket was 8:29am)

They said they would handle it and get my money back. A full day went by. The next day they said they cannot reach the host and it would take another day. I wondered why are they reaching the host? This was an error I made in the app. The day after they said the host can offer only 50% refund. Wait what?! I was expecting a full refund. Airbnb said because it was instant booking there was nothing that could be done about. So not only did I lose a couple thousand bucks those dates are now taken so I cant even use it the days I intended.

I feel like I got scammed. I just dont understand how a real company like airbnb doesnt have mechanisms in place to prevent this especially when I tried resolving it 1 minute later. Im really depressed about this. I really needed that money for this trip. Airbnb scammed me, pure and simple.

NEW UPDATE!
So the host responded. They responded to my message asking for a refund. Its weird they didnt even acknowledge the refund. Just for me to book new dates. NOW he says the real address is 5 miles from where its on the map. I took screenshots of the map and this fact. Im hoping airbnb rectifies this but they still have the record me saying i screwed up. 

Whats my next move? 5 miles is a lot

Airbnb,Cannot extend Airbnb with all my stuff in it which ends before I’m back in town [USA],"Okay, I'm kind of panicking because Im in a pretty bad situation. I booked an airbnb in Pennsylvania for an extended stay, and I've been living in it for almost a month now. My job sent me to Utah for a couple weeks and I don't get back until after my booking ends. I was going to extend my booking for another month or two but it isn't available anymore. I don't get back until October 30 and the booking ends October 22nd. I moved from a 3bd apartment into this single room airbnb so it's almost halfway filled with all my stuff and I'm all the way across the country. The host says he can't extend my stay. I really don't know what to do now. I thought the listings don't show to other people until after my stay is done so I thought I could just extend it at any time. I have no friends or family near me and no car. I used a company vehicle to move my stuff and I don't have one now. I really am stuck now.

Airbnb,Being charged $1400 for damage I didn't do. Airbnb says they'll charge my card in about 11 days [USA],"Really disappointed with this whole experience as it seems like Airbnb blindly sides with the host with these damage claims. I got charged an outrageous $1400 in damage which I didn't do and after multiple appeals Airbnb says that they've made their decision that the claim is valid and will charge my credit card soon. I don't care if my account gets banned at this point. I was originally planning to cancel my CC / report as stolen so I can't be charged but now I'm worried that they'll follow through with reporting this case to a debt collections agency.

Anyone have any recent experience with something like this? I really just want to be done with this whole situation. Do I have to worry about collections coming after me? Is there a better way to navigate this? I unfortunately did not take many videos and pictures so of course I don't have any proof to defend myself. Although I think any reasonable person would agree that the damage claim is outrageous so I hope it would play out well for me in court but I don't want to think about it getting that far.

EDIT: Wow this got a lot more attention than I expected. I'm not sure if anyone missed my reply with some details of the claims but I c+v here again so it's more visible.

Some of the **evidence pics** here which were used in the claim against me: [https://imgur.com/a/yxSq85P](https://imgur.com/a/yxSq85P)

To sum it up, one was ""damage"" to the bed frame, some sag in one of the corners which I didn't do. Claiming $600 for that.

Another was damage to the flooring, when I moved in I took the exercise puzzle mat flooring off the floors and put down my own carpets. The mats weren't glued down or anything and I was careful with putting it back when I left. They claimed $550 for this. The pictures taken were all of after my stay (except there one where my carpet is there, the host barged in without my permission to take that picture). I'm not sure how Airbnb support came to the conclusion that $550 worth of damage was done to the flooring just from those pics.

And another small thing with the mattress cover. This one I'm ok with since I did spill a little juice on it. I don't think the cover needs to be 100% replaced but hey if I'm only paying for that it's much better than the whole $1400.

If Airbnb would be willing to come to a compromise and take off the charges for the flooring and bed frame I would be happy to pay the rest off to settle this whole ordeal. But I'm not sure if that's possible at this point. I'm trying to contact them but it doesn't seem to be helping much.",20,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1e6p1bw/being_charged_1400_for_damage_i_didnt_do_airbnb/,2024-07-18 23:14:03,Airbnb
Airbnb,AirBnB says a family member “unintentionally” used my credit card [USA],"Sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. 

Yesterday I woke up to a fresh $322 charge on my card from AirBnB. I didn’t make any reservation. When I contacted AirBnB they opened a claim and within a day were able to respond saying they wouldn’t refund me the money because they believe a family member or close friend of mine “unintentionally used my credit card.” 

This is absolutely insane and did not happen. Does anyone know what lead them to this conclusion? Can I cancel this reservation in any way? Can I take any further action besides disputing the transaction with my bank? I can’t even afford my own vacation much less someone else’s.

Airbnb,Should I continue to fight for a refund after Airbnb has already sided with the Host? [Spain],"I booked an Airbnb for a 3-day stay in Spain many months ago and forgot to confirm what time I would be checking in with the host although we had been conversing through the app. Check-in was noted as 5p-7pm and I arrived at 7:24pm because of a late flight. The host refused to allow me to check in at any point during the 3-day stay. 

It was my bad that I forgot to confirm a check-in time. I had been travelling for many months and I simply forgot. What I'm frustrated about is that in her listing, she notes **""if the guests arrive with a delay of more than 60 minutes without previously notified, we will need to find another time to check in or the reservation will be cancelled.""** I arrived 24 minutes late, well under the 60-minute mark, but was offered no alternative check-in time within the entire 3-day stay as the host had left town. If I had known that she was planning on leaving the city the night that I arrived and she had to physically check me in, I would have cancelled the reservation knowing that travel delays happen.

I lost out on almost all of the $670 reservation fee and had to rebook my three-night stay that same night at another hotel. 

I contacted Airbnb support immediately but they sided with the host because I had not confirmed a check-in time. Is it worth opening a new case with Airbnb? It sucks to have lost the money but what I'm more upset about is the fact that the host **didn't follow her own listed rules** regarding checking in more than 60 minutes late.",20,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1daf9wz/should_i_continue_to_fight_for_a_refund_after/,2024-06-07 16:39:30,Airbnb

We were out late and upon coming in to the airbnb, locked the door using the latch lock that can only be unlocked from inside.

I woke at 3 am to the doorbell and my phone ringing, realizing it was our host who was very upset that she could not get into her home. I of course let her in and apologized for the mistake, but she was very clearly upset and did not accept my apology.

Airbnb,AirBnB Review Etiquette - Feedback Needed [Azores],"Hey everyone,

I recently stayed in the Azores for five days, and I had a pretty mixed experience with my Airbnb there, so I wanted to share and get some advice.

When I arrived, I noticed a bunch of drunk people loitering in the parking lot right across from my unit, along with some homeless individuals. Naturally, I raised my concerns with the host, but they assured me there was nothing to worry about. However, on the second day, after some sightseeing, I came back to find the same sketchy crowd across from my unit. Things took a turn for the worse when I looked out the window and saw someone smoking crack (I've got pictures and videos of this). I decided to open a case with Airbnb and ended up getting a full refund for the stay, then checked into a hotel for the rest of my trip.

The host later reached out and asked me to contact him on WhatsApp to share any pictures or videos so he could work with the local police. After my trip, I left the following review:

""I recently stayed at XYZ's Airbnb in the Azores. Mario was exceptionally friendly and responsive, always quick to address any questions or concerns. The space was spotless, and the pictures in the listing were accurate, reflecting a well-maintained and comfortable environment. Additionally, the nearby parking lot always had available spots, which was very convenient.

However, the location was slightly further from the city center than I would have preferred. More concerning was the presence of loitering drunks and drug users in the surrounding area, which made the location feel unsafe. This factor significantly impacted my overall experience. If it weren't for the sketchy surroundings, this would have been an excellent place to stay.

Despite the location issues, XYZ and his team were extremely helpful and responsive throughout my stay. If the area improves, this Airbnb could be a great choice for visitors to the Azores.""

Then, I received a very negative review from the host, stating I should never have left feedback because I was refunded for the stay. About a week later, the host messaged me on Airbnb again, asking me to take down my review because he refunded me and now people are questioning staying at his unit.

Should I take down my review? I don't want to impact someone's livelihood, but I also value being honest and transparent with other users. It's tough to find legitimate feedback since almost everything has like 4.5 or more stars.

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!",3,60,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1du2r38/airbnb_review_etiquette_feedback_needed_azores/,2024-07-03 01:49:53,Airbnb
Airbnb,Frustrated by Airbnb's lack of support for guests,"Mainly just looking to vent! 

Wrote a review for a host with both pros, cons and neutral aspects future guests should consider. 

Host left a completely false response to our review with lies claiming we had extra guests stay (it was literally just us 2!) and that we ""left the place a mess"" when I know for a fact it was left exactly how it was when we checked in. We are the cleanest and quietest people you could meet! This is on top of them falsely just contradicting what we had written. 

We barely spent time in the place because it was dirty and ate out as often as possible because the pots and pans were grimy af. 

Airbnb's response is to either msg the host to get the response removed (as if they're going to reply!?) or remove my review entirely so their response goes with it (and therefore the host is only left with positive reviews). Either way, the host wins! There is NO support for guests to have defaming falsities removed, or to even report the host. Airbnb won't even contact the host about it. 

Surely they can override and remove responses like this. I hate that it's supporting liars and pure AHs and not offering any sort of constructive help to guests who are paying hundreds of dollars to stay in these ridiculous places! First time questioning whether to no longer Airbnb.

If you can't handle constructive criticism and are petty, DON'T be a host!

Edit: Edit to say, thank you to everyone who has commented and shared their insight (except that one guy who we all think needs therapy...yikes). It has been really helpful to see that this is a more common thing than it should be and that most of you think I should keep my review up so that their retaliation is there for all to see.

Airbnb,"Host lying of breaking rules and canceling reservation without refund. Airbnb support fully on her side. [TX, US]","This is a follow up to this post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1gfp38l/host_set_absurd_and_unreasonable_rules_are_they/

After couple of days of 0 interaction with host or Airbnb support, host contacted Airbnb support and told them:

1) Guest broke the rule of ""leaving windows open"". Picture of open window was provided as a proof. What was left aside was that he was inside, that could be easily proven. Support doesn't care - made up some excuse about not letting bugs in. There are bug nets on windows.

2) Guest was ""calling her names"" - he did not interact with her at all in any way.

3) There were additional guests - picture of someone at the door was provided as a proof (from doorbell). I was there to help get is bag in for 10 minutes - once, when he was checking in.

Airbnb support is cancelling a 30 day reservation without refund solely based on a picture of open window and more than one person standing at a doorstep. 

Would appreciate any actionable advice. He just moved from another continent, he is a refugee from Ukraine and he is 20 years old with limited resources, extremely stressed about this situation. Host is acting absolutely unreasonable and what she is doing seems fraudulent to me.

Airbnb,"Airbnb claimed I overstayed by a week, suspended my account and stole my money","We had so many issues with our last vacation in Florida. Two houses canceled on us and then I booked a house literally at the airport flying out. The house Was leaking in one bedroom and toilet clogged. They couldn’t fix it so they refunded part of my money and we agreed to stay the rest of the trip and pay $500. The other friends had to get a hotel.
During check out I messaged host telling them I left and we continued talking for the rest of the week. I wanted to make sure Airbnb gave them the $500. Friday he said he had not received it but will wait. Saturday I wake up to a missed call from airbnb at 8am. Monday I check my account and money has been taken by airbnb. I try to log in and my account is permanently closed. I check emails and i found an email Sunday saying host claimed I never checked out until Saturday. So they took money for the extra days and closed my account after “investigation”. I send them flight details for all our friends and car rental receipts showing return date. They said I can appeal through the website but I’m locked out. The communication with host was through the App so they can see I clearly checked out. Host also has cameras they refused to say if they provided footage. I have cameras in my house showing I was back home plus checked bag receipts and gas in my city which is far from FL. I have heard nothing yet..,
What next?

Edit: I have the host phone number cos he wanted me to update him on the contractor fixing the ceiling. I have not reached out to ask why he lied because I have a feeling it’s airbnb lying and not him. Our house got canceled prior cos the lady called me during a 12 hr flight and couldn’t reach me. She said cos I didn’t communicate with her she felt “unsafe” with me. I’ve had a verified account for 9 years with multiple positive reviews. When airbnb wouldn’t help find another place I called them out in Twitter with another friend. I think it was a retaliation for that cos my friends account was also suspended cos they said she’s closely connected to me. They got her details when I turned in the flight details.

Airbnb,AirBNB Scam? Potential Class Action Lawsuit? [USA],"I am posting in regards to an issue that I was previously unaware of, but after reading a multitude of posts, can see that it is fairly common (and certainly illegal).

I received an Airbnb gift card last Christmas, and was having issues accessing my account because it was linked to an old email. My partner loaded the gift card into his account, and we proceeded to book and pay for an upcoming stay.

Yesterday, they requested his ID (as he had not used his account before), and after running a background check- decided to ban his account over a 15 year-old arrest that adjudication was withheld on.

While he appeals, I go online and see HUNDREDS of others in similar situations, who have also lost their gift card funds due to this issue. Today, his appeal was denied, and just like so many others have stated, the gift card was “refunded” to his now banned account.

Most of the replies on these posts seem to get into the users background and appeal, but I am not interested in that. They have a right to ban whoever they want, I am not arguing that at all, nor do I care. They do not have a right to take gift card funds indefinitely and “refund” them to an account that they deactivated with no way to access, refund, or transfer the money. That is a form of theft.

I have read the TOS, and this specific issue is not addressed. I cannot imagine how many millions of dollars Airbnb has pocketed through this loophole (I have found reports going back to 2020), and am aware that if hundreds have posted about this online, that it is only a tiny fraction of the actual amount of users that have experienced this. I simply want my money back, and to compile the experiences of others who have gone through the same situation. The fact that Airbnb has done nothing to address this issue in the past 5 years (probably more), leads me to believe that they are aware and do not intend to remedy the situation, nor have I seen a single report where a user got their gift card funds back in any form.

TL/DR: $500 gift card added to account, account was banned for background check, funds are “refunded” to banned account (now inaccessible). Realized that hundreds of other users have had the same experience, and Airbnb has seemingly done nothing about the situation.",18,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1h48ovv/airbnb_scam_potential_class_action_lawsuit_usa/,2024-12-01 17:40:49,Airbnb
Airbnb,"Airbnb refunded me for inaccessible booking, host charging me £800 for a wet balcony table plus cleaning fee, what do I do!? [UK]","I posted on here a few weeks ago (thanks for advice!) as I moved to an Airbnb after a breakup, making the host aware I had accessibility/mobility issues who advised me she had some personal items in the room, but actually the room was covered in boxes and personal items just thrown all over the floor. I couldn't use the space because I kept falling over and hurting myself lifting boxes to move around constantly and there was no food storage and limited hot water/no towels or breakfast as advised. After 3 days I contacted the host to depart and went via Airbnb support with videos/photos.  They refunded me the remaining nights (it was a two month booking) including cleaning fee and discounted the impacted nights I stayed. Regardless, on checkout, I washed up all the stuff in kitchen id used, made the bed, and sweeped parts of the floor I could access prior to departure.

Today, I've had a request from the host for damages, nearly 2 weeks post check out to replace a table on their balcony, costing £800, plus cleaning fees on top. They have suggested the rain cover was removed and the table got water damaged and they also want the cleaning fee returned. We've just had a big storm here in the UK this weekend that is literally blowing away furniture. The water cover is still on in the photos I sent Airbnb, but there is NO WAY the table cost £800 regardless - which I couldnt access or use anyway, as the host also used the balcony to store personal items and boxes. 

What's the process for rejecting this??

Airbnb,"Termites caused me to reach out to Airbnb Support and my host is now upset with me [FL, USA]","Hello, I’m in a long term Airbnb this summer for an internship and I’ve been in this Airbnb for almost 2 months now and have one more to go. 

I went on a trip for a week for work and when I got back I noticed some paint had chipped away on the door frame. When I started looking into it, I saw termite droppings and I got a little nervous. I then started checking the bathroom a bit more and I noticed a little hole in the wall and when I started looking at it a bug poked its head out! 

I messaged my host but she is in Spain so I knew I wouldn’t hear back from her until the morning. From hearing about how awful support can be on here if you wait to tell them about problems I decided to reach out to Airbnb support just in case it was going to be a big problem and I would have to get moved out. My grandparents house got completely infested when I was a kid and they were out of their house for weeks, so I wanted to prepare for the worst as I didn’t want to end up homeless.

This morning my host messaged me back and she asked if I had reached out to Airbnb. I told her I had as I know you can only report problems very soon after you find them and I wanted to protect myself in case it was bad enough I would need to leave. She got pretty upset with me and told me that she had gotten an email saying her listing was at risk of suspension and that I shouldn’t have reached out to Airbnb and just had let her deal with it. I told her I wanted to protect myself in order to ensure Airbnb could cover me and make sure I’ll have somewhere to stay. She said she would never let me go homeless and that she cares about me as a guess. I told her I’m sure she would do what she could to help me but Airbnb is a contract vs just trusting her on her word. 

Today the exterminator came through and said it shouldn’t be a big problem and that the spot treatment should kill them and I will be okay to the stay there. Airbnb told me I do have the option to leave if I’d like but the place I’m staying in is nice and it’s very close to my job. 

I just wanted to know if I was an asshole for immediately reaching out to support, I just didn’t want to end up homeless and I do feel bad because she’s a nice host but I feel like Airbnb should know that they were having a termite problem and even though it isn’t her fault it is something she has to deal with in her home.",96,104,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1535a4h/termites_caused_me_to_reach_out_to_airbnb_support/,2023-07-18 17:51:10,Airbnb

Airbnb,Faux “pet friendly” Airbnb’s- a rant.,"This may be a heated debate fyi: 

Currently on a road trip with hubs and pups and learned that hotels are not the best option for us. Before booking a bnb, I always reach out to the potential host and ask if they are pet friendly, even though these hosts have advertised they are pet friendly. 
 
A handful throughout this trip have responded with:

“We are pet friendly but ask that your pets not get on the furniture”

I’m sorry, if this is the case, you are NOT pet friendly. 

We have our own pet blanket that we use on beds and couches but the fact that someone would advertise as pet friendly but aren’t equipped for pets is wild to me.

Edit for clarification: this has nothing to do with entitlement. It has nothing to do with “wanting our pets on furniture”. The point is, if you have restrictions on pets, you aren’t pet “friendly” and shouldn’t allow pets. You are pet tolerant and want the money. I die on this hill.

It must be frustrating to encounter such obstacles and not receive the support you need. To better assist you, could you please confirm if the error message regarding your card being declined appears directly on the Booking.com website or app? 

I am confused by your question. One must go  to the App - booking.com to make a reservation. A reservation requires a credit card. The error message is “Please use another form of payment”.

Booking,Poor booking.com support - they can't do anything,"I have been using [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) for many years without any issues, but when a real problem arose, their processes proved impossible to resolve.  
  
I booked a hostel in Athens, and since my flight arrived at night, I mentioned this twice in my communication with the hostel. However, they only replied with generic, templated messages. Since the property description stated they had a ""24-hour front desk,"" I didn't anticipate any problems. Unfortunately, when I arrived, no one answered the door, and no one picked up the phone.  
  
I immediately contacted Booking.com support. The support manager also tried to reach the property but couldn't. We agreed that I would check into another hotel to avoid spending the night on the street, and Booking.com assured me they would compensate me for the price difference upon reviewing my invoice and the situation.  
  
What followed was three months of back-and-forth emails and phone calls with Booking.com support. They said they needed confirmation from the property that I hadn't stayed there, but the property ignored their emails. During this time, I came across similar reviews: other travelers had also arrived at night, found no one to let them in, and had to find alternative accommodations. It seems the recipe for some properties is simple: provide false information, take the money, ignore complaints, and vanish — while Booking.com does nothing.  
  
Eventually, I noticed the property was no longer listed on Booking.com. I contacted support again, only to hear the same apology: ""We can do very little after the booking date; we are very sorry."" But wasn't I promised a resolution by your manager?  
  
At this point, I've lost faith in Booking.com's ability to address such issues. That's why I'm making my story public.",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Booking/comments/1h5kdo8/poor_bookingcom_support_they_cant_do_anything/,2024-12-03 10:22:38,Booking.com

The reservation with this problem was from booking.com , after multiple discussions on the phone with different departments, evidence sent video bills , booking.com said they can not do nothing about it and could not compensate me at least 1000 euros for the damages realised to the property. On the other hand Airbnb compensate us the cleaning products and everything and the reservations was not on Airbnb.

I can not believe what desinterest booking.com have in this situations and I need some advice what can I do , they told me they act as a third party in a process of booking and they are not responsible.

I am afraid from now that I can have guests from booking.com which can damage the entire place and booking.com can not do nothing about that.

Booking,terrible experience on booking.com,"Let me tell you my horrible experience which was possible thanks to booking com.

So I've booked an accommodation to spend my honeymoon in Stockholm with my wife. It seemed nice and had a LOT of positive reviews and also had a nice feature of online self check-in which was important to us as our flight arrived at about 11 pm.



3 days before check-in I wanted to get an idea of how their online check-in process works and there was no info except message from the property stating that ""by now you should receive all the info & instructions you need to check in yourself by SMS and email"". I'm not even sure if the accommodation had my phone number or email at that time. I've tried to reach to them but they've sent me few template answers stating similar things. After a while they requested my phone number and email and said that they sent me a link but unfortunately it never happened. So I tried to reach them both by email and booking\_com private messages but I got nothing.



Then I had many phone calls with booking\_com support during 3 days before check in and they said that they tried to make phone calls to the property to 3 phone numbers they know but got 0 response and the only available option for me is to come to the place after check in time and if there'll be nobody to check me in, they'll start a relocation process ASAP to a property of better or same class.



So we've just let it happen and when we arrived to Stockholm there were obviously nobody at the property that late to help us. I gave booking\_com support a call (bunch of them actually during 4 hours from 2 to 6 am :() and all I got is few links to book a properties which were already unavailable to book or were available only starting from the next day and were actually worse than what we've booked and also they offered me to book something on our own and they cover the difference to a 25 euro MAX which is again nothing knowing prices in Sweden.



P.S. we finally had to spend 1 night outside with all of our belongings (a nice bonding experience :)) and got 0 help from [booking.com](http://booking.com) support.

Booking,How to import a shared reservation at booking.com?,"Hi,

A friend of mine shared the reservation #s and PINs with me, I have imported all of them via web booking.com to my account (like eight of them).

To my despair, in ""Bookings & Trips"" section no imported reservations are shown. I checked the android app and it is the same - no active reservations are listed.

P.S. I have re-added all the reservation via the android app. Now they show in ""Active trips"" on mobile, yet these do not show in the web booking.com.

*Is there a special voodoo procedure to import reservations via web and get them shown also on mobile?* I really hate to copy & paste & edit from whatsapp to Bookings app on mobile.",1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Booking/comments/1dmjqrs/how_to_import_a_shared_reservation_at_bookingcom/,2024-06-23 11:06:17,Booking.com
Booking,Avoid Booking.com flights,"With the massive advertising campaign associated with the European Football championships I think it is important to raise awareness about the business practices of Booking.com's flights department. 

The TLDR; - Do ***NOT*** ***book flights*** via [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), ***use a travel agent***!

Here's a summary of my experience:

* Booked an international flight via [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) with the option Flexi ticket that allows change of dates with no additional charge in May 2024. I needed to be able to postpones my flight by about a year due to a project I am supposed to work in depending on environmental conditions.
* Of course, things happened and I had to change the flights about 3 weeks before planned departure, so I visited [booking.com](http://booking.com) website. Could not get my flight details via the website. This only worked via the link that came with the booking confirmation email.
* Entered a loop when trying to reach out to customer service to initiate the booking change by clicking on ""Go to help centre"" which only showed me previous hotel bookings as supported bookings.
* After following many links which I unfortunately did not record at the time I somehow ended up on a page that offered a customer chat! (Despite the fact that on Reddit many people claim it does not exist. It does, but it is well hidden).
* Customer chat informed me that I can only change my flights up to one year from the date of the booking change (i.e. the date I am initialising the booking change). My original booking had the first flight on 5 July 2024, so any changed dates - including the return flight HAD to be before 5 July 2025. 
* Okay, I can work with that. However, To change my last flight, i.e. my return flight to occur on 4 July 2025, I had to wait with my reservation change until 24 hours before my planned departure, that is 4 July 2024. Awfully close to the cut-off time after which I no longer can change my booking.
* Waited until 48 hours before said cut-off period. Could not find the [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) customer chat, but luckily during my previous chat session I had asked them about how to get in touch and they referred my to gotogate.com.
* Went to [gotogate.com](http://gotogate.com) and tried to log in with my email and... ""order number""? Could not find an order number in any of the communication I had with booking.com. I only had a customer reference number and pin code, as well as the airline booking code.
* Luckily, I had booked my flights with my google mail account so that I could choose the ""Log in with Google"" option on gotogate.com. Did that and saw my booking details! Hooray! It even displayed the order number I had never seen before. 
* Clicked on the flight... only to be asked again to log in again with my email and order number. I had scribbled down said order number just in case. So tried to log in with it only to be told by the website that this booking did not exist.
* So... clicked on Support on the [gotogate.com](http://gotogate.com) website, tried to provide them with the order number (did not work of course) and eventually clicked on ""I don't have an order number"". That then displayed a phone number in NZ. I was in Switzerland. 
* Alright, called the NZ number and was greeted by an lady with a heavy Indian accent. Told her my name and order number and she managed to find my flight details. After sitting in a ""Please hold"" loop while the lady tried to change my bookings, I was advised that I should call back in another 2 to 3 hours but ""make sure to call before the 24 hours time limit before the original departure""! Great. Not very comforting, though, considering that I have less than 10 hours left to change the flights.
* After the call, I decided to try my luck finding the chat again. Because that way, I at least have a record of my comms with booking.com. To my surprise, I was able to find the support chat this time, by selecting the ""I can't find my booking"" in my Booking.com profile, entering the confirmation number and PIN that came with the original flight booking email, clicking on the filght that is then displayed and selecting ""I need help with... other"". There's that chat!
* Chat is a slow back and forth and this time I am being told that I can only change my flights within a one-year period starting *from the day I made the booking* - which is months before my planned departure effectively cutting the validity of my ticking down to about 8 months instead of one year. I told ""Jayprakash"" that I have a record from a previous chat session that advised me to wait until today to change my booking. Then he asked me to wait 5 minutes. I did. He asked me to wait another 5 minutes. I did. In the end I was told that the customer support would contact me.
* Now the clock is ticking, and my anxiety level is increasing. And with it comes the realization that all this could have been avoided - if I had gone to a travel agent in my home town. 

So just to reiterate - my advice is to avoid using [booking.com](http://booking.com) to book flights.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Booking/comments/1dv19r0/avoid_bookingcom_flights/,2024-07-04 07:42:42,Booking.com
Booking,Booking.com issue,"Hello. I have used Booking.com for a long time but never encountered such weird problem.
I have booked a hotel on Booking.com with the payment being handled by the property. It also says that I will be charged 50% of the price after reservation.

We successfully checked in and the host didn't ask for money or anything.

Bookings has a monopoly on third-pary lodging transactions.  They own Expedia, Agoda. etc.  With the billions of revenus they receive, theonly problem they can resolved is a booked reservation. It was astounding that  a company that makes in billions will not let you  talk to someone.  The  assumption that all questions can be answered by providing reservation number and pin. Their solution was for me to open up another account with different email and they would merge the accounts later.  Ridiculous as there is no app or mechanism to solve this either.

Booking,Deceptive listing of Aiden Mansion rental unit in London ON through booking.com,"3 adults reserved 3 rooms at the Aiden Mansion (367 Ridgeview Court London, ON) on April 10-11, 2024 through booking.com. It was not a good experience for multiple reasons:
1. 2 hours prior to arrival we were emailed that our third room is no longer available despite  reservation AND payment. No refund permitted as there were still 3 adults to accomodate but no bed for the third person who paid for one. 
2. Upon arrival at 6pm (check in starts at 3pm) we were told to wait outside for 2 minutes. It took 20 minutes for the host to let us in for unknown reasons while we waited outside in the rain. 
3. It was not disclosed that the accommodations were shared.There is a family that resides in the house with children and multiple people coming and going. You have to walk into the hosts living room to access/exit the basement. And the second bedroom was located on the second floor such that one has to come up from the basement, through the hosts house and to their private upstairs to gain access to the bedroom (which is amongst the hosts' bedrooms). 
4. Essentials as described and depicted were not available. We had to bother the host in her living room on multiple occassions for items such as linens/blankets/pillows for the third person (despite no bed or couch to sleep on), 
no kettle/coffee maker in the kitchen, no cups/spoons/dishes, no hand towel in kitchen or bathroom, no garbage bag or papertowels, no tv hookups (no ethernet cables or anything so the old tv was useless), no hot tub/jacuzzi... the place was barren. 
5. There was a lack of cleanliness (ie. stains on floor, stains on the towels tthat we did finally receive) with old decrepit furniture (ie. missing springs in a mattress that sucks you into a gap). There were random items stored in a dishoveled manner throughout the basement (ie. suitcases, vaccuums, boxes, old empty freezers, etc).
6. The neighbourhood appeared nice but so many people going in/out of the house and neighbouring houses, standing around cars exchanging questionable items, police cruiser on the street...
Overall we felt unsafe, awkward, unwelcome and taken advantage of. Thus, we decided to abort our trip and return home very dissatisfied and out by $300. I do not recommend this booking ever and furthermore, believe it should be removed as it is fraudulent and deceptive.

I know from AirBnB that this is how these sites block your account without actually saying your blocked.

I had many bad experience recently were the hotels cancel my reservation after I check in and stay at their hotel just to look like that I didn't stay in their hotel to avoid getting bad review, this is happening a lot lately and it seems booking.com is standing by these hotels side by confirming their cancellation after deducting my amount even that booking.com asked me if I stayed and I confirmed that I stayed and paid the amount completely. Also booking.com customer service is the worst they don't let you reach them easily through their app they just keep redirect you to their frequently asked question. Add to that their fake discounts and misleading options for single beds and double beds , when you choose something ngke beds you choose it for a purpose and when you confirm your reservation the hotel will decline your single beds request without refund and you will get stuck with staying with this hotel, and when you get back to booking.com customer service after millions of try and putting you on hold and disconnect your line the agent will tell you we can't do anything to you because the hotel deducted the amount.",9,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Booking/comments/wu9ch3/bookingcom_review/,2022-08-21 20:26:05,Booking.com
Booking,issue with being charged fully on discounted listing at booking.com," I have been with my wife on a vacation in Spain while there we have booked whole apartment vis [booking.com](https://booking.com/) which had some discount on it. It was on last minute so discount was to be expected it was 106€ instead of 153€ which is quite a lot considering. Everything went as usual, discount was as ""will be paid to the renter by [booking.com](https://booking.com/)"", great move on book it. Discount is listed going reserve, select payment method still showing 106€, ok. Business [booking.com](https://booking.com/) is trusted on, card is directly charged without confirmation ... and it is charging 153€ (I know its few euros, but I have when such big company is bullying customers, denning them their rights).

Then two weeks on chat with support they are asking me for evidence that does not exist and cannot be obtained and no sane person is taking screenshot at every step. (I have screenshot from my wife phone since we were both looking for places to stay and it kept cached in hers while disappeared on mine (since it was single property provider only 1 whole apartment)

Now they are discouraging me that I have no proofs other that given screenshot asking for documents that you are not able to obtain before the reservation, and afterwards is too late, they just sent you all documents with full price and no discount.

Same as described here, its been a year and the issue is still there:

Booking,Dishonest Booking.com price match claim,"Hi, there, booking community on Reddit. I want to share my experience with booking.com regarding their price match claim. Below you will find my last reply to their customer service and a screenshot with my correspondence with them before that reply. I write this in case someone else has had similar issues and maybe some of you can even offer advice as to what can one do better - I can't say that I handled the situation all that well, given the results. So here it is:

&#x200B;

>Hello. I've postponed my reply until now so that my emotions have time to cool down and because I didn't want to spend my vacation arguing about this any further. But I will leave one last reply, summarizing the events, my conversation with the booking.com's customer service and my position on this. The whole conversation thread will be then posted publicly so that people can decide for themselves if they will believe booking.com's price match claims or trust this company with their accommodation bookings. As for me - I will no longer use booking.com's services, even though I've been a long time customer. The true face of a company is revealed not when everything works, but in the ways the company resolves the problems that emerge. The way booking.com handled my issue eroded my trust in them and led me to believe that their services add no value to the booking process - I'm better off booking directly with the host through their site, or with one of their competitors.  
>  
>You can view the whole conversation, so I will try to be brief in my summary:  
>  
>We booked our hotel about a month before our stay. About a week before our vacation, while researching further for possible activities, we saw that the accommodation is around 40% cheaper on the host's own website. We contacted the property and they told us that they've reduced their prices and we should book directly through their site if we want the best price. We were a bit annoyed and felt as if we overpaid, but understood their position and didn't argue any further. Days after that and days before our vacation, my wife saw the price match claim on booking.com's website and we rushed to contact them, excited about the possibility to get around 500 euro back - the price difference of what we've paid and what the property was charging for the same accommodation, same dates on their website. The first response from the booking's customer support was that the accommodation type, listed on the host's own website was not the same as the one on booking.com. I've replied that this is not true, because the property had only one type of accommodation and besides the made-up name that booking.com has for this type of property, everything else about the listing on booking and the host's own website was exactly the same. I sent screenshots, as requested. After a couple of days of inactivity (deliberate stonewalling) from booking.com's side and my request to get an answer, another representative from booking.com wrote that I've not provided a valid link to the other offer and because it is now after the check-in dates, they can no longer verify the price difference. This was a blatant lie and its brazenness infuriated me - I've given the booking.com customer support numerous screenshots, links and their own representative has already checked the offer after I wrote them the first time and when they told me that the accommodation type is not explicitly stated. At this point I already knew that booking.com are not going to respect their own price match claim and decided to not argue further with them, as I was on my vacation, celebrating my anniversary with my wife. I want to point out that when we paid for our accommodation, we were actually satisfied with the price and had no intentions to try and reduce it. What made me unhappy was that booking.com made a claim that they didn't honour and what made me furious was their blatant lies and stonewalling. This eroded any trust that I had in them in the first place.  
>  
>In addition, I will append booking.com's price claim policy and argue why we qualify:

>Link to the full claim and policy: [https://www.booking.com/general.html?;tmpl=doc/rate\_guarantee](https://www.booking.com/general.html?;tmpl=doc/rate_guarantee)

>Full text with added arguments:

>We Price Match  
>  
>You can claim a refund for the difference if you happen to find your reservation cheaper on another website.  
>  
>Just remember to contact us after booking with us and at least 24 hours before your check-in date. You'll need to provide us with the link to the other offer and it must be online and available when we check.  
>  
>My argument: we contacted them after booking and more than 24 hours before our check-in. The offer was available when the first customer service employee checked it the next day. We provided links to the accommodation description and the booking, supplemented with screenshots.  
>  
>We Price Match checklist  
>  
>The other offer must be for the same property and accommodation type.  
>  
>My argument: it is. This rule is in place so that someone doesn't book deluxe but compare it to regular. The property has only one type of room.  
>  
>The other offer must be for the same check-in and check-out dates.  
>  
>My argument: it was. You can see from the screenshots.  
>  
>The other offer must have the same cancellation policy and conditions.  
>  
>My argument: it is, cancellation is not possible in both cases.  
>  
>When can't you make a claim?  
>  
>If the other offer is on a website that doesn’t reveal the property or accommodation type you’ll be staying in until after booking.  
>  
>My argument: it is not - there is one type of accommodation.  
>  
>If the other offer is part of a loyalty or rewards programme. We define this type of other offer as any situation where a customer gets a reduced price from a property or other website as a reward for repeat business, logging in, entering a coupon code, referring other customers, or performing any other action which then changes the initially shown price.  
>  
>My argument: it is not - the price is not shown as reduced, you don't have to enter anything, the price is just cheaper for everyone who wants to book for these dates.  
>  
>If your booking or the offer you're comparing with is labelled as Partner offer (i.e. is facilitated by a Booking.com partner company).  
>  
>My argument: it is not.  
>  
>You are free to make up your own mind about this. As I said, I will no longer use booking.com for my future accommodations, as I find them dishonest and untrustworthy. The risk of having a problem with my accommodation and not getting the appropriate response from booking.com's customer service is far too great to ignore.

Booking,My personal feedback about booking.com,"I used [booking.com](https://booking.com) in Auguest 2012 and October 2019. At that time everything was fine. But last March, one night (at 10:39 pm), I received a curious email about a reservation in Croatia I had not booked.  


I quickly logged in, cancelled the reservation, changed my password, and deleted as much personal information as possible.   


The next day, I contacted customer support to report the problem and ask them for the log to (1) report the attempted fraud to the local autorities, and (2) find out what personal informations the hacker get access to.  


Since then, I get... NOTHING ! I have contacted them several times, and two months later, I still haven't heard back, even though each time they told me I should be contacted within 48 hours.  


Therefore, dear Redditors, if you are considering using [booking.com](https://booking.com) for your next travels, I strongly recommend you to reconsider your choice due to the lack of security.

The host has always been rude with me and refused to give more information. I stupidly sent a security deposit via bank transfer as stated on the booking advert but now i realize my mistake. There is a lot of red flags on the advert. The pictures are random, the phone number is not working and when i posted that on a Facebook group for people in Alanya, Someone confirmed it's a scam.  
Booking support is useless, they keep repeating me the same script, refuse to admit it's a scam after i sent then all the evidence. I am travelling with my baby and old parents and i am scared to loose this money.  
I got them to investigate the property but i have no feedback, no understanding of what's going on it's very frustrating and i am angry at myself for trusting booking.

Booking,"Reservation cancelled after double payment, no refund.","I booked a few days at a hotel through Booking.com for my family's holiday next month and a few minutes after completing the procedure, the payment was taken from my debit card.  

Two days later, a second payment for the same amount was attempted but failed because I did not have the funds in my account (I only transfer cash when I know I need to pay something). Soon after, I got a notification from Booking telling me the payment failed and that I need to sort out my payment details or the booking will be cancelled.  

I immediately got in touch with the property through Booking's message system to let them know of the double payment, I sent them screenshots of my statement showing the successful payment that was deducted from my account and the second failed payment. I got no response for 4 days, and the reservation was automatically cancelled.  

After the cancellation, I sent another message to the property to ask about the second payment. I asked them to investigate it and either reinstate my reservation or refund the paid amount. Within an hour they sent me a message simply stating the card was not working and that I should update my payment method. No acknowledgement that the first payment was received. I replied once again stating that two payment attempts were made, the first of which was successful, citing the bank screenshots from my original message to them.  

After two more days of no response, I sent a message to Booking.com customer support detailing the issue. I was told that I would get a response in 24 hours, but that time has now passed.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? What options do I have to resolve this matter and either restore my booking or get my money back?",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Booking/comments/1e66ufk/reservation_cancelled_after_double_payment_no/,2024-07-18 09:01:52,Booking.com

I discovered a second option on the app which was to cancel with a fee waiver request, which I took. I also contacted a rep via the messaging option on the reservation to push along the request. The rep eventually messaged and claimed that my reservation was cancelled with the fee waived. It still said the reservation was confirmed and that my cancellation with fee waiver was still pending an answer. After responding to the rep that it was still there they messaged that it was all set and it’s still there.

Booking,Booking has definitely been hacked!,"Hey guys

I got scammed today ([booking.com](https://booking.com)) and the following happened to me today:

**I received an email from** [**noreply@booking.com**](mailto:noreply@booking.com) with information about a current booking for which I would have to **verify** **my payment method**, otherwise the booking **might be canceled**. Of course, the first thing I did was check the URL, and as you can see in the screenshot, it starts with hpps://booking.reserveXXXX.com/3dsecure/XXXX16735?firstname=Markus&lastname... So everything is (**supposedly**) correct! The booking reservation is also **displayed correctly**, the date, the price, everything is correct. The only tiny anomalies are that there is only a single zero (tenths place) in the price, and that the country code does not use my location, but shows the first country in the selection list (see arrows).

What's shocking is that I **also received this message in the booking app!** It is therefore clear that booking.com was hacked. All links contained in the email led to booking.com, there were no spelling errors in the email, overall everything was credible.

As soon as I noticed the slow data transfer, I interrupted my WiFi and then immediately transferred my entire bank balance to another account. I then blocked the credit card and changed the password for my booking account. So I guess I was lucky this time.

Here I find several posts from users who have experienced similar things in the past. But apparently **Booking is doing absolutely nothing** about it. What kind of juice shop is this that **ignores the security** of its users to such an extent that it doesn't even disclose an obvious hack and thus protect users?

Guys, please spread this post to **draw attention to the security issues at Booking**. It's disgraceful that this company doesn't care whether user data is safe or not. The main thing is that the profit runs.

Good luck and take care, Markus

Booking,"Being held ""hostige"" between Booking and the real estate provider"," So I want to share my experience with booking.com, maybe it will help somebody and avoid a morbid situation I am in right now. 

This year I started traveling a lot and most of my bookings were great. For September I booked a place in Prague, this was a couple of weeks ago. It was cheap and near centre which was my only wish, most of the time I would be spending outside anyways. 2 days ago I received a message from the owner of the place I reserved, that my stay cannot be guaranteed that he is owned money from [booking.com](https://booking.com/) and if i want to stayed at the place I should call booking. My response was this is not my problem and if he has problem with Booking he or she should, settle the dispute with them. I did ask the owner to cancel my reservation i cannot do it myself since i would lose 500€ of my own money and i am not the problem. They didn't do that, or wish to do that, since I and my reservation is basically being held hostage in this miserable situation of two business partners unable to settle a dispute. 

I have written to Booking Customer support (message tab), first of all. You can only sent one thing and then you have to wait for their response for hours. I didn't know that, so my first sentence was just a quick info about the situation so i understand the customer support was clueless about all the details. Lesson learned I made a much longer message with details of the situation and that I wish for Booking to cancel my reservation, because I am being threatened by their partner to be left stranded in foreign city 1000 km away from home. They response was I should talk to the owner which is hilarious, to the person that is threatening me he won’t be able to guarantee what I already payed in advance.

After about 3 more messages and a separate customer support this time mail message they said they will ask the owner to cancel my reservation free of charge. Mind you every Customer service reply takes about 4-8 hours. Offcourse the owner rejected their request and said they (the Booking) are thieves and he is owned money so pay up. 

After that booking is nowhere, ignoring all of my messages. Now, I am sceptical about booking in my future travels thru Booking.com. They said they can't do anything for cancelation because of the owner's policy that i have to pay and to which I agreed to, and yes I did. But I did not agree to be threatened or to be used as a hostage in this situation and their priority should be customer satisfaction and safety, and this is no ordinary situation that I am stuck in. 

I hope this message finds someone, who was or will be in the same situation and for Booking to have a solution for their customers, we should not be exploited like this because of their business and financial failures.",6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Booking/comments/15brhek/being_held_hostige_between_booking_and_the_real/,2023-07-28 08:28:46,Booking.com

Booking,Booking home owners have our card details???,"So recently I found out that booking home and apartment owners can SEE all our credit card details!!!

It is also stated here:

I also confirmed this with one home owner.
They see:
Card number

What happens if a home owner decides to save all the details, and max the card a year later??

Booking,Asked to pay a security deposit through PayPal,"Hi,

I have recently booked a non refundable 10 people apartment in Canada through booking.com (for a total of almost $2000). Now the owner has asked me to transfer a security deposit of $1500 using their personal email on PayPal.   


They will give us the code to access the apartment only after we pay the security deposit. Since it is a practice I have never experienced before and it feels shady, I was wondering if it is normal practice on booking or I should be careful.

Booking,Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel talks about the Travel Rebound,"[Booking Holdings CEO Glenn Fogel talks about the Travel Rebound](https://candorium.com/news/20230109142217622/ceo-of-booking-com-parent-talks-about-travel-leadership?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=news_post_social&utm_term=daily_news&utm_content=news_post_kathi_02)

The travel recovery has boosted Booking Holdings Inc. to record quarterly earnings, and Wall Street expects the company to post even bigger profits this year.

The company, which operates its namesake website, Booking.com, plus Priceline, Kayak and other travel and dining sites, has earned $1.8 billion through the first three quarters of 2022. Customer bookings are running more than one-third ahead of the year-ago pace.

The stock, while finishing down 16% in 2022, is holding up much better than shares of rival online travel agencies.

CEO Glenn Fogel spoke recently to The Associated Press about whether the rebound in travel is sustainable, uncertainty about the economy, and his management style.

Booking,Withholding cheaper availability,"I‘m currently in a holiday location in Italy. I got there on a cheap flight and booked a hotel for the first few nights. The idea was to work from there and find other accommodation then (it’s an expensive area). Now that I’m here booking.com only shows at least twice as expensive accommodation availability. I asked the Hotel I’m staying at whether I could extend my stay. They said sure, but they’d just have to remove their availability from booking.com. To me Booking.com showed no availability for my current hotel.

However, last night we got a text from the owner saying that they made a mistake and double booked our cottage for part of our stay.

We booked our cottage back in June and have confirmation on email and everything. The owner apparently forgot to close those dates on [booking.com](https://booking.com) and the first 4 days of our stay were booked by someone else. 

The owner has said that cancelling with [booking.com](https://booking.com) is very hard for her  so she has offered to let us stay in a different room for 3 of those days, but the first day of our would-be stay she has no vacancy. 

What can we do? We definitely booked first and have confirmation of that, can we just insist on having the cottage we booked and make her deal with the other people?

Booking,Host cancels one day before check-in. ,"We booked an apartment via booking 2 months before our travel. One day before check-in the owner sends a message they can not accomodate us due to prolonging of other guests. Tells us we can cancel the reservation for free. We tell them we do not want to cancel and they should be the one cancelling. I send a message to booking support, but only bot responds someone will contact us within 24 hours. Can't wait that long, so I call booking support. Answering machine tells to enter reservation number. After entering it just keeps repeating and asking for reservation number. Tried several times. After googling found out reservation number is probably too long and the machine glitches out. Can't reach booking support via phone. I tell once again the host we do not want to cancel and if there is anything we can do to keep our reservation. It's not been canceled by host and booking shows if we cancel there is a cancellation fee. Sure host says we can cancel for free but we don't want that. Hosts ignores. We search for new accomodation and book one for the next days. After staying in the new apartment 36 hours later, during the night, 1 am I have received a call from booking singapore. Was sleeping, didn't hear the call. I'd imagine they know where I am due to the reservations (Bulgaria) so it's a weird call time. Late afternoon I get a message from booking they have canceled the reservation and they wish I've found a new place to stay. After that I've sent them messages if I could leave a review for the accomodation and if there are any compensation etc. but they don't respond anything anymore.

So all in all, booking accomodations from smaller hosts via booking is a bit risky and will avoid it in the future. There is basically no penalty for the host for cancelling reservations as they want. There is no way knowing if that is a common thing the host does. At least in airbnb there is an automated review saying the host canceled the reservation. Booking support is absolutely horrible and had not known it is that bad. After reading all reviews from the accomodation there is one saying the host changed their accomodation to another apartment, so it leaves me wondering if cancelling reservations is common for this property since booking doesn't punish in any way. 

Some days later I make an invoice for the property for the late cancellation and time spent looking for the new apartment. I don't expect to be paid but it's for a reminder they have done wrong. Send jt to booking and the host. Don't get any response anymore from anyone, no wonder though.

Wanted to share our experience. What makes it even worse is that we were hiking on mountains the day before check-in and did not really have time to look for a new place to stay. For us, we definitely will prefer airbnb from now on. Thanks for reading. ",5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Booking/comments/1fck60m/host_cancels_one_day_before_checkin/,2024-09-09 08:00:21,Airbnb

Vrbo,Scammed on Expedia Via VRBO Via 3rd Party,"So I booked a reservation for next March for a property in Florida on Expedia. It is through Expedia but the listing is VRBO. The cancellation policy says I can cancel anytime up to next March. I have been trying to cancel over and over again on VRBO but they say I need to contact the host since they use a 3rd party payment system (already paid the $3k). 

WELL COME TO FIND OUT THE LISTING WAS A SCAM! The phone number they provided was not real (area code was not a real area code) and they have not been responding to emails or DMs for over a month. VRBO says they cannot do anything and I have to file a claim with my CC company (I used Chase Reserve to book it). 

This whole thing is a nightmare and no one seems to care that it is a scam. It was hosted by Gulf Paradise Vacations LLC. Need more proof it is a scam? They use a photo of the Aria as the profile pic for the property (only showed up as the main photo after I booked). I also tried finding a working phone number for that company and various emails, but all the phone numbers are disconnected and the emails never go through.

Vrbo,Ruined family vacation ,"We booked almost a month in advance for a remote stay in VA. Six people, 40ish acres of land and convenient drive to national park/other attractions, July 3rd-8th. 

We were supposed to get check in details 3 days ahead. That rolls around and passes with multiple unanswered messages to host.

Day of, July 3rd, we finally get the instructions and our family members make the 5 hour drive to the property. They come to find a dilapidated, NO ELECTRICITY, smells-of-dead-bodies, very much disgusting house. It looks NOTHING like the listing photos and feels extremely unsafe. 
Of course, there is no cell service on site. Said family members have to drive out ~15 min to call and inform the rest of us. Then, the back and forth with vrbo gets started. 3 hours awful customer service later, my family members have no choice but to make the 5 drive hour home again. Having gotten up at 6am that day, not expecting a late night drive, they don't actually get home until the wee hours of the morning next day (4th of July). Our entire holiday was ruined. 

Yes, I got my money back. No, vrbo customer service were not helpful. The most infuriating thing is that the host never responded to my calls or called me back, despite the emergency; they simply sent a ""sorry for any inconvenience* message through the platform, knowing full well they ruined our annual vacation. Nor did vrbo offer any apology or incentive for continuing to use their platform beyond issuing a refund of their service fee and leaving the hefty remainder of the refund up to their ""trusted partner"" of a property management company with a 3rd party payment/billing system unrelated to vrbo. 

That listing is still up as of today, a full week later, on vrbo. Please beware. 

Sorry for the rant. Hope this helps someone else in their decision-making process for holiday rentals.

Vrbo,"If a host cancels hours before, should VRBO find you a replacement at no extra expense, or should the listing have a 30 day public warning?","Right now, a host can cancel last minute with no warning to future guests, and the guest that loses their reservation is left with useless VRBO chatbots and often extra costs. Should VRBO offer more to guests in these situations (with some maximum), or at least warn future reservations? Or what do you think should be done?

=====My details below, not needed to answer the question=====
Posting my details here in case others find themselves in a similar situation: booked 2 days before the trip, got ""instant confirmation"", and another confirmation + check-in info day before.

Hours before the reservation, after we landed, the host messaged: ""there was an error with the VRBO calendar syncing with their AirBNB calendar"" they accidentally double booked the place since ""both reservations were made almost at the same time""

So they cancelled ours since we booked slightly after the first group, said we'll get a refund, apologized, said we could try to find another place and warned hotels were very expensive. VRBO support was a useless chat bot. The only available place was 2x the capacity for 2x the cost and that was what we had to do. My hunch is there was no calendar sync error, they accidentally approved both and cancelled the cheaper listing. I know little change will probably happen from this post, so the hope is this post will encourage other users to post how unreliable the platform can be and maybe get the eyes of VRBO to make some changes.

Vrbo,Pet fees on Expedia,"I am a new VRBO host with a rental that allows for up to 2 dogs. Fee is $100 per dog, per stay. When we first listed on VRBO, I selected instant booking so that we could be cross-promoted on Expedia. 

We got our first booking but there was no mention of dogs or pet fee paid. A neighbor with a VRBO near us alerted us that the guest we just booked had contacted her for her house but she turned them down because she couldn’t accommodate their two dogs. I mentioned that the renter never said they had dogs. So I contacted the renter and asked them if they were bringing dogs so I could prepare the house accordingly. They said yes, two dogs. I told them there was a pet fee. They were ok with that, but mentioned they thought it was odd that our Expedia listing did not request a pet fee. 

I thought so too since our VRBO listing clearly states our pet fees. I contacted Expedia and they said, “oh the renter hadn’t selected the ‘paw’ icon to indicate they were bringing a dog, therefore the pet fee calculator didn’t kick in.” That seemed weird to me. 

I initiated a payment request and the renter paid it. 

But this was bugging me. I had no feeling that the renter was trying to pull a fast one. So I checked out Expedia, seeking homes that are pet friendly. In my own search, I found lots of homes that accepted dogs but when I went to proceed with “test booking” them, no pet fee window popped up. 

Now i am wondering if Expedia’s site and extra fee structure is messed up, leading to lots of awkward conversations and inaccurate accusations between hosts and guests re: pets. 

For now, I have removed instant booking from our VRBO listing so that I don’t have to deal with that. But I am disappointed that our property won’t be cross promoted in Expedia.

Vrbo,No Support for Renters of Infested $30k a Week Horror House,"I'm sharing this as a caution to anyone who thinks that VRBO is interested in protecting renters' interests.

Long Story Short is that my extended family made a late season decision to rent a large home for a week in a very expensive vacation area on the final week of the season.  The cost for this through VRBO was $30k and while that may seem crazy, it's inline with premium 6,000 sq ft with/pool rentals in the areas.

In the ad the home appeared older and a bit museum like with it's furnishing and decorations, but the pictures portrayed as a beautiful and classic mansion.  There were only four or five reviews, but all of them top notch.

Upon arrival it was clear that other than maybe the bathroom and beds, the home had not been seriously cleaned in months.  Cobwebs in every corner, dusty surfaces, vases full of rotting flowers.  One of the ""first floor"" bedrooms was actually in a musty scary basement and many of the basement rooms and first floor closets were full of old smelly clothes.

The kitchen was the real masterpiece with ants crawling over the dish racks, dirty dishes, and a mouse that was way too comfortable around people.  He seemed to live in the dishwasher.  Besides being generally run down and cluttered, highlights included an old drinking glass with maggoty fruit, random dirty laundry and a dirty diaper under the bed.  

We contacted the host , who told us the house was in tight top shape.  When we shared video evidence to contrary, she offered to refund a single night, but not leave as she would be sending cleaners and exterminators the next day.  Also that the mice were coming from next door and it wasn't her fault.  We were traveling with pets, babies and elderly people so of course this wasn't acceptable, we found other accommodations through a local broker immediately and left.

When contacting VRBO for a refund, we offered ample video and photographic evidence of the situation, but they seemed entirely unconcerned.  They were asking questions like ""was that the only mouse or did you see more?""  We asked them if they suggested we stay in the house when the exterminators arrive and they said that 'working that out and discussing refunds was between us and the owner.'  There was no hint of desire to help or any appreciation of the situation. They do not care about their brand or their customers experience.  They basically said ""it's up to you guys to work it out.""

Basically VRBO is great if it all works out, but if the property owner is a piece of garbage, they're not interested.

We ended up renting through a local real estate office and when we mentioned the property owner, who owns more than one dilapidated mansion, they knew exactly who we were talking about.  They had previously represented them, but refused their listings due to the poor upkeep of the properties and customer complaints.  VRBO obviously has no such standard.",63,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1f968tf/no_support_for_renters_of_infested_30k_a_week/,2024-09-04 22:14:08,Expedia
Vrbo,2 bedroom booked but there is just one. What would you expect to be done/refunded? Am i somehow being scammed?,"We arrived today to book into an apartment we payed for some months ago.  
There was a delay as the cleaners had taken off with the keys so we had to wait half an hour to be let in, so it was already off to a not great start!  As my partner unpacked the car i had a look round and then got him to check I wasn’t being daft and there really wasn’t a second bedroom. Nope - not my imagination. So i called the host who seemed entirely perplexed.  She apparently has no two bedroom apartments in this block. 

She has gone off to talk to VRBO but my question is - to hosts with several places - how easy is it to mix pictures and details?  It seems utterly bizarre to me that someone could have rentals listed with pictures and details for a different place, but even more so when some of the pictures do actually match - it seems to be the same kitchen, and the same rug in the main room but different sofas, and most importantly the pictures of two separate bedrooms. 

My partner is now on an inflatable bed in the main room. Im just about to go to bed but im ruminating about the oddness of all this. 

When i spoke to the owner she was very quick to explain where the airbed and bedding could be found, and said she would ensure we got “compensation “. Is this some strange scam, or just a genuine complete mixup?

Vrbo,Warning: Dealing with Scammers on VRBO – Terrible Experience with Host Harassment,"I wanted to share my frustrating and alarming experience with VRBO, in hopes of warning others about the growing number of scammers and unprofessional hosts on the platform.

Several weeks ago, I booked a villa through VRBO. After the booking, I had no communication from the host at all. I reached out multiple times, both through VRBO and even called customer service, but I was completely ignored. Weeks went by with no response, so I escalated the issue and eventually managed to get through to VRBO's chat support. After a lengthy conversation, they finally cancelled the booking for me.

However, this is where things took a dark turn. Just 6 HOURS after the cancellation, the host started harassing me. I received a series of messages where the host called me names, insulted me, and even made incredibly inappropriate comments, calling me a ""homosexual"" and telling me if I was ""a real man"" I should come and find him. It was disturbing and completely uncalled for.

I’m honestly shocked that VRBO would allow hosts like this to be on their platform. I’ve always thought of VRBO as a reputable service, but this experience has completely soured my opinion. I would strongly advise anyone to stay away from not just VRBO, but also related sites like Expedia and Fewo Direkt. I never imagined I’d deal with such unprofessionalism and harassment, and I’m just lucky I was able to get my booking canceled before it escalated further.

Please be cautious if you’re booking through these platforms. The lack of accountability and support in situations like mine is concerning, and I would hate for anyone else to go through something like this.

Vrbo,Long time VRBO owner and traveler considering closing account ,"I've literally been on VRBO for over 20 years. First I was an owner with a ski condo in Breckenridge, Colorado. All of my experiences were good. I sold the condo and became a renter. Things have steadily gone down hill. 

Owners, tell me if these things can be avoided/fixed and I might try booking again. Right now, after talking to a condescending British man on the customer service line, I'm close to done. 

(1) How do I get the filters to work? I set my price at $1000/night and the site still shows me properties up to $7000/night. Uh, no, you're not going to tempt me to spend more.

(2) I selected 2 bedrooms but the site keeps showing me studios and one bedrooms. Yes, there are 2 bedrooms available, so it isn't an inventory issue.

(3) Why can't we get at least the cross streets for properties? Tonight every listing had a gigantic black circle covering its location on the map. We used to be able to zoom in on the exact building. This is really important for skiing. Nobody wants to have to walk half a mile in ski boots. From experience, I don't go by the descriptions in the listings. There are property managers that will claim a rental is ski in/out when it really isn't. I need to be able zoom in on the map to see exactly how I would get to the lift or bus.

(4) Why don't the property managers fix the things the previous renters said are bad? A mattress for example. If three previous renters wrote reviews saying the mattress is sagging, then the owner should replace it IMO. I did when I was an owner. And, oh, the useless politician remarks from the property managers. Those are infuriating. 

(5) Is there a way to filter out property management companies that you have already had bad experiences with? I despise Vacasa and will never again stay at a property managed by them. I know I probably have to just keep scrolling to the bottom of every listing. Just hoping there is a better way. 

  
Thanks for listening to my rant. If anyone knows someone at VRBO that I could speak with that won't treat me like a child, please let me know. 😊",4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1gtyreg/long_time_vrbo_owner_and_traveler_considering/,2024-11-18 06:38:42,Expedia

Or just give up?",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1gk6k9x/trouble_with_refund/,2024-11-05 13:23:50,Expedia
Vrbo,Nightmare with Cancellation Attempt,"**UPDATE:** 

I searched ways to get a refund and found a thread on Reddit. It suggested everything from leaving negative reviews and calling local authorities to suing the host. I messaged the host this morning and told them I would give them until the end of day to process a refund before I would be contacting local authorities to visit their addresses, send a letter to their congressman, and leave negative reviews if possible.

I am unable to leave reviews because I haven't officially stayed at the VRBOs. 

Yesterday I was walked through the cancellation process on the phone by VRBO support. They instructed me to got to the trips and click ""Cancel Booking"". When I did, nothing happened. I right clicked the button and nothing indicating it was an active hyperlink appeared. See the same info for the ""message host"" button below where everything is active.

[Inactive Button Link](https://preview.redd.it/021btggnpr4d1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=841283622d423874a91e83f77a5612e38cd2ac5c)

After I gave the host this ultimatum, they finally responded. VRBO support called me. I once again had to explain the reasoning and asked for assistance in cancelling. I explained that I could not cancel on my end and the host said they could not cancel on theirs.

In order to resolve, VRBO support asked for permission to take over control of my account. I granted and once they did, they messaged the seller as me and provided a reason for cancellation. The reason being, ""Amenities"".  Once they sent that message, both listings were magically canceled, meaning it was 100% in the host's control to cancel the listings all along.

I was informed refunds would be the responsibility of the host and could take 5-7 business days. Shortly after, I got a new type of message in my chats with the host. They were bolded and said refunds were being processed and would take up to 15 days.

The host tried to scold me for my hostility and continually tried to pin the blame on me. I reminded them that I booked their available listing and had been trying for nearly a week to get answers. Only when I threatened legal action did I receive any movement.

I received emails stating that refunds were being processed. It should not have taken this long or involved this many phone calls, chat sessions, and emails. VRBO support is essentially an endless loop of people who can't actually help and won't provide information regarding escalation or supervisorial contact.

I highly suggest avoiding VRBO. I thought since they were owned by Expedia, that their might be some extra vetting and validity to their properties but it is just as easily scammed as AirBNB. Don't make the mistakes I did. 

**ORIGINAL STORY:**

I booked an available VRBO last week. Within 2 minutes of booking, the host contacted me to say the site was unavailable on the dates I selected. I went to cancel, and it said I had 1 day to cancel to earn a 50% refund. If I did not cancel within a day, I would receive no refund.

After I explained that to the host and asked her to cancel on her end and offer a full refund due to her error, she ghosted me.

In the meantime, I booked another site nearby. This is where I did something dumb and failed to look at the host. It was the same host as the first site. After I booked, I got a confirmation but no message. I reached out and she gave the same excuse that the site was unavailable and that VRBO had been contacted.

Again she stopped responding to my messages.

I called VRBO and spoke to a person in support. I explained the situation and she told me I was ineligible for a full refund but that she would get the host on the other line to get her to process the cancellation and refund.

After some back and forth, she informed me that the host disconnected from the call. She would be escalating my complaint to the specialist team to help resolve the situation. In the meantime, I filed a dispute with my card company to reverse the charges.

The support person gave me a Case # and told me I'd be emailed with further instructions.

I just received an email that asked me to complete a survey for my closed case. The case number in that email did not match the one I was given over the phone.

I filled out the survey explaining the situation again and asked to be contacted via phone to resolve. I've also reported the host via VRBO's ""Neighborly Complaint"" form as a likely scammer.

I'll own my mistake of blindly booking a second VRBO, but I was in a hurry to get a spot with a good location and made an honest mistake. The rest of this is all on VRBO and it is absolutely wild to me that they are unable to process a refund for what is at best a clear error on their/their host's end and, at worst, a scam.

If anyone was give Case # 127953103 and spoke with **Lorie,** I received an email asking you to complete a feedback survey. This was not my Case #.

Also, if anyone has dealt with this situation before and figured out a way to get it resolved, I'd love to hear what you did so I can get my $1000 back.

One thing's for certain, I'll never use VRBO again.",11,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1d86p4k/nightmare_with_cancellation_attempt/,2024-06-04 20:05:54,Expedia

We called VRBO and asked to cancel the rest of the stay and move elsewhere. I couldnt find anything we liked on VRBO so I went to AirBnB and found a place and we took it. VRBO did agree that the stay did meet the requirements under their book with confidence guarantee, but they said it needs to be through VRBO, expedia,  or a hotel.

Vrbo,Another Warning About Horrible VRBO Customer Service,"Back in October 2023, I booked a large estate for 35 people in April 2024. The estate was on an island in the Caribbean, and I was in contact with the hosts for boat taxi transportation for weeks leading up to the trip. They were well aware of the group size.

Upon arrival, the estate had no running water of any kind, no AC as promised, no WiFi as promised, and the hosts lived on-site. Our only source of drinking water was bottled water that could be purchased from the hosts (which they ran out of within 2 hours). The hosts told us the water would be fixed in 24 hours... When the pump ship came around the next day. They'd forgotten to fill the reservoir tanks 🤯  I called VRBO customer service stressed the unhealthy situation we were in. I wanted help rebooking and for any extra costs of rebooking to be covered.

The agent stated they would open a case, but they weren't able to assist in rebooking our group. The agent called the hosts and they didn't pick up. The agent then emailed the hosts and told them our issues while we were on-site. The hosts confronted us and were pissed at us for not giving them time to fix the issues they could fix. Regardless, it was 100 degrees and it's not like the hosts can find AC units or help us rebook to a new place.

I had to rebook as many people as possible using Airbnb, hotels, and whatever else that was available. About 10 people still ended up staying at the original lodging due to no vacancy elsewhere. The hosts were onsite the whole time and clearly made us feel unwelcome now. My birthday party was totally altered.

After the trip ended, I called back VRBO and was told my complaint was closed because the host did not provide any comments on the situation. I was like ""so that should be a given that my side of the story is as described."" Instead, the agent said that only the host can give a refund and that VRBO can only reach back out to the host to pass on my complaints and ask for a refund. The agent said I'm only entitled to the amount of the original stay. Nothing for the extra amounts I spent on rebooking day-of.

Anyways, it's now been over two weeks of back and forth with Expedia Group / VRBO, seven different reps that I need to explain the situation to each time, the same protocol of VRBO reaching out to the host, never getting a response from the host, and then VRBO agent stating there is no method to escalate internally at VRBO to get a refund. FINALLY, I got an agent that said they could escalate internally for review, but that best case would be a refund for the original VRBO amount. No refunds for extra amounts on the day-of bookings. At this point, I've chalked it up to a lesson learned and to be happy with whatever I can get. Fingers crossed this internal escalation actually does something.

I made the decision to leave to keep myself and daughter safe. Upon getting home I continued to try to reach the host/ Vrbo to no avails. 

I made the next decision to put a charge back order on my credit card to prevent me from incurring any fraudulent charges and sent an email to Vrbo explaining how I felt they were negligent in providing emergency information during a potentially fatal hurricane. 
The response I got is where I m confused and I’ll post below: could someone help me understand what they are saying and any advice about the charge back and where to go from here would be appreciated! 

Response:

We acknowledge how frustrating it is to have your travel plans disrupted, especially after putting so much effort into selecting the perfect vacation rental for the holidays. We want to provide the following steps to guide you in choosing alternative accommodation for the duration of your stay.
Please book accommodation within our Expedia network (Vrbo.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, or directly at the hotel).
If no accommodations are available via the Expedia Network, you may walk into any available hotel and book directly. Please note that we do not reimburse a reservation made on a competitor site.
You will need to pay upfront and a reimbursement may be provided should it fulfill our Book with Confidence program. You may book new reservation up to $13,212.075 and we will reimburse you for the price difference between your cancelled reservation and new reservation up to $4,404.025. When you are denied entry or a host cancels your reservation, you are entitled to a full refund of that reservation, and we will be working to ensure this is provided if it has not already been initiated. We do not include refundable deposits, incidentals, or additional accommodation requests when calculating your reimbursement amount. Your new reservation must be for the same number of guests/pets as your original reservation. Should you require rebooking assistance, a new case will be created with our Claims Team, and they will be reaching out to you by email to collect information regarding potential reimbursement of overages. Once received use the Claims Team email to contact us, as this case will be closed and no longer monitored. Please be prepared to provide the Claims Team with the following documentation:
A copy of your government-issued photo ID. If you did not pay for the reservation, please provide a copy of the payer's current government-issued photo ID, as well as your own.
A copy of the itemized hotel receipt or folio.
A copy of your payment information (bank statement and proof of payment or canceled check) showing the hotel charge clearing your account.
You have six (6) months from the first day of the reservation to complete the claim process with all requested documentation. Any claim submitted after this period will be denied. You may review the full Book with Confidence terms here.If you require any further assistance, please contact us at Vrbo United States

Vrbo,"Owner asking me to agree to a ""cancellation release"" 4 days after booking","Is this a real thing? I booked a Vrbo apartment for a long-term stay for an internship, and the host messaged me saying the apartment is not available and he's not sure why Vrbo automatically accepted it. He's trying to get me to agree to a ""cancellation release"" so neither of us gets charged. The last day to cancel the booking was the day before he messaged me, and even that carried a penalty. Is this some sort of scam? I can't find anything online about a cancellation relase or anything of the sort. I'm worried that if I agree to this via text it'll be treated as if I requested a cancellation, and then I'll be on the hook for all or part of the booking fees.

Update: The situation is resolved. Told owner I cannot agree to a release without seeing it in writing. He contacted Vrbo support, who in turn contacted me, canceled the booking on their end, and issued a refund.

However, in the last six months, I haven’t had a single booking from VRBO from either property. Meanwhile, I get tons from the other platforms.. I tried to talk to their overseas support and all they tell you is lower your prices and cleaning fee. But I already charge less than what it cost me to get them cleaned.

Vrbo,Will allowing pets really boost our bookings with VRBO?,"Prior to September of last year, which also coincides with our change in property managers, we had no shortage of bookings through VRBO. Since September we have had no bookings through VRBO. Granted our bookings are down across-the-board but absolutely none from VRBO. We have discussed this matter with the property management company, and they have gone round and round with VRBO without getting too many answers. This company has a partnership with VRBO and has over 22,000 properties listed with them .Had another meeting with the property managers today about VRBO and one suggestion they had was that we consider allowing pets. They claim that part of the reason people turn to STRs is because they want to bring their pets. My husband wants to try allowing them to see what happens. I am less enthusiastic about this idea. What are others experiences with this as a method to increase bookings?",5,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1cciep2/will_allowing_pets_really_boost_our_bookings_with/,2024-04-25 03:54:06,Expedia
Vrbo,Is VRBO giving up?,"I want to start off by saying that this is anecdotal; This is my experience as a host on VRBO for almost 10 years now. I have 2 homes and I co-host 6 cabins in the Big Bear. Not only have the rentals significantly reduced but the page views are down tremendously. I get the feeling Expedia is abandoning it in favor of their platform. The Big Bear cabins are killing it on Expedia. 

What does VRBO actually offer that is any different from Airbnb now? They have pretty much adopted the same business model so now it's just as expensive to rent on that platform. Now it only comes down to user experience and I think Airbnb has them beat. I realize some of you are on the old model (pay per year) but that is not a choice for a lot of us. 

As a host, I'm constantly receiving scam inquiries. I never get them on Airbnb. When I receive a legitimate request, most guests have zero reviews. It's scarier for me to rent on VRBO. Airbnb vets the guest more. Again, this is my experience. 

If VRBO wants to get back in the game, I suggest not charging such a high %. Undercut Airbnb and their ridiculous 12% guest fee.  They used to be the top dog, then Airbnb kicked them in the pants and they decided the best thing to do is copy Airbnb. I remember when it was just a marketplace. They connected you to the host and then they were out. I honestly think that model would kill right now in this economy. People want to take trips but they are sick of all of the fees.

Vrbo,"Host scam: VRBO does not protect against blatant fraud, or stand behind ""Book with Confidence"" guarantee","**Host scam**:  a popular timeshare resort had multiple listings on VRBO.  We decided to use VRBO for the first time and reserved one.

About three weeks before the stay was to start, the host suddenly cancelled the reservation, strangely stating that we were the ones that had cancelled.  I assured him this was not the case.  The host became non-responsive and did not offer or provide a refund.  

This occurred 2+ months ago.  I have interacted with no less than a dozen VRBO support agents since then about this case--on the phone, in chat, via email.  The agents that reviewed the correspondence all agree a full refund is due to us, as VRBO's own records indicated the owner/host cancelled.

This case couldn't be any clearer.  VRBO also then removed the host and all his listings.  Despite the scam, has VRBO issued a refund to me?  No.  Did VRBO stand behind its ""Book with Confidence"" guarantee?  Not at all.  From VRBO's website,  ""Our customer support team is available 24/7 to assist with: 

**""Payment protection**: In the unlikely event of fraud or if the owner wrongfully withholds your damage deposit.""  -->No.  Every agent I have interacted with states a refund is due, and that the host/listing was suspicious.  However, nothing has been done by VRBO beyond attempting to reach the host.  No one will follow up with me.  VRBO outsources customer service, so the agents I interact with are polite, but unable to do anything except refer to various 'VRBO departments'.

**""Owner cancellation:** If the owner unexpectedly cancels your reservation within 30 days of your stay, we’ll help you find a comparable property.""  -->No.  The owner/host canceled within 21 days, and I asked a VRBO agent to help us rebook as per their guarantee.  He declined, encouraging me to re-book myself, on their system, BEFORE the refund would be received.  Absolutely not, especially with a $5,000+ refund already owed.

VRBO stands behind nothing.  It was my first and last time booking with them (nor will I book again with Expedia, VRBO's owner).  Instead of rebooking with VRBO, I used Redweek for the first time, and had a very good experience--they withhold payment until the guest checks in, avoiding fraud like this.  VRBO is letting scammers on, and using us/their customers to find them--at our own expense.",32,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/zyksxj/host_scam_vrbo_does_not_protect_against_blatant/,2022-12-29 23:56:28,Expedia

Vrbo,Book with Confidence Guarantee Taking Forever,"We had booked a VRBO in San Diego for 8/12-8/16. On 8/8 the host canceled the reservation due to losing her license from the city. I called into VRBO and was finally connected with Jim in the VRBO rebooking team. He told us we had 3 options (email sent to us to confirm). 1. Book another property or hotel within their Expedia Network. 2. Hotel stay or 3. work with rebooking team to find a new vacation property. I did a combination of 1 and 3 by having them find us a place and we rebooked in the app for a new property. The difference in price was about 1,260 dollars. 

Jim opened a ticket with the Guarantee team that day and I sent over a copy of the ID for the booking and he confirmed it was received. 

We get back from the stay and still nothing has been communicated to us on the refund. I called in and they said someone would get back to us. No one ever did of course. This went on until 9/2 I think when they said the prior ticket was closed but she was opening a new ticket. 

Every time I call in  I only get ""we'll escalate"" and nothing happens. We are now almost to 2 months since the original ticket and a month past the second ticket. 

Am I bet just to dispute the non-refund with the credit card company? At this point I'll not use VRBO ever again but don't want to be out the $1,260.

Vrbo,I thought Airbnb was bad. Then I booked with VRBO.,"I have had my share of not-so-great experiences with Airbnb but in the end, they always came through, although you have to spend hours on phone with them.

VRBO seems 1000 times worse than Airbnb. We booked a vacation rental in Hawaii using VRBO and were eagerly looking forward to it. Once we checked in the house was in a horrible condition. It looked as if it was not cleaned between guests. There were roaches in dishwasher, hair on the floor, unflushed toilet paper, food particles all over the countertop, unclean/used towels. We immediately alerted the host and VRBO. We sent 30+ photos and videos of roach sightings. I was communicating with the host via VRBO chat so I can have record of everything. The host agreed that their regular cleaners were out of town and she doesn't know if the temp cleaners did the cleaning or not. The host said that she can't schedule the cleaners until the next one or two days. We refused with that resolution as we didn't want to stay in a dirty house.

VRBO said that they would provide alternative accommodation until the house gets cleaned. The host agreed to change the reservation to start on the next day so we don't be charged for that one night we can't stay. We left the keys inside the home and left the house waiting for VRBO to send us alternative accommodation details. We waited for couple of hours and had to call back as it was almost close to 10 PM. Keep in mind that we left the keys inside the house and at this point we don't have the keys to the vacation home anymore.

We called VRBO again to see what happened to our alternative accommodation. The new agent we spoke to says that what was told to me was not the standard procedure. They said that the VRBO has to confirm with the host regarding the 1-night refund. We told the agent that the host agreed to it on the chat and the previous agent told us they will find us alternative accommodation. The new agent refused to do anything as she was trying to contact the host to get 1 night cancellation confirmation. It was past midnight where the host lives so the host didn't respond. By this time, it was almost midnight where we were. The agent kept telling me that we can't get alternate accommodation. We informed the agent that we don't even have the keys to get it. At this point the agent said that VRBO can't provide alternative accommodation but can reimburse us for up to $150 and that we have to make our own booking. We were in Hawaii and there was absolutely nothing available for under $1000 a night. I don't understand how VRBO can leave their customers stranded in the middle of the night.

It is ridiculous that they offered $150 in the first place. What makes it worse that it came with so many conditions that it is impossible to get that $150. The requirements were that I need to book with Expedia or [Hotels.com](https://hotels.com/) or directly with the hotel. If I found accommodation on any other 3rd party website or any of the credit card portals, then they wouldn't reimburse $150.

It is beyond my comprehension how VRBO is still in business. We ended up cancelling the accommodation as the host couldn't promise the house would be cleaned in a timely manner as their regular cleaners were out of town. VRBO refused to help as they said that the host agreed to clean the house ""at some point"" during our stay. VRBO also said that they require proof of multiple roach sightings to consider the home unsanitary. I was only able to send 6 different roach sighting videos as every time I open a cabinet door or dishwasher, roaches run so fast that it's impossible to catch them on video. Apparently 6 sightings is not enough proof. Since the listing was cancelled, I can't even write a review.

I got all of my money back as the host agreed to cancel but we lost almost 1 whole day in our 10-day vacation and also had to spend \~5x the original amount to find last minute accommodation.

I made a reservation and paid the rental fee.  The owner didn't send me access information.  I called them the day before I traveled, and they told me that the condo was double-booked and not available.  They said they would send me a refund.  I kept my reservation open (since it indicated that I could not cancel and get a refund).

Fast forward a couple of weeks - no refund, landlord has ghosted me, and VRBO is telling me that all they can do is contact the landlord on my behalf.  The rental fee was $570, so not the end of the world, but a reminder that if someone wants to defraud you on VRBO, it is very easy for them to do so.

Vrbo,"VRBO hasn’t paid me for my bookings in months, you can’t reach them or talk to anyone and now they aren’t answering my emails or phone calls.","I had just gotten done talking to an Expedia group representative who apparently was my account manager. I shared with him the fact that I did think VRBO was superior to the other booking sites. Primarily because there’s insurance to give the host some measure of protection. 

I’ve had damages and issues with the other booking company and we all know who that is and they never protect you and I haven’t gotten payments for any of the issues. Even with proof on camera they go back to the renter and if the renter denies anything they go back to you and say sorry you’ll have to work it out with the renter. 
Horrible horrible horrible host protection so VRBO really has been my go to and my primary source of income as a rental property platform.

Fast forward shortly after speaking with my so-called account manager VRBO stops paying me. I’m on my seventh booking as I write this and have more reservations in place but they haven’t paid me since the beginning of the summer. 

Second week in July, I was changing bank accounts over to an LLC and they kept blaming everything on that. The site just keeps sending me W-9 forms which have been filled out over and over and over again. I’ve sent billing copies of my EIN federal form verifying names and numbers but nothing but more triggers to fill out the stupid form. Even the phone agents filled it out for me on their end thinking it was some technical issue on my end but that didn’t work either. It’s really a bunch of BS because the payments stopped coming a number of bookings before I even tried to change my bank account number. 

The helpdesk are a bunch of international people sitting at home answering calls and they have to email billing. My account had about 20 priorities before I ever got a single email from billing. The billing specialist couldn’t do anything and sent it over to the tax department. I have yet to hear anything from the tax department as days and weeks slip by. They designed it so no one can be reached directly and there’s no one to personally speak with so there’s an untouchable feeling, horrible customer relations.  

I’ve emailed and called my so-called account manager with absolutely not one response back. And I just wait and hope that they pay me because I live off of these funds and it’s getting pretty desperate now. I figured I’d start to go to social media and maybe the press and legal if I have to but it just feels hopeless. Not one word of explanation or feedback about what’s happening. The site just keep sending the W9 form to me and I just keep filling it out over and over and over and over and over again. No one knows anything in any of the departments and there’s no one to talk to and now they stopped answering my emails. I hate to think I have to get an attorney on this but maybe that’s what has to happen. 

I used to be one of their biggest fans and when things are working well and smoothly no problem but God help you should you run into any difficulties you’re on your own because you won’t be able to find a single person to help you or give a damn.

Vrbo,Avoid Vrbo (the company) at all cost,"So here is the fiasco that has been my experience with Vrbo.

They are a company owned by Expedia. I have used Orbitz (also owned by Expedia) to book my travel and accommodations ever since I started traveling. 

I booked an accommodation through Orbitz that was managed by Vrbo in Kharkiv, Ukraine for December 30th-January 7th. The initial booking I had was canceled by the property owner due to a busted pipe and I had to find another place to stay. I again booked through Orbitz and the listing was managed by Vrbo. A few days before I left for my trip I noticed that the address for where I was staying was the same place that I had stayed at during my previous trip to Ukraine. The property owner contacted me on Whatsapp because apparently Vrbo alerts property owners when someone looks at their listing, (I had viewed his listing but booked a different one that the map showed in a different location) and he asked me if I was trying to book it. That's when he told me that the listing I had was not him and that I would have to pay him to stay there in cash.

So I contacted Vrbo's customer support and tell them the situation. They said that the would have it resolved within 24-48 hours. They didn't. I probably contacted them at least 12 times over 4 days trying to get it resolved. One day alone i called and was disconnected 11 times, they called back once. I literally called them at the actual property and told them that the only way I would be able to stay at the property was to pay cash. 

So now after a week from my initial call, they FINALLY send me an email....asking if I am still having issues with my booking. If I had waited on them to fix this mess I would still be out on the street. I literally called them the 31st, told them that I had to pay the equivalent of $285 to stay at the property, and 4 days later they ask if I still have a problem. Uh, DUH I still freaking do. Every time I contacted them they kept telling hiw my booking is backed by their guarantee, which in my personal experience, is completely meaningless. 

So screw Vrbo (the company) and their customer ""support""",16,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/rvy0ay/avoid_vrbo_the_company_at_all_cost/,2022-01-04 16:13:15,Expedia

I'm sure this is a common gripe here, but OH MY GOD the fees are ridiculous. No need for examples, I'm sure. I've known this for a while but it's become crystal clear while planning an upcoming Hawaii stay. VRBO used to be better than some others but, anecdotally, since their Expedia acquisition several years ago fees have gone way up.

I'm looking for a service/website/something that connets me directly to a property owner so I can pay *them*. No middle man. Or at least, a middle man that makes their money some way *other than* charging flavors of 'service fees'.

I realize this may be very difficult to find (impossible?) since the major players *do* perform a valuable service of at least surfacing the properties for me as a renter to select from -- most property owners don't have a website or any way of the public reaching them, and search results are all dominated by big players. Without happening to know someone where I'm staying, I'm stuck with whatever results the internet provides me.

We called VRBO and they said they can fight the chargeback but they cannot cancel the booking if they want us to fight the chargeback or they can cancel the booking but it means we would not be able to fight the chargeback. This booking was through Expedia.

It seems to me we should cancel the booking and try to get the dates rebooked. What would you do in this situation?

My wife and I recently started renting our photo studio house (really classy 115-year-old Victorian house) on Airbnb. Things have gone great so far. While we do offer individual room rentals during the week, we have been surprised that most of our bookings have been for the full house.  Someone mentioned to me that I should double post on VRBO as well, so I thought I would look into it.

Our general concern is about ensuring that there are no parties and that the house is well cared for. We are not in a big vacation spot or party city (suburb of St Louis), and almost all of our rentals so far have been families meeting in a central location or people in town for a conference at the convention center.

Vrbo,Booking was a boarded up building ,"We booked a place in LA, and when we arrived, the building was boarded up, and the gate to access the flat had a refrigerator blocking the door. 

While we were standing there, a person came by and said he was ""just driving by, but worked for the rental agency, and wanted to know if we needed help"". 

He said he didn't know this flat was in this condition, but that it wasn't supposed to be listed. 

And then offered to switch us to another flat, and that a different person would call us with details. 
Neither person was the person named as the contact for the rental. 

As the other rental was in a totally different area, and did not meet our needs, we declined. 

And contacted vrbo customer support. 
Wow, what a travesty of customer service. 

First agent had us send pictures and bank statement of proof of payment, and then said, let me transfer you... (The first call was 90 minutes)
And then another person gets on, seemingly with all our info, but very antagonist. 

And we had to explain every again. 
All the while, we are sitting in our car in LA, and its getting later and later. 

At the end, they said, we have to reach out to the agency that listed the property with us, for them to refund the money. 
2hr and 45 minutes from the beginning. 
And they could offer no help with getting another same day rental. 

Still waiting on the refund 
Its two days later now, and no word from them. 


As a very frequent traveler, Id say this has been one of the biggest bummers Ive encountered while travelling. 

Would not recommend.

Vrbo,Ruined family vacation ,"We booked almost a month in advance for a remote stay in VA. Six people, 40ish acres of land and convenient drive to national park/other attractions, July 3rd-8th. 

We were supposed to get check in details 3 days ahead. That rolls around and passes with multiple unanswered messages to host.

Day of, July 3rd, we finally get the instructions and our family members make the 5 hour drive to the property. They come to find a dilapidated, NO ELECTRICITY, smells-of-dead-bodies, very much disgusting house. It looks NOTHING like the listing photos and feels extremely unsafe. 
Of course, there is no cell service on site. Said family members have to drive out ~15 min to call and inform the rest of us. Then, the back and forth with vrbo gets started. 3 hours awful customer service later, my family members have no choice but to make the 5 drive hour home again. Having gotten up at 6am that day, not expecting a late night drive, they don't actually get home until the wee hours of the morning next day (4th of July). Our entire holiday was ruined. 

Yes, I got my money back. No, vrbo customer service were not helpful. The most infuriating thing is that the host never responded to my calls or called me back, despite the emergency; they simply sent a ""sorry for any inconvenience* message through the platform, knowing full well they ruined our annual vacation. Nor did vrbo offer any apology or incentive for continuing to use their platform beyond issuing a refund of their service fee and leaving the hefty remainder of the refund up to their ""trusted partner"" of a property management company with a 3rd party payment/billing system unrelated to vrbo. 

That listing is still up as of today, a full week later, on vrbo. Please beware. 

Sorry for the rant. Hope this helps someone else in their decision-making process for holiday rentals.

Vrbo,Will my structure be deleted from Booking.com affiliate partner websites if I delete my structure Booking.com ?,"Hello everyone,

We own a guest house in Italy, but we decided to be published only on AirBnb, plus our own website. This summer we decided to open on Booking.com as well; so we did and instantly got published on thousands of other websites. I did some researching and found out that:

""When you join Booking.com, you’ll benefit from extensive advertising. You **may** also appear on one — or more — of our 17,500+ affiliate partner websites""

Also reading froom Booking guidelines:

""**Can I remove my property from an affiliate website?**

It’s not currently possible to opt out of this service""

&#x200B;

Now, 6 months have passed and we got dozens of reservations from AirBnb, a few directly from our website and an absolute **ZERO** from Booking. And since we opened on Booking, the number of reservations coming directly from our website kinda dropped, I'm assuming that the reason is because we now appear on the infamous google second page, while before registering on Booking, we listed as the second result in our local zone (first one was AirBnb).

Of course we would like to stay on Booking, we know it could be a showcase (we're getting hundreds of views, despite no reservations). Maybe people find us there and try to get to us directly (maybe for a discount), BUT since we have to evidence on the positive aspect, perhaps it would be best to opt out of Booking completely, but we'd like to be certain that we will also be removed from affiliate partner websites as well. Do someone have some experience on the matter? Will we got rid of this websites?

&#x200B;

I know that zero reservations on Booking is weird, we think to have set up our listing well, description and price is equal to AirBnb and looking for our local zone, the price is ofter the lowest, we get a lot of clicks, still it seems like it is no use for us.

Vrbo,Dirty sheets in 2 rooms - or am I insane?,"EDITED: photos added to bottom of post

Hi guys,

So, I booked a Vrbo (only because my credit card offered me a 15% cash refund) in a major city for an event this weekend. It was cheap so I wasn't upset about the hair on the table next to the bed or the dusty floors and windows and weird yellow-stained walls. 

What did get me was that there was hair all over the sheets. 

Short, long, dark, light. Like on the pillow cases and the flat sheet and the fitted sheet. The sheets didn't even really look changed -- there was kind of that body-shaped yellowish stain that happens. But it wouldn't show on the pictures so I just said the sheets were not cleaned, full of hair. Sent 4 pictures of 7 different hairs. 

Host will not answer on Vrbo -- only answers on text message. I send screenshots of all the messages as well as the pictures through the Vrbo chat, you know, for cataloging. 

Host's response is: ""we have no staff on site, we'll fix this tomorrow morning."" I replied: ""TOMORROW MORNING? WHERE WILL I SLEEP?"" I didn't mean to type in caps, but it did accurately reflect how I felt inside. 

Go back and forth with the host. They offer me another room, send me a Google drive link to a video of the other room. They say I can sleep there until my sheets can be changed. I said ""I would be fine with this if the sheets are clean. What if they are not?""

Host just says, video shows room is clean. I say ok I will check it. Go into next room aaaaand...

There is even MORE hair. At least the bed didn't look slept in. But there is a LOT of hair. I took 12 pictures then gave up. There is even more variety this time. Sent to host. I said, ""you have to understand where I'm coming from. Would you sleep in a bed full of other people's hair?""

Host says, ""I am doing all I can within my limitations. I said, ""hard to believe a reasonable request like clean sheets is beyond your limitations.""

""We're a simple operation, we can only do so much."" I said I would have brought my own sheets if I knew there wouldn't be clean ones, this is very basic no matter how small you are! I say I will chargeback.

They offer me $10. $10? I couldn't even buy clean sheets myself for that much! 

The whole time Vrbo claims they are ""investigating."" I message the host and say I am leaving and I hope the representative can get a job where she isn't scamming people. They didn't answer. 

I contacted Vrbo again and said I want a refund, I won't stay, they offered me $10 and no clean sheets. Vrbo says: ""we're investigating.""

The kicker: the host claims in the listing that if you report an issue before 4pm it will be resolved the same day. I reported it at 2:45pm (check in was 3pm but they gave me the code early and it worked). Why even say that if you won't do it?

Don't book with Vrbo. This is insane. Clean sheets are like vacation rental 050 -- you know, those remedial courses you take if you failed math in high school and want to take the gen eds in community college. 

I didn't even want a refund, just a clean place to stay. But if they won't clean the space I cannot stay there. So I am on the train home now, because I cannot afford another place to stay without a refund, and I have a feeling Vrbo won't issue me anything. 

I mean am I insane? Would you stay in a bed full of hair? Is it ridiculous to expect a clean bed if that's essentially the only thing I paid for? Either way, I am very defeated. I will NEVER use Vrbo again.


Edit: They just sent me a message that my check out date is tomorrow. I am actually booked until the 8th. Screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/MHwAmDZ

editing again: people keep saying ""oh they need to investigate."" I'm sorry, how can an investigation into whether the sheets are clean or not take over 24hrs? I have now uploaded the photos I have submitted to both the host and VRBO.

Vrbo,VRBO Host threatening Small Claims litigation based on 3/5 review,"This is a long one, so TLDR (questions below): Booked in February for a April stay at VRBO. Host contacts me shortly before rentals with additional instructions to read and acknowledge. Stay comes and goes. Place is whack, but fine enough and as expected. Leave 3/5 review. 4 months pass and owner begins harassing me about the review and threatens litigation. VRBO support engaged. Owner escalates to filled out court forms that have yet to be filed claiming $500 + $2665 in lost revenue.

I booked a place in Washington for me and my extended family on mid-February, for stay at end of April. Booking process was easy, completely done through VRBO.

Roughly a week out from our stay, I get a text from the owner asking to go over some information related to the place. When I indicate I'm available to go over this information, I'm presented with 2 pictures of letter-sized printed out documents to read and then acknowledge that I've read and understand.

The first document is a description of the place with a few items about house rules, such as make sure the dishwasher is run and emptied before leaving, contact the host with any needs/problems rather than leaving a negative review, and a hand written bit about not charging a security deposit, but reserving the right to retroactively claim a security deposit if policies and instructions on VRBO and in these texted documents are not followed (these last two in particular will come into play later).

The second document is a tirade on how the house is not updated, go somewhere else if you want a upscale experience. Essentially a ""lower your expectations"" message. Sure whatever, not going to try and find a new location this close to our trip. Read and understood

After that, two more images, one of a dog policy and a recap of house rules with a quick hit of the instructions for checkout. Read/understood.

We stay in the place and, as advertised, it is not updated. 90s construction with some DIY/Landlord grade repairs. But there are things that move this from ""dated"" to ""dilapidated"". Rugs are nailed down to a carpeted floor in a couple places in the living room, and have been re-nailed with previous nails still embedded into the carpet. Cutting boards are screwed down to the counters, making them impossible to clean. Some of the cutting boards have felt pads (typically used on furniture feet to prevent scratching hardwood floors) covering the screws presumably to prevent damage to knives, so that's gross and unsanitary. One of the couches has a broken sub-structure, so it sags as you sit on it. There's an old couch that has been out in the rain on the deck showing signs of mold/mildew. Speaking of the deck, I think a good kick to one of the posts could send it down, the metal brackets for the deck posts have corroded to the point of being dust, or thin enough to flake. A connected lower deck, admittedly better build, has a hot tub on it. Stairs from upper to lower deck have inconsistent steps, violating building code. The hot tub sits at the edge of the deck with UV degraded, and broken plastic lattice providing a bit of privacy, but would no doubt fail if even a child leaned against it, sending them 8' down to the ground. Two of the advertised 5 bedrooms exist in an un-permitted garage conversion (a permit was pulled, but never completed and subsequently expired). One of the beds in one of the un-permitted bedrooms had a broken box-spring, which we didn't use. There is some mold in the shower and on windows

All of these things we accepted. We're easy going travelers, and have no interest in having our vacation disrupted by bringing these issues up, and having the host/owner come to handle any of it. We enjoyed our stay well enough, but nobody in the group was sad to checkout of the place, and we will not be coming back.

After stay, I get the VRBO email request to review. Which I do. I give a 3/5 rating, and start to write about the things above. While writing the review, I began to have the feeling of ""If you can't say anything nice, don't say it."" Listing out the issues that I had with the place was making it difficult to not downgrade my 3/5 rating. So I removed the text, and simply submitted the rating.

Fast-forward almost 4 months, and I get a few messages from the owner asking to respond to him. Since I've got no business with him, I don't respond. One day passes and he hits me up with a message asking for clarification of the ""negative review"" that I left. I'm out doing something else, don't respond. 2.5 hours later, I get a longer text message explaining how the owner has had cancellations as a direct result of my review, and because I didn't follow the ""policy"" of contacting the owner directly, quote, ""...litigation through the courts is a necessity because we may get more cancellations as a direct result...""

I respond to him at this point. 4 months since the stay, I don't even remember what my review was. I pull up the site to check it out, and I can't see it because the host had deactivated their listing. I ask the host to provide me my review, since I don't recall what I had put in it. In the next message, host says listing is deactivated due to the poor review. If I'd be willing to remove it, he'll be ok with the revenue lost as ""a direct result"" of the bad review and won't pursue things further. Here we enter into a violation of VRBOs extortion policy:

""Our [Content Guidelines](https://www.vrbo.com/lp/b/content-guidelines) expressly prohibit extorting owners/managers or guests for money or any other consideration. 

* Guests can't threaten to use a review against you to obtain refunds or additional compensation. 
* Owners/managers can’t mandate a review in exchange for refunds, or ask the guest to revise a review for compensation. ""

Host forwards me the review later the next day. 3/5 rating, not text review. This jogs my memory to what I had put up a few paragraphs back. But I don't respond that day. Another day passes and he bugs me about it again. I respond requesting that he communicate with me through VRBO's platform, which he does. In the message on VRBO he doesn't explicitly say that he will pursue litigation unless the review is dropped, but does say ""...delete that review so then I well \[sic\] not pursue this any further."" 

Good enough for me. I contact VRBO support, tell them what all is going on with a host harassing me to remove a review (which I don't even think is possible on the VRBO platform) or face litigation. VRBO support is sympathetic, issues a case number on it, and says they will contact the host to discuss. 

The next day (yesterday), I get another few images of printed documents that are small claim court filings, that haven't yet been filed. Form states the case is due to ""Rental Policy violation"". Forms claim a $500 retroactive deposit (remember that bit about reserving the right to claim a deposit if policies are not followed?) and $2665 in lost revenue based on cancellations (no proof presented). Host says the will no be using VRBO anymore (not sure if that means that they won't/can't list their properties on VRBO, won't communicate through the VRBO platform, or both). Not sure at this point if VRBO has contacted the host or not, but I suspect they have. I will be following up with them today. 

I've captured images of all messages that have occurred between me and the host since first direct interaction in April. No interaction has occurred via phone or email, just text messages and VRBO inbox.

So that leads me to ask for some insight from reddit here.  

* First, my understanding is that if booking/paying through VRBO, all rental agreements are presented before booking. This comes from VRBO's trust page (https://www.vrbo.com/trust/owner-manager). Does that track with other's understandings? 
* Second, as stated before, there were issues with the place, but nothing that we needed or wanted the owner to take care of while we were there. Owners secondary documents asked me to contact if we had a need or problem. We had no needs or problems, we just stayed at a place that we won't come back to. Even if the secondary document does hold up to legal scrutiny, I feel like I didn't violate the policy, as I needed nothing from the owner. Thoughts? 

My next steps are to contact a local lawyer to provide some guidance, and contact VRBO again to bring up this recent escalation, and gain clarity from VRBO on the rental policy that was agreed to on booking back in February. Any other steps folks would suggest? ",13,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1f8xvkz/vrbo_host_threatening_small_claims_litigation/,2024-09-04 16:35:34,Booking.com
Vrbo,Learned how VRBO works from reading your posts - THANK YOU!,"I just wanted to express my gratitude for everyone posting in this group. 

  
Lessons Learned:

* If the host wants to cancel, don't let the host talk you into cancelling (even if there is no penalty for you). The host gets hit with a cancellation fee if they initiate the cancellation - [https://help.vrbo.com/articles/Partner-Cancellation-Fee-Policy](https://help.vrbo.com/articles/Partner-Cancellation-Fee-Policy)
* Once you agree to any changes outside of VRBO, what little protection you get from VRBO is null and void. Scam hosts will bait and switch your location and you will be SOL. 
* Communicate via the VRBO platform. Hosts are measured on how fast they respond to each message.

This week, I received an email (direct email, not a message through the VRBO platform) from Grand Welcome management company that my VRBO was ""no longer available"" with links to Grand Welcome's website of comparable properties at 50% higher rates.

I can completely understand the joys of capitalism; they booked my VRBO at a rate that was too low and now they need to cancel. But that's not my problem. I made this reservation over a month ago. 

I immediately messaged through the VRBO platform to say, ""Hey I just got a direct email from email address. If my reservation cannot be fulfilled, please cancel through VRBO so that I can receive a full refund."" 

The host responded, ""We are coordinating your request to our management team and we'll revert back once we hear back from them."" - This response doesn't tell me anything, just a response to satisfy the VRBO metric. For every ""non-response"" I would write back asking a question, ""What do you mean by revert back?"" 

I guess they got tired of me messaging them and cancelled my reservation through VRBO.",130,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1etr4jf/learned_how_vrbo_works_from_reading_your_posts/,2024-08-16 15:03:15,Booking.com
Vrbo,New VRBO Entry Access Policy,"I just received an email from VRBO stating that Jan 1, 2025, they are implementing a new policy for guests to receive critical access information such as keypad codes at least 72 hours prior to check-in.

  
I provide this information 24 hours prior to check-in, or, if I have a same day turnover, the morning of. Not a single guest has ever complained. One week prior to check-in, I inform them of the timelines and expectations and so on.

I might be dropping VRBO if this is enforced. I don't have a remote keypad lock because it sucks up batteries way too fast with wifi so the code is changes when the cleaner is on-site.

*******
Update: it seems you can still send the code the morning of check-in as long as you told the incoming guest when they will receive it (and that you don't forget to send it).

Starting **January 1, 2025**:|

||
||
|• If a traveler informs us they have not received critical stay information at least 72 hours prior to arrival, Vrbo will open an investigation.|

||
||
|• If we’re unable to establish critical stay information has been sent as required, we may cancel the booking on the partner’s behalf, refund the traveler, and offer alternative stay options.|

Vrbo,Red flags on VRBO?,"So there are a few red flags with this VRBO listing that is getting confusing for me....

I'm new to using VRBO. I booked a home for a large party through VRBO and was planning on paying in 2 payments. There are no reviews on this listing, however the host is a ""Premier Host."" Then I received a message from the host saying that it was not possible to process my payment with my credit card for booking. They then sent me a ""lodgify"" link for payment. Because I was feeling sus, I searched the address online and found that it was a property that is on the market currently.

I first called the real estate agent on the listing. He verified that it is an active Airbnb listing and the name of the property manager is his client.

Then I called VRBO to try and 1) verify if this listing has had people book in the past and 2) if it was shady to get links to third party sites.

The agent told me that this is actually a legit way for property managers to receive payment because VRBO will take the booking fee but the rest may need to be done on their third party site. The property manager gave me his website information ([https://www.sunnysidegetaways.com/](https://www.sunnysidegetaways.com/)) and his personal phone number through VRBO messaging. But when I asked for a phone call, he asked to keep all messages on the secure VRBO messaging app.

So it seems like there are some red flags that have legitimate answers for them? But I'm still feeling iffy about the third party payment and not sure what to make of his website and not wanting to call me.

Vrbo,RIPOFF REPORT host lured me to VRBO and then stole my funds [UK],"Booked in London in mid July, high demand, high rates. Surprisingly, the guy is an AIRBNB Superhost and asked me to book through VRBO instead. Oops, big mistake, as I didn't realize VRBO was so host friendly. I should have known, he only has 1 stay on VRBO, but it was cheaper. I got nervous and cancelled.

Low and behold, he won't return my refund and told me to screw off on the chat. I have almost a hundred calls to VRBO, the host, my credit card company...VRBO won't back down, and that he as the host has the right to keep my refund if he chooses so. In the meantime, he's booked the same week through AirBnB so he is getting double revenue. I'm too embarrassed to tell my wife and kids!

Vrbo,"Beware of “Elevate Rental” properties, possible fraud","I booked a two bedroom apartment/suite in July for October through VRBO, so 3 months in advance.  The host was listed as a company called Elevate Rentals LLC.  You can check out their website at elevate rentals LLC.com - it seems legit but what do I know?

The day of my trip they suddenly send an email and say they had to change my accommodation to something “comparable” - of course by the time I received the alternate location detail it was too late to do anything, I was getting ready to board the plane.  So I head to the alt hotel and am told the booking they made was for the day before so they had to cancel it.  They were willing to “reinstate” it for a $1500 fee.  I tried repeatedly to contact the host, who had been responsive up until that point.  But then they just stopped communication entirely, surprise!  It was so late by that point and I had never been to NY before so I just agreed.  I was put in a crappy single room, nothing close to the 2 bedroom suite I had originally booked.  

There’s a lot more detail but currently the money I originally paid thru VRBO is of course long gone.  I put in a dispute claim to PayPal but I doubt it will go anywhere.  “Elevate” has ignored all my attempts to contact them and just sends out generic form emails saying they are busy.  On top of that I now have the full bill from the predatory hotel (Millenium Hotel Broadway fyi) that I stayed at whose management would not budge on charging me a punishment fee.  They had a bunch of excuses how they couldn’t blah blah blah but everyone knows they could do whatever they wanted if they weren’t such greedy bastards.  

So long story short I’m down over $6000 from a $1900 VRBO reservation.   I suppose I could try to work it out through VRBO but I doubt they would do anything.  Hard lesson to learn but I should have known better to trust my instincts when I saw there were no reviews on the property.

Vrbo,Extenuating Circumstances Policy - help?,"I had a weekend booked downtown Atlanta starting on Fri. Sept. 27, the same day Hurricane Helene went through Georgia. 


I understand that hurricanes are not covered events. No, I did not get travel insurance, but I figured flooding was covered through the Extenuating Circumstances Policy here:
https://help.vrbo.com/articles/About-Extenuating-Circumstances-Policy


Which VRBO can activate. It says:


""What's covered
Natural disasters and abnormal weather events: For example, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, landslides, tornados, flooding, wildfires, and other historically severe weather events. 
Note: Foreseeable weather disasters (such as hurricanes, cyclones, and extreme winter storms) may be covered if they cause or coincide with another covered event. For example, a hurricane that causes prolonged outages to public utilities to a vast majority of homes in a major region or city (cannot be outages to a few neighborhoods). ""


Given the amount of flooding and power outages in Atlanta, I figured this would be covered. There was no way for me to safely get to my booking.



So I reached out to VRBO to ask about it. This is how the conversation went. 

Representative: So, I would like to inform you to utilize extenuating circumstances policy you would need to purchase trip cancelation policy. 

Me: oh, that was unclear to me. Where would I find information that says that?

Representative: our insurance company CSA will help you in purchasing trip cancelation policy after purchasing this policy you will be able to claim your reservation amount in full.

I wish there was a policy which states the same I could show.

Me: So there is not a policy stating this?

Representative: unfortunately, it is not updated yet as it is a new policy.

Me: So at the time of my reservation, this was not a policy?

Representative: it is a new Hurricane policy. 




Is this something I should keep pushing, or am I SOL? I wanted to understand why I can't use the Extenuating Circumstances Policy in this case but I'm just left even more confused.",7,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1g0iy1f/extenuating_circumstances_policy_help/,2024-10-10 13:34:27,Booking.com

Vrbo,Problems with Evolve Vacation Rental - *they* canceled the reservation and won't issue a refund,"I have searched the sub and found other posts complaining about this company (links below). We booked a reservation through VRBO for a property owned by Evolve Vacation Rental. We got a text message from the owner a couple hours before the reservation was supposed to start (when we had literally just landed after flying across the country) that they needed to cancel the reservation due to ""an unforeseen issue"" at the property, but could offer us another property instead. We said no (decided to just stay in a hotel instead) and asked for a full refund, which they said they would issue. 

We gave them a few days, didn't see the refund on our card, then spent a nightmarish week in text/chat support with finger-pointing and going in circles between VRBO, Evolve, and the actual property owner regarding who was actually responsible for issuing the cancelation and the refund. Ultimately, despite everyone saying we would get a refund, we still had nothing nearly a month later and we were sick of dealing with chat/phone support, so I just filed a dispute with our credit card company. We just got the resolution back that the companies claim ""goods were described and received in good condition,"" which I assume is just their default automatic reply, but in this case is totally false because they canceled the reservation and we never set foot on the property.

Thankfully we saved all of the text message and email correspondence, which I am now uploading to our CC company as supporting documentation. But this whole experience is a giant PITA. I (apparently mistakenly) thought the whole point of booking through a company like VRBO was that they handle all the credit card stuff and customer service directly, but we have separate charges on our card from VRBO and Evolve so had to deal with separate disputes for each.

I'm hoping the CC dispute is resolved in our favor, debating whether to file a BBB complaint - any other experiences or suggestions for something like this?

Vrbo,Vrbo issues and hurricane debby!!! ,"So we had rented a house by Charleston sc, for Aug3-10. We arrive and the next day there’s hurricane debby on the news. I couldn’t reach the host or Vrbo!! I was trying to find out the procedure for such an event but couldn’t get ahold of anybody. 

I made the decision to leave to keep myself and daughter safe. Upon getting home I continued to try to reach the host/ Vrbo to no avails. 

I made the next decision to put a charge back order on my credit card to prevent me from incurring any fraudulent charges and sent an email to Vrbo explaining how I felt they were negligent in providing emergency information during a potentially fatal hurricane. 
The response I got is where I m confused and I’ll post below: could someone help me understand what they are saying and any advice about the charge back and where to go from here would be appreciated!

You will need to pay upfront and a reimbursement may be provided should it fulfill our Book with Confidence program. You may book new reservation up to $13,212.075 and we will reimburse you for the price difference between your cancelled reservation and new reservation up to $4,404.025. When you are denied entry or a host cancels your reservation, you are entitled to a full refund of that reservation, and we will be working to ensure this is provided if it has not already been initiated.

Vrbo,Is This VRBO Listing in South of France Legit? Looking for Advice!,"Hey everyone,

I'm fairly new to VRBO and I've come across a listing for a vacation home in the South of France that can host up to 13 people. It looks like the perfect spot for our group, but I want to make sure it's legit before booking. Since I'm not that familiar with the site and how everything works, I thought I'd ask for some advice from those with more experience!

Here are some details:

Location: South of France
Capacity: 13 people
Price: (seems reasonable, but almost too good to be true)
The photos look professional, but I can't really tell if it's an honest deal.
Questions:

How can I verify if this listing is legitimate and if the host is trustworthy?
What are some red flags I should be aware of to spot scams on VRBO?
Do you have any tools or methods you use to thoroughly vet a vacation home before booking?
Has anyone had experience with VRBO in the South of France, and are there any local issues I should be aware of?
How has your experience been with VRBO’s customer service in case there are problems with the booking?
I’d really appreciate any help from those who are more familiar with VRBO. Any tips or insights are welcome, as I’d like to avoid losing money to a potentially fraudulent listing. 😊

Thanks so much for your help!

Vrbo,Everyone is talking about entrance policy but not how broken and untested their platform is!,"You can’t reliable change a booking because when the host changes dates, it doesn’t always prompt you to charge the guest for the additional dates, it just changes the dates. This makes extending a booking a two step process.

When you receive a booking notification, there’s no link to the booking chat to engage the customer. You have to hunt for the booking to find the guest to engage them.

Mostly, the new policy Is bullshit because some hosts require ID before providing a door code. Guests will receive such notice and read it in the house rules, but just ignore it till the very last moment.

When you sent or receive an attachment from a guest, it stores that binary data in your attach history which becomes a mess because you can only delete those attachments one at a time.

Direct linking to your vrbo stay doesn’t actually let the guest book your unit. They put the dates in and get a list of other units that are not yours. If you’re lucky, when you scroll down, you may or may not find your listing which you can click on and get to put your dates in again. Don’t take my word for it, just try it. Does  that seem fair and correct?

You may get an account rep assigned to you, but they will never help you with anything that matters, they are just corporate puppets not there to help you.

So… VRBO, in all your German direkt glory. Please have your house in order before you start making rules that don’t matter and become prohibitively difficult to follow because of your broken ass platform and garbage development team that’s clearly got you by the balls.

My favorite is the non stop spam from people wanting to book my units with some company certified check. Really folks? This has been going on for years.. can you please stop trolls from passing phishing information using a pdf attachment in an inquiry? I mean, why does any inquiry need to also send attachments? Turn that shit the fuck off you morons!

Vrbo,"Bad review for 2770227 - ""Nice Apartment next to Christmas Story House"" - Cleveland, OH","I see I'm not alone.  This is a very problematic business model for renters, not being able to review cancelled bookings.  Since I cannot leave this legitimate review on Vrbo, I'll leave it here in the hopes it may help someone else from having the same experience.  

  

[https://www.vrbo.com/2770227](https://www.vrbo.com/2770227)

  

In February of 2023 my family booked this listing for the April 2024 eclipse.  At that time, I had several interactions with the owner about the property and process for checking in.  For the next fourteen months, there was no notification of any problems.  Two days before our check-in, the owner cancelled the booking.  It was obviously a cut-and-paste message to me, as the message literally stated, ""Dear \[Intended Receipient\]...""  I immediately reached out to the owner with a phone call, that went immediately to voicemail.  I replied by Vrbo messaging with no response.  I contacted Vrbo support and created a trouble ticket.  I called the owner again, and it went straight to voicemail.  I relayed the ticket number via Vrbo messaging, and in a few minutes, the owner updated the ticket with the reason for cancellation being ""Customer cancelled.""  Not only did the owner cancel my booking, made a year in advance, two days before check-in, but the owner lied about the reason for cancelling.  The owner did refund my money, but it took over a month to get the refund for the trip's insurance back.  My family and I salvaged our trip at a much greater expense for a last-minute booking somewhere else.  This experience has soured me on this industry, as it would seem owners can arbitrarily cancel reservations at their discretion.  Based on my experience, I highly recommend potential customers book somewhere else.",7,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1d3d4xk/bad_review_for_2770227_nice_apartment_next_to/,2024-05-29 14:09:47,Booking.com
Vrbo,Calls and emails after booking. Scam?,"Booked an international stay on 7/27. 

On 8/13 I received 3 calls from what the caller id said was Vrbo, after I googled it. No voicemail. 

8/14 I received an email ending with @expedia.com asking for more info about my case.

8/15 I got 2 emails. The first stating I contacted them regarding my cancellation. And then a survey about the experience. 

I messaged the person I booked with on the app and they said we were good to go. I called Vrbo and inquired if anyone was contacting them on my behalf as they clearly know I booked and have my name. Vrbo said my call today was the first. Just got the wheels turning in my head now.

Vrbo,Software to Publish Property Listings on Multiple Platforms Simultaneously,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for software solutions that can help me publish my property listings on multiple booking platforms (like Airbnb, [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), Expedia, etc.) all at once, rather than just syncing them.

I contacted VRBO and they said this was indeed not allowed. When I checked the new invoice vs the old one, they both said $300 a night and the only thing that was changed was 
'Host fees'. 
 
I told her that it didn't seem ethical to raise the price after I had booked, especially since she admitted it was her fault, and after she told me to cancel I said I wanted to keep it and she could take the $50 charge up with VRBO. 

Unsure how to proceed bc I need to look for a diff place if this is gonna go south but realistically is it allowed to raise price after o book? It's only $50 but it's the principle. ",5,3,https://i.redd.it/oq1iqjlwul1d1.jpeg,2024-05-20 16:07:27,Booking.com

Vrbo,Anyone else get weird requests to “verify payment” through stripe? And then have reservation cancelled?,"Booked a spot in Paris for my family of three. It said I was confirmed but the. I got this strangely worded email asking me to “kindly” (isn’t that word always a red flag?) click on a link to Stripe to “verify” my payment. First of all doesnt VRBO stand for “Vacation Rental BY OWNER?” That email (pictured) is not from an owner lol. GuestReady is some big corporate property manager. But also why do you need to verify anything? Isn’t that why I’m using something like VRBO in the first place?

Regardless I tried to research a bit, went back to the link and it had expired. I emailed a live agent at VRBO who strenuously assured me this was a “trusted third party” who just “uses different softwares (sic)”. They said the owner would send me a new link. 

Instead, less than two hours later, the booking got cancelled because I hadn’t “verified”.

Vrbo,"Follow-up Question to ""Deceptive Listing and we got Skr*wed""","This is a follow-up, original post here [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/17vhdif/deceptive_listing_and_we_got_screed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  Your comments and ideas on the original post were really helpful, and gave us so much confidence in letting AMEX handle it.  So here is a second question!

Follow up to the situation in which we mistakenly booked a place on Vrbo not realizing there were MASSIVE fees for each additional person over 1 – which put the cost from $499 per night up to more than $2500 per night. We immediately sent note after booking when we saw cost so high, but no response from owner. It required us to contact Vrbo to get them to respond. They have a no-refund policy and have essentially not even been willing to engage in any conversation. We have opened a dispute with our credit card company. Other aspects of this lead us to possibly even think that this is some kind of scam and the actual owner of the property is unaware of all this.

We found the owner’s name and some contact phone numbers by searching the county appraisal records (its impossible on the Vrbo website to find out this information, and the contact person does not answer the phone number provided by Vrbo).

So our question for the Reddit community is: Should we try to contact the owner?

We think there are three possibilities:

1. The owner hired a management company who is the one being intransigent and deceitful – in this case a call to the owner might cause them to have a heart and authorize a refund, and also admonish the management company not to be so deceitful for a new Vrbo property
2. It’s a scam and the owner is unaware that the place is even listed for rent – in which case the owner would of course want to know, and this would also of course instantly resolve the dispute with the credit card company in our favor
3. The owner is actually the one being intransigent and deceitful, in which case a call from us might prompt them to ramp up efforts to defend the charge with the credit card company and so could possibly reduce the probability of it being resolved in our favor

So we throw it out to the crowd: should we try to call the owner, and if so are there any suggestions on how to handle it.

Thank you kind strangers!

&#x200B;

Final update:  We believe that AMEX came through and approved the dispute (e.g. refunded our money), most likely because they could not get in contact with the host.

Vrbo,Help me understand why scammers are doing this,"Remember hackers hacked into my account and cancelled my confirmed reservation one by one.

The phone number is the hacker’s phone. Is he trying to encourage guest to call him by cancelling my reservation and routed the piece meal refunds to guests? Why did the scammer do this way? Why did scammer cancel my reservation and refund guests? And why did scammer invite all inquiry to book at $20 /per night rate? He can’t get paid until check in, right?

Vrbo,onekeycash and VRBO,"Question for hosts, or anyone really.

I have a good amount of onekeycash accumulated from years of being a gold member with [hotels.com](https://hotels.com). The time has finally come where I'm trying to use it towards a rental on VRBO only to see that almost no rentals accept it. 

I understand, or think, this is at the discretion of the property host. Is there any reason why hosts wouldn't accept onekeycash? Wouldn't it still be the same actual cash in their pocket? 

Secondly do hosts ever 'flip the switch' and accept it if they are asked prior to booking?

Vrbo,I thought Airbnb was bad. Then I booked with VRBO.,"I have had my share of not-so-great experiences with Airbnb but in the end, they always came through, although you have to spend hours on phone with them.

VRBO seems 1000 times worse than Airbnb. We booked a vacation rental in Hawaii using VRBO and were eagerly looking forward to it. Once we checked in the house was in a horrible condition. It looked as if it was not cleaned between guests. There were roaches in dishwasher, hair on the floor, unflushed toilet paper, food particles all over the countertop, unclean/used towels. We immediately alerted the host and VRBO. We sent 30+ photos and videos of roach sightings. I was communicating with the host via VRBO chat so I can have record of everything. The host agreed that their regular cleaners were out of town and she doesn't know if the temp cleaners did the cleaning or not. The host said that she can't schedule the cleaners until the next one or two days. We refused with that resolution as we didn't want to stay in a dirty house.

VRBO said that they would provide alternative accommodation until the house gets cleaned. The host agreed to change the reservation to start on the next day so we don't be charged for that one night we can't stay. We left the keys inside the home and left the house waiting for VRBO to send us alternative accommodation details. We waited for couple of hours and had to call back as it was almost close to 10 PM. Keep in mind that we left the keys inside the house and at this point we don't have the keys to the vacation home anymore.

We called VRBO again to see what happened to our alternative accommodation. The new agent we spoke to says that what was told to me was not the standard procedure. They said that the VRBO has to confirm with the host regarding the 1-night refund. We told the agent that the host agreed to it on the chat and the previous agent told us they will find us alternative accommodation. The new agent refused to do anything as she was trying to contact the host to get 1 night cancellation confirmation. It was past midnight where the host lives so the host didn't respond. By this time, it was almost midnight where we were. The agent kept telling me that we can't get alternate accommodation. We informed the agent that we don't even have the keys to get it. At this point the agent said that VRBO can't provide alternative accommodation but can reimburse us for up to $150 and that we have to make our own booking. We were in Hawaii and there was absolutely nothing available for under $1000 a night. I don't understand how VRBO can leave their customers stranded in the middle of the night.

It is ridiculous that they offered $150 in the first place. What makes it worse that it came with so many conditions that it is impossible to get that $150. The requirements were that I need to book with Expedia or [Hotels.com](https://hotels.com/) or directly with the hotel. If I found accommodation on any other 3rd party website or any of the credit card portals, then they wouldn't reimburse $150.

It is beyond my comprehension how VRBO is still in business. We ended up cancelling the accommodation as the host couldn't promise the house would be cleaned in a timely manner as their regular cleaners were out of town. VRBO refused to help as they said that the host agreed to clean the house ""at some point"" during our stay. VRBO also said that they require proof of multiple roach sightings to consider the home unsanitary. I was only able to send 6 different roach sighting videos as every time I open a cabinet door or dishwasher, roaches run so fast that it's impossible to catch them on video. Apparently 6 sightings is not enough proof. Since the listing was cancelled, I can't even write a review.

I got all of my money back as the host agreed to cancel but we lost almost 1 whole day in our 10-day vacation and also had to spend \~5x the original amount to find last minute accommodation. I know there is nothing I can do now but just wanted to rant somewhere.",11,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/14z59sa/i_thought_airbnb_was_bad_then_i_booked_with_vrbo/,2023-07-14 03:37:52,Booking.com
Vrbo,How to detect a VRBO scam?,"I am looking to rent a home on VRBO...I have been doing research on scams and wondering how to detect a scam?

Vrbo,VRBO your software is a broken dumpster fire mess,"I go to add a day to the guests booking, would have added about $250. Instead (after getting an error after the first attempt) I click again and get a message to refund them $4000 something. What?

The real problem here is that I can’t alter dates of bookings without first manually sending a money request that I have to manually calculate. While we wait for the guest to press the pay button, anyone can book that day because your date altering code is granting refunds when you extend the booking. It’s been like this for years and the bug list goes on. Your software engineers suck. They have no idea what they are doing. So much of this is untested and a mess. I don’t see how this is even used nor trusted by people. Someone will come and eat your lunch.",11,10,https://i.redd.it/udfpu6xccyab1.jpg,2023-07-09 14:46:16,Booking.com

Vrbo,"Trip in 2 Days, No Response from Host","Hello,

I posted a few days ago about this situation. The thread is here if you care to read it: https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/uem36w/no_response_from_host_vacation_in_6_days/

Nothing has changed, except my trip is in 2 days, and I'm still hitting a wall with the host. I was supposed to get access instructions today, and nothing. I sent host another message through the app, and no reply. I also tried texting her phone, same thing. I called Vrbo customer service, and they said they'd send her an email. 

At this point, however, I'm wondering about Vrbos refund policy. The way I understand is you have to literally arrive at the property, have no access, and then and ONLY then will they refund you in full. Is this correct? And if so, how does this make sense for people who drive hundreds of miles just to have no place to stay, and ultimately, a ruined vacation? 

I honestly don't know what to do. Perhaps I'm overreacting, but I've never booked through Vrbo before, and at least some acknowledgement from the host would put me at ease. I can't even get excited about vacation because I'm too worried I lost $800 and will have no place to stay. 

Any advice in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.",6,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/uh2plc/trip_in_2_days_no_response_from_host/,2022-05-02 23:28:54,Booking.com
Vrbo,Finally a resolution: long process with VRBO support & host scammer,"I hope this is helpful for anyone that attempts to deal with Vrbo support.  

As a brief summary, after making my first booking through Vrbo, the host unexpectedly cancelled two weeks before the stay.  He would not issue a refund, and Vrbo support would not rebook me.  The original thread contains additional details:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/zyksxj/host\_scam\_vrbo\_does\_not\_protect\_against\_blatant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/zyksxj/host_scam_vrbo_does_not_protect_against_blatant/).  

While I am frustrated that Vrbo lists & facilitates transactions with scammers, my experience with their customer support was even worse.  I spent four months trying to resolve blatant fraud with customer support, repeatedly being told a full refund was due and in process.  Yet it was never issued.  A few of the agents tried to explain that Vrbo 'has been unable to reach the host (scammer).'  Surprise, surprise.  

The agents are outsourced and have no authority.  I probably interacted with 15-20 different agents (some online disconnected immediately after I provided a Vrbo case #), and was told many times that Vrbo would follow up with me.  No one did.  

As a last resort, I called the credit card company and disputed the charge/initiated a chargeback.   Never had any VRBO agents suggested this, instead telling me to have patience.   American Express was terrific; within 24hr, they had followed up with me multiple times to ensure they had all the needed documentation, and within 2-4 days had issued a refund (pending a response from the host).   

Ironically, within days of initiating the dispute, VRBO finally followed up with me.  Their process for refunds and policing the transactions on their site?  You are on your own, and must dispute being scammed on their site with your own bank/credit card provider, even though none of their outsoruced agents apparently know or will admit this.  See below for their message.

Vrbo,Subject: Seeking Advice on VRBO.com as an Additional Platform," 

Hello everyone,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out to this community as I've been a long-time user of Airbnb for my vacation rental, but I'm now considering expanding my presence to include another platform alongside Airbnb. Currently, I receive most of my bookings through Airbnb and my personal website, The Bee Cottage ([**https://thebeecottage.co.uk/**](https://thebeecottage.co.uk/)).

In my quest to explore additional options, I came across VRBO.com and noticed that some properties in my area are listed there. However, during my online research, I noticed that many of these listings had relatively few reviews, which raised some concerns about the effectiveness of VRBO.com for my specific location.

I'm curious to know if VRBO.com is worth considering as an additional platform. From what I understand, VRBO.com operates on a guest-paid model, where the 10% fee accumulates towards the annual subscription fee. However, I'm uncertain about what happens if the guest fails to pay these additional fees. Will I be responsible for covering the outstanding amount, which I estimate to be around $500 or thereabouts?

I would greatly appreciate it if any of you could share your experiences and insights regarding VRBO.com. I'm particularly interested in understanding how the platform works and whether it has been beneficial for your vacation rental business.

Please accept my apologies for any inaccuracies in my calculations or understanding of VRBO.com. I'm still in the process of learning about this platform, and your input would be immensely valuable.

Thank you all in advance for your time and any advice you can provide.

Best regards,

Vrbo,Just confirming that this was a scam?,"My relatives have booked through VRBO before with no issues and prices seemed better than kayak, trivago etc. I found a room with an admittedly shockingly low price for the quality of the room in a high demand location. The ""host"" was ""\[Location\] Vacation Properties"". They had a transient lodging license listed and good reviews, so I thought it was a little weird but legit. 

We booked six days for 2300 and paid a deposit of around 250. Shortly afterward, I get a text and an email from Location Vacation Properties. The text just said to check my email.

The email said:

*""To secure your booking, please use the link below to make your payment securely using Vacation Rent Payment. Please note: You booked through HomeAway or VRBO's site. The payment you made on that site, was for a HomeAway Service Fee only. This payment request is for the booking itself. You can double check your HomeAway account. Thank you.""*

With another charge for four hundred something bucks and a ""secure payment portal"" button.

My scam alert went off so I cancelled the booking, marked that I had encountered suspicious activity, and noted that I was not comfortable paying outside of VRBO.

The host's response....

 *""We totally understand. This is VRBO's policy and way they do business. We are \[Location\] Vacation Properties, and VRBO/**Homeaway* *.com* *sends you to the property management company to secure reservations and collect payment, after you pay them their fees. We were te ones who sent your Payment Request, they are sent via E-Mail with a secure payment link. We will go ahead and Cancel this booking. However, this is what you can expect when booking your trip through VRBO/Homeaway. Best Regards,""*

As well as a second response under a man's name, not Location Vacation Properties...

*""Basically...VRBO charges their fees, ($xxxx). VRBO/Homeaway then sends you to the property management company to secure reservations and collect payment after they take their fees.""* 

Here's the thing. We also booked a weeklong vacation in a much less high-demand location in another state, and got no such request from that host. I also asked my relative and they did not have to do any kind of secondary payment through some portal either. Their trip was ""in the middle"" in terms of how high-demand their vacation spot was. 

Was this a scam or did I just cancel a good deal? Red flags fly up when I'm asked to make any sort of secondary payments on something, particularly some random portal. At the very least, wouldn't it have nullified any terms and conditions through VRBO? Why would they allow the money to be collected at some secondary website - do they not take a bit off the top on payments?

Vrbo,Question for VRBO Hosts - Best way to delete & re-list VRBO listing?,"Question for the VRBO host experts out there:

What's the best/cleanest way to get a fresh start on a relatively new VRBO listing that hasn't gotten any traction? As background, we have a good listing but it seems to be at the bottom of VRBO search for a couple months, and we've gotten zero bookings and reviews. Meanwhile have been doing well on Airbnb with 15 reviews and getting superhost status in the same time.

We're going to at least delete the VRBO listing and start a new one. But should we also delete the VRBO host account and start a new one (even with the same email address) for a pure fresh start? There are no reviews tied to the host profile, so don't feel like we're losing anything. But not sure if there are any drawbacks to a new host profile or if it will be flagged. Our goal is to get premier status by the next assessment period or two.

Relatedly, in 2021 VRBO announced a ""Fast Start Program"" for new hosts: [https://www.vrbo.com/.../vrbo-launches-fast-start-program...](https://www.vrbo.com/media-center/press-releases/2021/vrbo-launches-fast-start-program-to-fuel-early-success-of-new-hosts?fbclid=IwAR1vTndQDEOY5CEGe1V7TPk5T4isX5IdqnwFQs6PcRiBrdGYu6rZnBHruoY)

Vrbo,VRBO has no real property insurance policy apparently?,"I have been an AirBnB host for 6 years now off and on at a few different properties and hosted maybe 300 guests. On maybe 5% of stays, a guest has caused damages within my damage deposit and I dock the deposit accordingly. On <1% of stays, there is substantial damage above and beyond what a credit card hold would cover (e.g. two 20 something boys used my place for a wild frat party lasting three days). AirBnB has a $3M insurance policy for instances like this, [https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/279](https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/279), that I have used a couple times without major issues.

A year ago, I listed a couple properties on VRBO, in addition to AirBnB, and I have had to dock the damage deposit maybe 3-5 times. For the first time last month, I had a guest do more damage than the deposit (they brought a dog into my unit and picked up its poop with paper towels and flushed the whole result down my toilets for a month backing up 100 feet of plumbing and causing septic tank issues). I called VRBO and they gave me the contact info for their insurance provider, Generali. I contacted Generali and they said;

1. The guest did not spend either the $59 or $99 to purchase insurance so I cannot collect anything.
2. Even if they DID purchase insurance, it would be $1500 or $2500 payout MAX.

Sooo, if I have a psycho book one of my units, he burns the place down, VRBO apparently will reimburse me $0 unless he purchased insurance and only $1500 to $2500 if the lunatic did. Why in the hell would I keep my properties on VRBO instead of just AirBnB if VRBO is basically completely uninsured. I get to fill some of my AirBnB vacancy but run the risk of $500k in property damage....bad deal.

Adding insult to injury, apparently when the host cancels a stay early, even because the guest violated house rules, VRBO releases the damages deposit automatically. I tried to dock all $500 of my deposit for the above guest in the platform, did not work. I called, spoke with a front-line and a manager, both said that I cannot dock the deposit because the stay was cancelled.

So obviously I'm drafting a small claims case against VRBO atm for my septic damage, but do any other owners know if the above info is correct and basically VRBO has no insurance for major damage caused by guests?

Vrbo,VRBO Booking Scam - be Aware!,"I received a message in-app which said they wanted to speak with me about their booking. I have had this happen once before, with no issue.

This time it ended up being someone who was phishing for my login info. They said that they had booked, and forwarded a link which looks like it goes to VRBO.

Right now I'm trolling them and saying that I got their booking, but need their cc info. :)

But be very careful about interacting off-app!

Vrbo,I hate hate hate my VRBO experience (and it is still going),"I feel like i am exhausted even typing this out for how many ""support"" people i've ""talked"" to in the past few weeks, but here we are.  If i can help anyone with my situation be a better host it will all be...nevermind, nothing will be worth it.  Here is my timeline:

\- There is a music festival in Barcelona on the beach called Primavera Sound.  It is an incredible festival over a weekend (this year they extended it to two full weeks).  So i've been twice and know that in order to enjoy it with my kids (15 and 17 yr old girls) i need to have a place close to the venue.  I don't want to get a taxi at 4:00 am with my tired kids, etc.  In the past i've booked a hotel and loved it.  Last year (a full YEAR before the festival) i booked a place for my whole family (6 of us) through hotels . com, not realizing it was a VRBO property.

\- Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago and i'm wanting to pay the other 2/3rds of my reservation.  I messaged the owner and nothing...tried again and nothing.  Strange because I wanted to pay them money so no idea why they wouldn't get right on that.

\- Finally i get tired of messaging through the site (5 times at this point) and noticed buried in the listing a cell number.  so i text that and don't hear back for a couple days.  I try again and someone replies that the owner had a heart attack and they work with him and would talk with them and get back to me.  I wait another few days and try again.  Again they said that they haven't had a chance to talk with them, but they would soon and ask me the information.  I again give it and don't hear back.

\- I get tired of it (and worried at this point) and call VRBO support.  I am really worried because i booked a year ago so i wouldn't have a place right next to the festival and if this place isn't available i'm screwed.  Well the person ""helping"" me put me on hold after telling them the whole thing and next thing i know i'm talking to the person that was the host's co-worker and they are mad that i didn't believe them that they were working on it.  He said, ""I told you I would help you, why did you call support???""  He says he is finding me information and would call me back the next day.  I explain it is VERY important i don't lose this place and explain why.  At that point he is very nice and says he will take care of us, don't worry, etc.

\- Next day i get a text from him, ""call me ASAP"".  So i have my wife on the phone with me because she's fluent in Spanish and I need him to understand why i need that place or one right by it.  She speaks to him for 10 minutes and then hangs up and says, and I quote, ""that guy is full of shit.  We need to cancel right away and get our money back and hopefully find a place, but it is probably too late.""  

\-So she proceeds to tell me that he was trying to talk her into having a place near and we could take a taxi, etc. and she said, ""we don't want another place, we want that one"" and he finally admits that he rented the place out long term because of COVID and we should be understanding because, after all, it is COVID, etc. etc. etc.  I'm livid at this point because if they rented it out last year long term WHY THE HELL DIDN'T THEY TELL ME???  It seemed like he felt he could just bait and switch and everything would be ok, but when she said it was for Primavera Sound and there were 6 of us his tone totally changed to one of concern.  Ohhhhhhh.  Really?  Ohhhh...  Well, taxi will be fine, etc.  Man i was livid.

\- So i call VRBO and this is where i feel like the company could give a shit about me or anyone that they work with, preferring to push it off on the host.  I explained all of this and the person helping me hung up on me.   It took me a long time to explain it, so i was pissed.  I ALWAYS try to make sure the person on the phone doesn't feel like i'm upset at them, and i'll tell them that, but getting hung up on isn't cool.  So i call back and explain to the next person what happened and they said, ""sorry, but you need to talk to a different department"" and then they transferred me to, yep, the host.  So i hang up again and call back and ask right off to talk to a manager, etc.  That is when this agent says i need to explain what the deal is before she can give me a manager and after I do she says, ""so what do you want us to do?"" and I tell her she needs to help me pay for a hotel that is the only one left next to the venue.  It would normally be $200 a night but because of Primavera it is $1,000 a night and because the host didn't tell me soon enough I am stuck with that bill.  She said there is no way because it isn't their fault, only the host, so they can't do anything and a manager would tell me the same thing.  I told her i've tried to talk to VRBO before when things weren't as bad and they kept pushing me at the host, but she didn't care.   She ""talked"" to her manager and came back and said they can't do anything.

\- Last bits: i told her to cancel the reservation and she did, but it still says (a week later) that the host has to cancel.  I have texted the host, but they aren't cancelling.  They are pushing me at the host for everything but the host is a liar and crook.  Oh, and i called Hotels . com because they were who i did it originally through just to vent.  They have zero ownership of all of this, but they gave me $100 in credit because they felt bad.  Unreal.

Sorry, that was long.  Don't know if it will get published, but I had to tell someone sort of close to VRBO because nobody there seems to really care.",7,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/u6nih7/i_hate_hate_hate_my_vrbo_experience_and_it_is/,2022-04-18 21:03:48,Booking.com

Vrbo,First renting a vacation home,"I made a late reservation so the place i was looking at only has couple homes to rent. I came upon this house and the owner has it listed everywhere (booking.com, vrbo, airbnb etc). I found vrbo to be cheapest (about $100 a night) so I made the reservation there. It said it’ll take 24hrs for owner to confirm. Owner messaged and asked me to call him. I spoke to him briefly and asked him how come he posted multiple places with different prices as well there is no review on his rental place at any those places that he listed. He gave me some excuses. I wasn’t paying much attention. Anyhow, it seems kinda sketchy to me. The rental place is about 2.5hrs drive from where I live. I don’t want my family to get stranded. Also first time I had to talk to an owner to make a reservation. Is this a new thing. The place costs about $800 a night. With cleaning and service fee and taxes, it comes about $2200 for 2-nights. It is a nice place on the water and close to the beach. Anyway, this is only place left with the date I want. Not sure confidently to move forward.

Vrbo,Strange message from host concerning distant future reservation.,"I received a strange message from the host of a property at a prime location for a festival in Mar 2022. She mentioned that she did not realize the calendar let me book this far in advance and that they only “work with” reservations that are two months from the date. 

She mentioned I could cancel now and get a full refund, but I’d rather just keep the reservation. There’s a chance the festival of course won’t happen due to COVID but it’s a nice resort and I’d honestly just use the reservation anyway. Additionally, I believe the place I’m staying is technically a hotel and the host is operating under an LLC.

Does this mean my reservation isn’t valid? I have sent a message to ask this but haven’t heard back. She has not cancelled the reservation so I’m a little confused. Any insight from property managers here would be appreciated!

Edit: Should note the VRBO page says amount is non-refundable but in the message she says she will refund in full if I cancel. I’m concerned I could be left holding the bag given the screenshot I saw in an [earlier post here](https://reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/ly8jx4/vrbo_does_not_protect_customers_do_not_use_this/).

She has responded to my question of whether I should cancel: 
“Hi BellaTriumph,

Yes, we only open our calendar for stays within the next 2 months and this was a glitch that had March 2022 wide open. We can still try to get you the reservation but it's not something we would be able to get until next January.”",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/ml2qgg/strange_message_from_host_concerning_distant/,2021-04-06 03:43:52,Booking.com

The host misrepresented the property. The entire building reeked of smoke, and there were drug users and homeless people IN the hallways of my rented apartment. The host was largely unresponsive, and was of no help. Neither was Vrbo customer support. In fact, it is the WORST I have ever seen in my life. 

They put you on hold for what seems to be FOREVER, keep transferring you to other departments, the line will often drop, and they do not have a good record keeping system, so you have explain yourself OVER AND OVER AGAIN. They do not appear to be based in the US/Canada and all sound robotic as if they are reading from a script.
They stated that a refund was at the discretion of the host, and they couldn't do ANYTHING to make things right. Essentially no protection for the guest WHATSOEVER.
Anyone can simply make a listing, post devious pictures and misrepresent the fact, and we're basically at their mercy. You can send pictures, videos and testimony to no avail. I've now lost over $600 to this misadventure. NEVER AGAIN.

Vrbo,"Before you book a VRBO vacation, please read this!","# You can lose your money if you have not done your homework.

\-**VRBO won't give money back** or help you if you are stuck in a dirty place; most VRBO owners have one or two properties and are not paying for your stay elsewhere.

\-**Calling VRBO will not help**; they take notes but do not act. Supervisors or managers are useless; opening tickets are useless. Most customer representatives need to learn about their business model, and they would argue with you. Every promise to follow up and call you back is BS.

**Before booking the property**

\- look for some of your friends who stayed at the property, and you know 100% is a safe and clean place

\- don't rely on the reviews; those could be misleading and false. The host knows how to sweeten guests into writing a nice false review.

\- **if you don't know anything about the property, don't pay.** There is a chance (i argue that there is a 50/50 chance, based on BBB/Twitter complaints) you will lose your money and have to find another place on the spot,  paying double.

\- pictures may be misleading and old even if the property says ""remodeled"", or ""upgraded"";

Is there any way for me to protect myself from this? Do they tell you all the fees in advance or do they tack on more upon arrival etc? I shoulda booked this days ago and I keep putting it off cuz I don't fully trust this process. Especially since none of these places offer full refunds. Any insights or recommendations?

The rep from VRBO said there is a listing for my address but they were unable to tell me the name of the person who listed my address, nor tell me what form of verification this person used to list my apartment. I was told to send VRBO pictures to see if they match the photos on the listing (not sure how or why this matters because it's a fake listing) and that they would ""elevate my case to the team."" I'm waiting for them to contact me again and help resolve this issue but I'm just so confused how this could have happened. I'm aware that there is plenty of scams out there but this seems like it should not happen AND should be easily be taken down by me reporting it, however it seems I'm going to have to fight to get this fake listing taken down. 

  
Has this ever happened to anyone else? What do I need to do to get VRBO to remove my address? How did this even get allowed in the first place? It's an extreme safety concern and invasion of privacy to have people showing up at my door expecting to stay here. Luckily, the person today was very rational and understood that they were likely scammed, but if the wrong person shows up and is convinced they have a right to stay in my apartment....that could be extremely ugly.

Vrbo,"Host says property is not available and tells me to cancel, Vrbo won't let me cancel","I booked a Vrbo property for tomorrow, rental fee plus a hefty $3000 damage deposit.

Today I get a call from the host that the property has ""been destroyed"" and that I should cancel. I asked him to call Vrbo and cancel.

He called me back that he called Vrbo and Vrbo said that I should cancel.

But the cancel button on the Vrbo website is grayed out. When I clicked on the Vrbo live chat, I got a guy who couldn't really write proper English telling me that it is not possible for him to cancel, and that only the host can cancel, that Vrbo is only a third party (then why is it Vrbo that charged my credit card?)

The host says he is ""dealing with a lot of stuff"" and won't be able to do anything tonight.

Vrbo,Help!  Our Vrbo was abandoned and we are stranded!,"UPDATE: Just wanted to let anyone who read my earlier post how things turned out.  We found a lovely Airbnb Friday night on very short notice.  The host was very helpful and welcoming.  As many of you said, VRBO never did call us back.  

Thank you for everyone’s well wishes and suggestions.  I truly didn’t know that VRBO had such a terrible reputation.  We have only ever had positive experiences.

We will be pursuing some type of action when we get home but not sure what, yet.  I’m still shocked that they would just flat out lie to us repeatedly about trying to help us.



We are in a bit of a situation and don’t know what to do.  Any advice you have would be appreciated.  I booked a Vrbo back in October for a very highly rated and popular cottage on Vancouver Island.  When we arrived, it was filthy, it was obvious nobody had prepared for our arrival.  The main house on the property also appeared abandoned.  We tried to contact the owner but their number was not in service.  We spoke to the neighbours and they said the owners had left.

I contacted Vrbo that evening (July 31).  The rep advised me to book our own accommodation for 2 nights and they would reimburse us up to a specific amount.  It was not easy to find a place but we were fortunate to find one rental left.  The Vrbo rep said that the relocation team would be in touch the next day to give us options on a different Vrbo for the remaining 3 days of our trip.  

I called Vrbo twice yesterday and was told they were working on finding us a new place to stay.  The reps said they had escalated the matter and to be patient.  They reassured me someone would be in touch ASAP.  

This morning I used the chat function to speak to another rep.  She said she would mark the matter as urgent (I assumed this was urgent from day 1) and said we should hear back within an hour.  2 hours passed so I called again, as we had still not heard back from the relocation team.   She apologized for our experience.  I asked if there was a supervisor I could speak to and she said she would try but that the queue was quite long.  I told her I was fine waiting as we literally are sitting on the side of the road, not knowing where to go.

It took so long, she finally apologized and said her manager will call me back but it might take a couple of hours.  That was a couple of hours ago and we have still not heard back.  

So now it is the long weekend, virtually everything is booked up.  We are 1800 km from home and spent 3 days travelling to this Vrbo.  It seems impossible to get in touch with the relocation team and now we can’t even try to book a Vrbo on our own for tonight because it appears the site doesn’t allow same day bookings.  

This has ruined our vacation.  I’m so stressed about this and I can’t believe Vrbo isn’t doing more to assist us.  Does anyone have advice or know how to reach the relocation team?",806,221,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1eiky6e/help_our_vrbo_was_abandoned_and_we_are_stranded/,2024-08-02 20:52:52,Vrbo
Vrbo,"VRBO Nightmare: Chargeback Debacle Leaves Me Debited $6,886.22","Hey everyone,

I’m dealing with an absolute nightmare with VRBO, and I could really use some advice or at least some solidarity. Here’s what’s been going on:

A guest stayed at my property in mid-June, and everything seemed fine until I got an email from VRBO in August saying that a $6,886.22 chargeback had been filed. Naturally, I reached out to VRBO right away, and they assured me that they would look into it. They told me not to contact the guest directly at that point and to follow up with them in a few days.

Fast forward a few days, I contacted VRBO again, only to be told that the $6,886.22 would be debited from my account in just a couple of days. Their advice? Go to the property with the police to ask the guest what happened. So, I did as they said, and to my surprise, the guest was just as shocked as I was. He informed me that VRBO had actually told him to file the chargeback because they didn’t want to issue him the refund they owed him.

After a lot of back-and-forth and nearly four hours on the phone with VRBO, they finally admitted that the guest was given incorrect information. The guest even sent me a screenshot from his bank showing that the chargeback had been reversed, he was recharged for the stay, and the case was officially closed. I thought that would be the end of it, but no.

Today, I checked my account, and guess what? VRBO still debited the $6,886.22. I’m beyond furious. I spoke with VRBO again, and now they’re saying the dispute is somehow still ongoing and that it could take up to two months to resolve. They won’t even consider a three-way call with the guest’s bank to clarify the situation, which just makes this whole process even more frustrating.

So here I am, caught in a mess that never should have involved me, waiting for VRBO to get their act together. Has anyone else dealt with something like this? Any advice on what I can do next?


UPDATE: VRBO has finally confirmed that the chargeback was settled in my favor (the funds were deducted last week Monday), and they’ll disburse the $6,886.22 back to my account in 30 days. I’ve seen comments suggesting VRBO might hold funds for interest purposes—is that what’s going on here? Can I push for an earlier payment?


FINAL UPDATE: The funds were returned to my account on August 23rd. This whole ordeal has been a real learning experience and has unlocked so many fears about relying on third-party platforms. I genuinely hope anyone else going through something similar gets their money back.",755,169,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1exc6k2/vrbo_nightmare_chargeback_debacle_leaves_me/,2024-08-21 00:49:04,Vrbo
Vrbo,"The heck is a ""Host Fee"" on VRBO and why is it absurdly expensive?","I expect them to add taxes and fees on top of the $123, but for it to jump to $225 a night feels like actual false advertising (this is all over vrbo.com with varying levels of ridiculous)",670,264,https://i.redd.it/g93f2k4e3oub1.jpg,2023-10-17 01:40:50,Vrbo
Vrbo,Swearing off VRBO/BNB type trips forever,"I’ve had my last awful experience on these apps. We had a 5 night stay in Rome scheduled in October. Something came up with my work and rescheduling became unavoidable. The hosts policy was 0% refunded within 15 days. This was day 14. Fine. I respect that. No need to ask for a refund. 

So, we ask if our host is willing to reschedule at full price. We even offered to pay an increased price if the rate changed due to the new dates. Radio silence. For four days. Nothing. 

Then we contact VRBO. They message the host. She refuses to reschedule. We contact VRBO again they say this is unusual but they can’t do anything about it. VRBO recommends filing a claim on the insurance policy we purchased during check out. 

The insurance policy is filed and they rule that nothing can be done if the host simply decides they don’t want to reschedule. 

The trip window comes and goes. We are charged $1,400 for the stay for which we never set foot inside the property. I realize that based on technicality there is literally nothing to be done. I get it. It’s on me. But this is the absolute last straw for me using a shared property app for vacation or business. 

Rome was one of three cities we planned to visit on a long European vacation. It was also the only VRBO/AirBnB we had scheduled. Meaning, I had to reschedule two intercontinental flights, three international European flights, four other hotels, four other rental car bookings and several other miscellaneous attractions. All of those caused 0 issues and I was charged nothing for changing my dates. But because VRBO has nothing to do with the properties themselves I get stuck in a loophole that cost me $1,400. And don’t let the extravagance of this trip fool you. We saved for this trip for 5 years. Losing that amount of money isn’t something inconsequential for us. 

If anyone has any other methods or strategy for us to try and recoup any of our money I’ll gladly try anything. Thanks for reading my rant and sorry if I ruffle any feathers.

Edit: thanks for the continued responses. I had to stop replying because many of the comments became fixated on how unfair I was being to the property owner. I had repeatedly engaged with this point but I’m exhausted from responding the same thing over and over again  to COMPLETELY CLARIFY: I don’t expect the owner to lose money because of me. I accept that the fault is on me. I accept that no refund is coming nor do I expect it. The point of my post was that traveling with property sharing apps has too many variables that could go wrong for my situation and I won’t be using them anymore. I was interested in the discussion and many of you had excellent points. Thanks for engaging with my post! 

Final edit: A solution to this problem would be for VRBO to offer some sort of premium rate to guests to help in my particular case. They are owned by an 18 billion dollar company and could be expected to help absorb these types of VERY COMMON travel woes. Large hotels do it. And they can to.",572,228,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/185yl9p/swearing_off_vrbobnb_type_trips_forever/,2023-11-28 15:26:05,Vrbo
Vrbo,"If a host cancels hours before, should VRBO find you a replacement at no extra expense, or should the listing have a 30 day public warning?","Right now, a host can cancel last minute with no warning to future guests, and the guest that loses their reservation is left with useless VRBO chatbots and often extra costs. Should VRBO offer more to guests in these situations (with some maximum), or at least warn future reservations? Or what do you think should be done?

=====My details below, not needed to answer the question=====
Posting my details here in case others find themselves in a similar situation: booked 2 days before the trip, got ""instant confirmation"", and another confirmation + check-in info day before.

Hours before the reservation, after we landed, the host messaged: ""there was an error with the VRBO calendar syncing with their AirBNB calendar"" they accidentally double booked the place since ""both reservations were made almost at the same time""

So they cancelled ours since we booked slightly after the first group, said we'll get a refund, apologized, said we could try to find another place and warned hotels were very expensive. VRBO support was a useless chat bot. The only available place was 2x the capacity for 2x the cost and that was what we had to do. My hunch is there was no calendar sync error, they accidentally approved both and cancelled the cheaper listing. I know little change will probably happen from this post, so the hope is this post will encourage other users to post how unreliable the platform can be and maybe get the eyes of VRBO to make some changes.

 Because this is Formula 1 weekend hotels are few and far between and the available ones are extremely expensive. Called VRBO customer service and they told us that since we left the property, even though we were asked to, that they can’t help us.

The lock box was empty. My two kids and I were traveling for 12 hours and had no shelter, bathroom, anything. A stranger saw us and opened the lobby door and asked “was your lockbox empty too?”  I was another guest (who somehow got in the lobby) who also had nowhere to go…same owner of the rental they booked.  I called Vrbo and they told me they only deal with access issues, which this was, but they “cannot help or do anything” for me. I told them I want a refund and they repeated “we only deal with access, and you cannot get a refund if you voluntarily go to a hotel.”   I asked “how is it voluntary for me to get a hotel…I have nowhere for my kids and I to take shelter overnight?” They had no reply. I wanted to cry.  I am now in a hotel (that cost 1.5 times more than my Vrbo rental) and have zero returned communication with the owner and vrbo.

Vrbo,So many cancellations.  I am leaning toward not using VRBO in the future,"I see so many cancellations by hosts happening within the last 24 hours on this sub reddit.  My wife and I have used VRBO exclusively in the last 3 years for our annual trip in February.  It seems that VRBO is not terribly concerned with correcting the problems and finding a solution for it's customers.  Getting your money back, via the credit card company seems to be the go to for resolution, but this only solves part of the problem.  With no notice, and no time to find similar accommodations, it seems that hotels are the go to answer.  We always book for a group of 4, which means two hotel rooms at the mercy of the market rate.  Since we are travelling for events that are very well attended, hotels rooms are a very expensive option.

Does VRBO make good on the cost up of these cancellations?  What about having to purchase meals at restaurants instead of cooking in the reserved rental?  Is VRBO making good on these costs?  It seems from the many complaints that VRBO is not doing a very good job of keeping it's customers happy, when the hosts double book or just change their mind.

Please help me to understand why we should continue to book, when there are so many scary stories of disappointed customers who are not receiving help when the hosts cancel.  It seems to me that you are rolling the dice that the host doesn't find someone else to rent his property at a better price point.",312,92,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1dsf8hj/so_many_cancellations_i_am_leaning_toward_not/,2024-06-30 23:55:41,Vrbo
Vrbo,Awful Experience With VRBO. Will be homeless on Christmas Eve.,"First time using VRBO to plan a last minute trip for my wife and I to Kings Beach in North Lake Tahoe at a place called The Chalet at Kings Beach. Was suppose to check in to Sunday 12/24 and check out Thursday, 12/28. When I arrived to check in on Sunday at approximately 5pm, the host literally cancelled on me while I was on the call with him.

I immediately called VRBO, and after talking to numerous reps, being on holds for hours, disconnects, etc, we finally got an escalation after 3.5 hours, where we were approved to be reimburses for 2 nights of hotels stays at $174 a night... Except there is literally nothing in the vicinity for that price and no availability for anything besides a place that cost $600 on Sunday night. Called VRBO again and they confirmed that there is nothing they can do for us tonight. After 5+ total long exhausting hours, it looks like we will be homeless on Christmas Eve. 

We were able to self book 3 nights at a place with availability starting Monday 12/25 to Thursday 12/28 a place close by, but it's still $250/night, which is still way over the VRBO reimbursement. I am hoping VRBO will at least do the right thing and cover the full amount for the three nights as they are the reason we are sleeping in the car tonight. Not exactly the last minute Christmas Tahoe adventure we were hoping for. 

Hope your Christmas Eve is going better than ours.

Any advise from anyone that has experienced this? (I really wouldn't wish this experience on anyone.)

A situation happened where I needed to cancel a booking. I cancelled the booking within 20 minutes, informed the guest ahead of time. This was during a very slow time, when 75% of the inventory in the neighborhood was available. The guest had plenty of options and it did not leave them in a bind. I felt terrible, nonetheless. Cancelling bookings is not something I consider an option and certainly something that I ever want to do again.

Vrbo,Broken Stove Leads To Gas Being Unable To Be Shut Off - Vrbo Tells Us To Stay,"The ""short"" of it is we realized on day 2 of our stay that the very old, bad condition stove on the property has had its dial set on ""4"" since we first walked in here. We instinctively tried to shut it off only to find out the dial has been turned counter clockwise at least one rotation more than it's suppose to go and that gas is coming out of the stove despite being on ""off"" and that we have absolutely no way of telling if the gas has truly been turned off (we did try ripping the dial off, it didn't help). We eventually shut off the gas valve and unplugged the stove.

We contacted the Vrbo who got a hold of the host, who hadn't respond to our messages, and said they'd send someone out tomorrow morning. It was 12am so we understood. We asked Vrbo if they could pay for a place to stay since we didn't want to stay in a place with a possible gas leak, and honestly we didn't want to go back since it was such a bad experience.

They told us since the host offered to correct the mistake we had to wait until tomorrow morning. And they stay won't be canceled. Despite escalating the situation to travel care they just said the only thing we could do is ask for a refund from the host and that they won't be helping us at all.

Am I asking for too much here? Am I overreacting? What is the best course of action now? We've looked for a place to stay for more than an hour now and we probably have to go back to the original property.

Host double booked and is telling me I need to cancel less than 24 hours before check in. I refused. I understand the penalties are harsh for a host who cancels. But now I must find a new place to stay for a trip I am leaving for in the morning. Host stated they contacted VRBO support and that I am supposed to cancel in order to get a full refund. The reservation has a no cancellation policy, I used One Key cash for part of the fee and I would be the one at risk for getting any refund if I cancel.  
When I contacted support, the rep told me I could cancel and the rep would handle the refund outside of the normal VRBO channels in order to refund me the full amount. I refused to be the one who cancelled as this would put me at risk. I was not aware that VRBO now wants the guest to cancel when the reservation the host was the one who cancelled and trust that they will be refunded.

VRBO needs to stop telling the guest to cancel when the host double books. VRBO also did not offer to find me comparable accommodations. If there were decent hotels in the area, I would not have used VRBO.

Vrbo,Refund Advice- VRBO Booked for W. Carolina Mountains 3 weeks from now ,"Second update- we have decided to move our trip to the spring and the host had graciously agreed.

Update- we have decided to go as long as our host is able to still have us. We are waiting to hear back from her. Thank you to everyone with the helpful advice and updates regarding the state of the area. 

Original: We have a VRBO booked in Waynesville, NC three weeks from now. They are going through a national emergency right now and it’s going to be months of rebuilding, and it won’t be safe or possible to visit in 3 weeks. I’m devastated for the area but I am unsure of what to do to get our money back. 

How do I go about getting a refund? Do I contact VRBo directly? Not even sure if the owner has service it’s that bad. We are past the 100% refund date and the 50% refund date is by 10/3. I would assume since it’s impossible to get there- we would be fully refunded?

Vrbo,Never Book VRBO - Damage scam,"Breaking my 8 year Reddit lurking streak to warn people away from VRBO.

I booked a VRBO in Chicago for a group of friends in June. Conversations I had with the host before were normal and the place had excellent reviews (only 9 total though). To start, I had paid extra for early check-in and late checkout. The property used a timed door code (a specific numeric code for a set period of time) and the host clearly forgot to adjust the timing on the door code because neither my early check-in OR late checkout worked (my group was locked out of the property). Not a huge issue and the host refunded the extra I had paid for this.

The real nightmare began 3 days after we left. The host texted me, accusing me of significant damages (blood, holes in wall, destroyed mirrors, etc). Thankfully, I had taken a video of the entire property as we were leaving (for this exact situation) and I asked him if he could send pictures of the property to compare to the video I had taken. He didn't respond. I got the feeling then that he was trying to scam extra money from me and decided to drop it when I mentioned I had proof in the form of a walkthrough video.

3 weeks after this, I received a message through VRBO app where he quoted me 975$ in damages and a charge was placed against my credit card. I spoke with VRBO at this point who assured me the charge would not go through until a full investigation had occurred. I even sent an email to the VRBO support person at this time (at their request) with my proof video (which I was told over the phone was sufficient at that time). Unfortunately, I was still charged 975$ a few days later when the charges went through.

I have now been fighting back and forth with VRBO and have called them 3-4 times. At my last call, they informed me that they had been in contact with the host by email and BY EMAIL THE HOST HAD ADMITTED THE CHARGES WERE A MISTAKE. I asked for a copy of this email, but they told me the communication was private and they could not send me a copy. VRBO has never been able to reach the host by phone (obviously dodging calls). It's now been over a month with proof that the VRBO host ""mistakenly"" charged my card and VRBOs solution has been to repeatedly call the host. VRBO support has told me that they cannot refund the money and must rely on the host to refund the money (I have 0 hope that the host will do this).

I spoke with my bank and thankfully they are working to refund this (but still have not received). I was also told that this is not a unique situation and to cancel my credit card so that the host cannot charge it again. Basically, that this was a form of fraud with unauthorized charges against the credit card.

All this to say, please do not book VRBO, even if the property has good reviews. Support is not able to help you and cannot stop the host from fraudulently charging your card. The host, apparently, has free rein and can charge your card whenever they want with whatever factitious charges they can make up. I used AirBNB for a decade before this with 0 issues (and a 5 star guest rating). Not to say AirBNB is perfect, but certainly a better experience so far.

Vrbo,First time in a VRBO was a disaster,"I rented a VRBO for myself and 4 coworkers on a recent out-of-state work trip (against my will).  After booking, I received communications from three different companies relating to my booking.  Weird, but ok.  I finally got through the gauntlet with those people and began receiving messages from the host.  All was friendly and professional.

Upon arrival the first evening, there was a business card slipped under the front door.  It said ""Call <number> ASAP"", had business hours listed, a hand written reference number, and the date.  I tossed it on the table and ignored it.  The following day there was a 2nd identical card tucked into the door gap.  I took a photo and sent it to the host.  I looked up the number and it was for a vehicle repossession company.  Interesting.  The host messaged me back and said they were looking into it.

On the 3rd day, my team and I had been out doing some field work all day in the pouring rain (got about 3"").  We were soaked and looking forward to hot showers and doing some laundry.  Shortly after we arrived we found that the water had been shut off.  I messaged the host ASAP to inquire.  They messaged back right away and said they were looking into it.  While waiting for a follow-up, I called the city water dept. to see if there was an area outage.  They indicated there was no outage or service work being done at that address, but couldn't give me much more information as I was not the home owner and did not know the owner's name (the host I was messaging with was not the owner either).  After explaining that I needed to make a decision on whether to bail due to the uncertainty whether or not the water service would be restored, I was told it had been shut off due to non-payment.

While I was on the phone with the water dept, I got a word-salad voicemail from someone at one of the three companies affiliated with this booking which was full of nonsense.  The individual explained that the city was doing some work in the area and that the host had escalated my message to their Operations Team and their Maintenance Team would be looking into it and communicating with the Local Neighborhood Ambassador Teams, whatever all that means.

Meanwhile, my coworkers were collecting water from the downspouts using a trash can just so we could flush toilets.  After waiting 2 hours without resolution and doubting that there was any way all those fancy-named teams were gonna get the water bill paid, especially since the water dept was now closed, we made the decision to book the rest of our trip at the local roach-motel and leave the property.

I spoke to VRBO customer service the next day to inquire about a pro-rated refund, but was told that since the host uses their own system, I'd have to take it up with them.  Do I have any recourse here?",49,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1h0kqcw/first_time_in_a_vrbo_was_a_disaster/,2024-11-26 19:41:08,Vrbo

When I arrive the area was absolutely impoverished. Homeless encampments, a bus on the street with a large crowd gathered at it, piles of trash on the sidewalks, but all of this is truly not even relevant to my major complaint. There was a smart lock on the door, with an 8 digit code. The code did not work. It was 10:30 PM when we arrived, and even though we were somewhat nervous about it, we tired the code no less than 20 times. I messaged the host and did not hear back until the next day, after I got a hotel room. I called VRBO and they said they needed video proof of the code not working. I went BACK OUT and got video evidence of the door lock not working. At this point I feel pretty certain those images are not behind that door, not only would it not be a good investment, but with the code not working, it starts to look like a scam listing.

I called them no less than 10 times, MULTIPLE escalations, talked to a manager. Their end verdict? That my check in time was 2:00 pm and I didn't contact the host until 10:30 pm. My flight had been cancelled so I had to drive and that was the time I arrived.

Vrbo,VRBO Host Refusing Refund After Safety Issues in “Luxury Rental”—Thinking About Small Claims Court (Pics Included),"
Need some advice. I booked a luxury rental in Virginia for one month, and while the place kinda looked like the photos, the quality was just… “poor”. Here’s what I walked into:

•	Smoke defector/ fire alarms covered with plastic bags (major fire hazard).

•	Furniture didn’t match the photos—super uncomfortable and broken (sofa had no legs, beds were bulging).

•	Several lights didn’t work, and the whole place felt rundown.

•     Broken glass mirror/ chipped doors


I reached out to VRBO, and they agreed that I should be refunded under their Book with Confidence Guarantee because of the safety concerns and misrepresentation. The host, however, only refunded me $375 out of over $6,000, and it’s been a week with no progress from VRBO.

At this point, I’m thinking about filing in small claims court and reporting the fire safety violations to the fire marshal. 

Has anyone dealt with something similar?

Vrbo,"VRBO Host Asked Me to Cancel, Still Available On Airbnb?","This morning I was browsing VRBO looking for housing for a large group for a weekend (3 days) and I found an incredible spot. The price was really great so I booked it. 

Not long after I received a message from the host saying they no longer work with VRBO and that I should cancel my booking.

Naturally I reached out to support because I wasn't sure if it was legitimate. I use VRBO a lot and this had never happened before. They said the listing is active. Then I received a phone call, then text from the host telling me that I need to cancel. All of this in about a 30 minute window.

The listing is on Airbnb for about $7,000 more, so I assume it was a mistake in pricing. The host has been on both platforms for 3 years and has several other properties. I wouldn't want to hurt someone financially for keeping my listing, but they seem to be fine in that regard. 

I know that they are in violation of both VRBO and Airbnb terms of service by not removing the other listing now that it's booked.  

  
My questions are: is there a way for VRBO and Airbnb to communicate a booking so that it is not double booked? Should I ask the host to remove the airbnb listing? Should I book the Airbnb as well (free cancellation for a while yet, so I wouldn't have to pay) and let them know I'm happy to report them to both platforms if they don't honor my original booking? Hate to do the last one, but I feel this is poor behavior by them after they essentially harassed me and went way out of bounds to try to get me to cancel a legitimate booking.

Vrbo,Does VRBO have no consumer protections? Hosts committing fraud.,"I had a host return our deposit and cancel after claiming they ""accidently"" double booked but coincidently the other booking was months later at a higher cost on a different platform.  After reading posts on this sub and talking to others I have to wonder if VRBO is being utilized as a vehicle of fraud. 

There is nothing VRBO is doing to prevent hosts from accepting reservations and the deposits of guests upwards of $10,000 for months then posting the same product at a higher cost elsewhere and canceling on the original guests last minute. Since they (VRBO) are requiring a significant deposit that is providing no protection for the consumer, they are essentially encouraging fraud if not downright assisting in it. The consumer is left assured that the reservation is theirs.

After the likely fraud the original guests are stuck purchasing at a much higher cost last minute and the host has no repercussions for bidding up their property while its ""reserved""

I have legal insurance and since rebooking a new property for 18 people is going to cost me upwards of 5k more I'm considering reaching out to our firm.

This was a 1000$ mistake, so please for the love of God someone tell me there's a way to fix this. This is not my money. And we're supposed to be leaving tomorrow morning and now have no where to stay. This is the dumbest thing I could have done today. Please someone help me. 



Edit:  lol yall are wild in the comments. I genuinely did not think this post was gonna get THAt much attention but I guess I should go ahead and make an update on the situation. 

As I've said to some in the comments, I managed to get the trip canceled and most of the money refunded. So yay! I already booked another hotel at my actual destination, so we can actually go today lol. 


Also just to clarify, some people think I waited until the last minute to do this lol. 
I was told we were taking this trip like 2 days before I booked it, which I managed to book the day before we were supposed to leave. My husband and I were both looking for places to stay. We had been doing a lot of shit that day so I was extremely exhausted and not being as thorough as I normally would. I found this place, it was in the same list I was looking at for places actually in Oklahoma, and it said Lake Murray so I guess that was all my sleepy brain needed. 
I went to look at the booking again, and noticed my mistake before going to bed at 2 AM when it was far to late to really do anything about it, so I went to sleep and called customer support first thing in the morning. 
I hope that clears up any misunderstanding about the situation lol.

Vrbo,Warning: Terrible Experience with VRBO - Unfair Host Practices and Fraud,"Hey fellow travelers,

I just wanted to share our recent nightmare experience with VRBO. We booked a place only to find out it was under extensive construction(super host never disclosed), including workers on the roof and decks. To make matters worse, my wife encountered a creepy situation when she opened the blinds in her underwear to find a worker on the master bedroom deck staring at her.

We complained to the host, who dismissively suggested, ""if the dude is on the balcony…close the blinds."" Shockingly, our complaints to VRBO led to false accusations of damaging the thermostat, washing machine, and dishwasher. The host even submitted fake or incorrect invoices and altered text threads to falsely frame us for blackmail.

In our attempt to resolve the issue, we did a chargeback with AMEX. The host responded with the posted text message attempting fraud. Despite providing evidence of the altered invoice and proving it incorrect, VRBO's chargeback team selectively submitted documents to defend the host and skew the narrative. We’ve re-opened the case with AMEX and submitted additional evidence. 

Be cautious when using VRBO – it seems they're more inclined to side with hosts than protect guests. Has anyone else faced similar issues with VRBO or have advice on how to navigate such situations?

I’ll post the full story and an update when AMEX makes their final determination, one way or the other.",160,60,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18o3nzb,2023-12-22 01:59:11,Vrbo
Vrbo,Do Not Book With Vrbo Unless You Like a Gamble ;),"So I am adding my drop of warning to the ocean of similar stories on Reddit, X, Facebook, Tripadvisor, and elsewhere in hopes that someone might read it and avoid the sad and frustrating (and expensive) ordeal we're going through.

Right after we booked, we started to get a bad feeling about the host when he asked us to communicate off-platform, and stopped responding on Vrbo altogether. 

Some new reviews popped up on both of his listings, and all of them were horrendous. People never getting into an apartment at all after arriving, people being forced to pay $800 on some outside app in order to get the keycode, etc.

We called Vrbo to report what seemed like scamming or fraudulent practice, and to get a refund or a replacement booking.

Vrbo asked for screenshots of our off-site conversation, reviewed his reviews, tried unsuccessfully to reach him via phone or email, etc. They escalated the case to fraud investigation and de-platformed the host, but they refused to give us a refund or different lodging.

They said we would have to wait a month, go to the property, try to check-in, and if that didn't work then call them from there for help. Since we'd be traveling to a freezing city at the end of November with a small child, we of course could not risk that fiasco and we booked a different place (thanks Airbnb) we could count on.

Fast-forward a month, a few days before checkin, and Vrbo sent me an email with the ""address"" to my booking (but no apartment # etc.)... It was 6 km / 4 miles from the listing location. 

Still no responses, ever, from the host. 

I called Vrbo from the airport, reported the above, and they tried again unsuccessfully to contact the host. That customer rep was the 2nd or 3rd in many hours of phone calls over this month to say we were eligible for a refund, but no refund is given and when I inquired about that after we were home they say the person must have been mistaken.

Vrbo says it's between us and the (completely unresponsive, de-platformed) host.

PS I have tried disputing the charge with my Barclays credit card, but they proclaimed the charge was valid and I had to go through Vrbo or the host if I wanted to keep seeking a refund. 

Based on the infinity of stories I've read now online that are nearly identical to ours, I am pretty sure we're never getting our money back. I hope there's some slight chance someone reads this early enough (like I didn't...) to not make the same mistake.

Vrbo poses as a hospitality company, but they are merely a Craigslist type of website, that posts everything from everyone indiscriminately, and is not accountable for what happens between hosts and guests. 

They told me as much several times, when I tried to question their lack of accountability. Be warned, if possible.

Vrbo,VRBO small claims court?,"I need some help. Has anyone ever sued VRBO and successfully gotten paid the judgement (if you won the case)?

Backstory:
We rented a vrbo for 14 nights. We got to the house and the AC was not functional. We contacted the host and vrbo to let them know. It was the middle of summer in triple digit heat. After many hours of waiting they sent a repairman who told us we had to wait for the unit to defrost to see what the issue is. We had to go buy fans to make it tolerable to sleep. We even looked at all the vents and found that they were filthy and  hadn't been changed in a while, which is probably why the AC wasn't working. Well another day passed and they couldn't figure out how to fix the AC. So we called  vrbo and they said we could leave the rental and  they would give us back our money plus an extra 50% to find new accomodations through hotels.com (same ownership group). 
We secured housing through hotels.com as they told us to. Well, now it's been over a month and they have not refunded us. We have called/emailed 10 times. They keep just saying we need to wait for this or that. Or the person that answers has no idea what we are talking about and is absolutely useless. Overall, we are out about $3,500.

I contacted VRBO and they assured me the host was reputable and that paying via wire transfer was okay. So I went to my bank and did the wire transfer for $8,000. Today, 6 days later, I received an email from VRBO Support that the property has been determined to be not legitimate and has been removed from the VRBO website. Not only that but the email was sent to me plus about 60 other people. We can all see each others email addresses, and several people have reported the same situation as mine - they were hesitant when requested to pay via wire transfer, but reached out to VRBO and were reassured that the host was reputable and that making payment via wire transfer was fine. Has anyone else been scammed through VRBO in this way?",55,47,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1ctu3y7/got_scammed_via_vrbo/,2024-05-17 02:04:11,Vrbo
Vrbo,VRBO Host threatening Small Claims litigation based on 3/5 review,"This is a long one, so TLDR (questions below): Booked in February for a April stay at VRBO. Host contacts me shortly before rentals with additional instructions to read and acknowledge. Stay comes and goes. Place is whack, but fine enough and as expected. Leave 3/5 review. 4 months pass and owner begins harassing me about the review and threatens litigation. VRBO support engaged. Owner escalates to filled out court forms that have yet to be filed claiming $500 + $2665 in lost revenue.

I booked a place in Washington for me and my extended family on mid-February, for stay at end of April. Booking process was easy, completely done through VRBO.

Roughly a week out from our stay, I get a text from the owner asking to go over some information related to the place. When I indicate I'm available to go over this information, I'm presented with 2 pictures of letter-sized printed out documents to read and then acknowledge that I've read and understand.

The first document is a description of the place with a few items about house rules, such as make sure the dishwasher is run and emptied before leaving, contact the host with any needs/problems rather than leaving a negative review, and a hand written bit about not charging a security deposit, but reserving the right to retroactively claim a security deposit if policies and instructions on VRBO and in these texted documents are not followed (these last two in particular will come into play later).

The second document is a tirade on how the house is not updated, go somewhere else if you want a upscale experience. Essentially a ""lower your expectations"" message. Sure whatever, not going to try and find a new location this close to our trip. Read and understood

After that, two more images, one of a dog policy and a recap of house rules with a quick hit of the instructions for checkout. Read/understood.

We stay in the place and, as advertised, it is not updated. 90s construction with some DIY/Landlord grade repairs. But there are things that move this from ""dated"" to ""dilapidated"". Rugs are nailed down to a carpeted floor in a couple places in the living room, and have been re-nailed with previous nails still embedded into the carpet. Cutting boards are screwed down to the counters, making them impossible to clean. Some of the cutting boards have felt pads (typically used on furniture feet to prevent scratching hardwood floors) covering the screws presumably to prevent damage to knives, so that's gross and unsanitary. One of the couches has a broken sub-structure, so it sags as you sit on it. There's an old couch that has been out in the rain on the deck showing signs of mold/mildew. Speaking of the deck, I think a good kick to one of the posts could send it down, the metal brackets for the deck posts have corroded to the point of being dust, or thin enough to flake. A connected lower deck, admittedly better build, has a hot tub on it. Stairs from upper to lower deck have inconsistent steps, violating building code. The hot tub sits at the edge of the deck with UV degraded, and broken plastic lattice providing a bit of privacy, but would no doubt fail if even a child leaned against it, sending them 8' down to the ground. Two of the advertised 5 bedrooms exist in an un-permitted garage conversion (a permit was pulled, but never completed and subsequently expired). One of the beds in one of the un-permitted bedrooms had a broken box-spring, which we didn't use. There is some mold in the shower and on windows

All of these things we accepted. We're easy going travelers, and have no interest in having our vacation disrupted by bringing these issues up, and having the host/owner come to handle any of it. We enjoyed our stay well enough, but nobody in the group was sad to checkout of the place, and we will not be coming back.

After stay, I get the VRBO email request to review. Which I do. I give a 3/5 rating, and start to write about the things above. While writing the review, I began to have the feeling of ""If you can't say anything nice, don't say it."" Listing out the issues that I had with the place was making it difficult to not downgrade my 3/5 rating. So I removed the text, and simply submitted the rating.

Fast-forward almost 4 months, and I get a few messages from the owner asking to respond to him. Since I've got no business with him, I don't respond. One day passes and he hits me up with a message asking for clarification of the ""negative review"" that I left. I'm out doing something else, don't respond. 2.5 hours later, I get a longer text message explaining how the owner has had cancellations as a direct result of my review, and because I didn't follow the ""policy"" of contacting the owner directly, quote, ""...litigation through the courts is a necessity because we may get more cancellations as a direct result...""

I respond to him at this point. 4 months since the stay, I don't even remember what my review was. I pull up the site to check it out, and I can't see it because the host had deactivated their listing. I ask the host to provide me my review, since I don't recall what I had put in it. In the next message, host says listing is deactivated due to the poor review. If I'd be willing to remove it, he'll be ok with the revenue lost as ""a direct result"" of the bad review and won't pursue things further. Here we enter into a violation of VRBOs extortion policy:

""Our [Content Guidelines](https://www.vrbo.com/lp/b/content-guidelines) expressly prohibit extorting owners/managers or guests for money or any other consideration. 

* Guests can't threaten to use a review against you to obtain refunds or additional compensation. 
* Owners/managers can’t mandate a review in exchange for refunds, or ask the guest to revise a review for compensation. ""

Host forwards me the review later the next day. 3/5 rating, not text review. This jogs my memory to what I had put up a few paragraphs back. But I don't respond that day. Another day passes and he bugs me about it again. I respond requesting that he communicate with me through VRBO's platform, which he does. In the message on VRBO he doesn't explicitly say that he will pursue litigation unless the review is dropped, but does say ""...delete that review so then I well \[sic\] not pursue this any further."" 

Good enough for me. I contact VRBO support, tell them what all is going on with a host harassing me to remove a review (which I don't even think is possible on the VRBO platform) or face litigation. VRBO support is sympathetic, issues a case number on it, and says they will contact the host to discuss. 

The next day (yesterday), I get another few images of printed documents that are small claim court filings, that haven't yet been filed. Form states the case is due to ""Rental Policy violation"". Forms claim a $500 retroactive deposit (remember that bit about reserving the right to claim a deposit if policies are not followed?) and $2665 in lost revenue based on cancellations (no proof presented). Host says the will no be using VRBO anymore (not sure if that means that they won't/can't list their properties on VRBO, won't communicate through the VRBO platform, or both). Not sure at this point if VRBO has contacted the host or not, but I suspect they have. I will be following up with them today. 

I've captured images of all messages that have occurred between me and the host since first direct interaction in April. No interaction has occurred via phone or email, just text messages and VRBO inbox.

So that leads me to ask for some insight from reddit here.  

* First, my understanding is that if booking/paying through VRBO, all rental agreements are presented before booking. This comes from VRBO's trust page (https://www.vrbo.com/trust/owner-manager). Does that track with other's understandings? 
* Second, as stated before, there were issues with the place, but nothing that we needed or wanted the owner to take care of while we were there. Owners secondary documents asked me to contact if we had a need or problem. We had no needs or problems, we just stayed at a place that we won't come back to. Even if the secondary document does hold up to legal scrutiny, I feel like I didn't violate the policy, as I needed nothing from the owner. Thoughts? 

My next steps are to contact a local lawyer to provide some guidance, and contact VRBO again to bring up this recent escalation, and gain clarity from VRBO on the rental policy that was agreed to on booking back in February. Any other steps folks would suggest? ",12,34,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1f8xvkz/vrbo_host_threatening_small_claims_litigation/,2024-09-04 16:35:34,Vrbo
Vrbo,VRBO IS TERRIBLE! USELESS DAMAGE INSURANCE,"DO NOT HOST ON VRBO!!!!  The property damage insurance coverage offered by VRBO's CSA Travel Protection company is so incredibly incompetent. We had a guest who violated every rule and trashed our home. Pretended to be staying while allowing kids to stay who smoked, caused excessive damage, were filthy, ran the air conditioner to 60 degrees causing excessive condensation and peeling paint, mud everywhere, all over the furniture, walls, floors, they were building/repairing bridges, food everywhere which attracted pests, etc. We thought we were going to be compensated at least for a little bit of the over $10K of damage to the home, thanks to the property damage insurance that we require all guests to purchase. WE WERE SO WRONG. This company refuses to cooperate whatsoever and ignores all of our messages, images, information and keeps closing our claim for reasons that are false (claims we don't respond when we do immediately).

Vrbo,VRBO ALLOWS HOSTS DELETE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! Beware of Balsam Lake Ontario Sand Beach “Welcome to Castaway Beach “Clean shallow water.,"Don't mind me – I'm just here to post a review that I know will be deleted by VRBO hosts. Hoping it helps some folks save their money and book elsewhere.

**VRBO Details:**

>Listing: Balsam Lake Ontario Sand Beach “Welcome to Castaway Beach “Clean shallow water  
Location: Kawartha Lakes, ON, K0M 1N0 Canada  
Host: Peter

It’s clear why this property isn’t listed on Airbnb—Vrbo seems to allow reviews to be deleted, and that's exactly what's happening here. Although the listing says there are 18 reviews, only 10 are visible and all from 2023. The rating has dropped significantly since my booking, likely because 8 negative reviews have been removed. I'm sure mine will be deleted too, but I’ll be posting this elsewhere where the host can’t control it.

I booked this place for a bachelorette party and was deeply embarrassed before even stepping inside. The outside looked like a junkyard, garbage everywhere, broken appliances and tarps covering god-knows. Inside, none of the light switches work and most of the lamps had blown bulbs with no replacements available. The property has three fridges, but only one is functional and free of mold. Bedding isn't provided, which wasn’t mentioned in the booking details or by the host, so I had run out and buy bedding for eight beds which is not cheap.

The beach area was just as bad. The volleyball net is on the verge of collapsing. The sand is unkept to the point we had to rake it ourselves. The outdoor furniture could use a clean, we didn't feel comfortable unless we used our towels. Also, the beach and water aren’t private; there are neighbours right next to you.

I’ve stayed in so many rentals and this is the most disappointing experience I’ve ever had—so much so that I’m try to get a partial refund and reimbursement for the bedding, but the host has stopped responding to Vrbo.

Please save your money and disappointment—book elsewhere.

–––

**Update:**

VRBO customer service is just as disappointing as this stay. I reached out to them twice during my stay, but they were unable to contact the host. However today I called customer service to follow-up, and they *apparently* were able to reach the host while I was on a brief hold.

They informed me that no action could be taken because the host refuses to provide a partial refund or refund for the bedding, claiming the bedding was mentioned in the listing (I have screen shots proving this is not true)—VRBO customer service then advised me to resolve this issue directly with the host and provided me with this contact info.

Vrbo,Cancellations,"About 2 years ago I booked 5 days in Tampa with my wife on VRBO. Late the night before we were supposed to fly out,  Less than 12 hours before we were supposed to check in, we got an email saying the reservation was canceled. I was dumbfounded. Why were they allowed to even do that? To make matters worse, we couldn't even leave a negative review because we didn't have a reservation. 

Today I am in Austin for 10 days. I have a reservation on VRBO. I get an email just 90 minutes before check in that it's canceled. What the AF?! How on earth is that allowed?!

Again I am just shocked. Now I have to scramble for a new place and I'm sure this flakey owner has done this before and will do it again and the system will not capture the negative experience. But I can and will shout far and wide for people to avoid VRBO.",1262,312,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1ds8guz/cancellations/,2024-06-30 18:48:22,Vrbo

Vrbo,VRBO left me stranded," A year ago my wife and I rented a large cabin for 8 family members to gather for my son’s graduation. The plan was to have his two roommates and their parents back for dinner after graduation. Very casual. We received a VRBO email that the owner will be contacting us but as we were nearing the end of our 3 1/2-4 hour drive to the house we realized we didn’t have the actual instructions to enter the house. My wife called and left a message for the owner who called right back and said the house was double booked. She swore this had never happened before and that it was VRBOs fault. The response we got from VRBO is that she rented it on another app and didn’t block the time. Her response to my wife is “well - what do you want me to do about it?” 

We spent over an hour on the phone with VRBO. The result being that they could not get us in a house that day but they would find us a hotel for the night and look for a comparable house for the next day. We knew this would be difficult but we were hopeful. We didn’t hear from them again. When my wife called the next morning after being disconnected more than once she got a guy at VRBO named Marvin on the phone, who I later spoke to as well. Marvin was the most unprofessional, arrogant and nasty SOB I have ever had the displeasure of speaking to. My wife hates confrontation and would not raise her voice to anyone unless really pushed. Marvin called her “Karen” at one point and told us that nothing else would be done for us and we should have never been told they would look for another house because that was “never going to happen”. He later said to me “that’s not how this is going to work.” So while we could have been looking for other places to try to have our dinner and stay for the night we now find ourselves trying to get ready for graduation and find a place to stay and a place for dinner because we were lied to by the host and VRBO. 

As bad as all of this was for us one of the things that upsets us most is the host just gets away with it. Yes - my wife left a bad review. But it doesn’t seem like there is anything that happens to her. We will get our money back but it doesn’t fix what we went through and she gets to say “well what do you want me to do?” Then hangs up the phone and doesn’t have to give it another thought. 

We currently have a case open with VRBO but I am just wondering if anyone else has any insight on how to handle this situation. 

If you made it to the end. Thanks for reading.

Vrbo,A Tale of Two Totals: VRBO vs. Owner ,"Hi! So I recently posted about how my total cost of a 2-night stay came out to be $1,390.79 on VRBO. However, my credit card was charged $1,640.79. I wanted to know why there was a discrepancy of $250. So after going back and forth multiple times between VRBO and the rental’s actual property manager, I finally got an answer. Except it doesn’t really make sense. I’m including a screenshot of both the total from VRBO of $1,390.79 as well as the property manager’s invoice billed at $1,450.79. (The separate VRBO fee of $190 puts my grand total at $1,640.79.) 

When talking to the property manager, I explained to him that the VRBO app lists my total at $1,390.79 so I was surprised when I received my credit card statement with the additional $250. He said that his billing system recorded the price of my stay at $1,450.79 and it has happened to a few other clients who have booked his property with VRBO before. I asked for a copy of his invoice so that my credit card statement and the receipt would match up. When looking at his invoice, the $250 comes from a guest registration fee. I don’t feel it’s fair I have to pay this as it is not included anywhere in the original listing or even on the VRBO’s total. Can an owner just tack on $250? Or is VRBO at fault for not including this $250 guest registration fee? 

I’m just confused as to how the owner and VRBO are allowed to list two different final costs. At the end of the day, does VRBO or the owner/property manager have the final say? It doesn’t make sense. If anyone could help me understand, I’d greatly appreciate it! ",77,25,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ecvja0,2024-07-26 18:38:59,Vrbo

Vrbo,VRBO - Do Not Use!,"The rental property I booked was advertised and confirmed by the host as being wheelchair accessible. Specifically, the property was supposed to feature:

1. **Wheelchair Accessible Entry:** Doorways with a minimum width of 32 inches.
2. **Accessible Bathroom Facilities:** A shower and toilet that could be used by a wheelchair user without barriers.
3. **Accessible Living Areas:** Spaces that would allow for easy movement within the property for a wheelchair user.

Before finalizing the booking, I contacted the host directly to confirm these features, and they assured me that the property met all necessary accessibility standards.

However, upon arrival on 8/29/2024 it became immediately apparent that the property did not meet the advertised or confirmed accessibility standards. The doorways were too narrow to accommodate a wheelchair, and the bathroom facilities were not accessible, making it impossible for me to use the property as intended. Due to these deficiencies, the property was not usable, and I had to seek alternative accommodations, causing significant inconvenience and additional expense.    

In addition. I left a 1 star review and VRBO suppressed the review to show 5 stars for this location. I would avoid this company if at all possible.",40,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1f9sl1n/vrbo_do_not_use/,2024-09-05 17:45:21,Vrbo

Vrbo,"VRBO Awful Experience with Uncleaned House, Ghosted by Owner, and No Refund","I made a reservation with VRBO and when my family and I arrived there, the place was not cleaned in days. The pictures show the beds were not made, poop in the toilet, dirty dishes and other awful things. It scared my kids and was an awful experience to say the least as it was late Sunday night and we had no place to stay the night for a family of six adults and four children. 

I called VRBO right away and they gave me a case number. They did not offer any other help other than say to call the owner of the house, which I did. He apologized and said he would give me a full refund. I waited 3 or so weeks and no refund so I called VRBO. They said there is nothing they can do without the owner approving a refund even though they received the pictures. The owner would not respond to phone calls or txt, but I did eventually receive a  message using VRBO’s message system with the owner saying “We've processed your refund. It might take up to 15 days for this refund to reflect in your original form of payment. Please contact your bank for further updates.” The owner did also txt me later saying “We’ve processed your refund.”

Yet still no refund after a month. I called VRBO once again and they told me over the phone that a “full refund” was issued. I never received the full refund. I did receive a partial refund for VRBO processing fees, but not the full refund. I called VRBO many many times and they keep saying there is nothing they can do. VRBO refuses to send the full refund despiste:

* The pictures and proof that I did not get a cleaned place like advertised.
* The owner of the property telling me he will give me a full refund over the phone
* The owner of the property texting me “We’ve processed your refund.”
* The owner messaging me through VRBO messaging system saying “We've processed your refund.”

I’ve called VRBO many times to no avail. I filed a dispute with American Express and they have been horrendous. I’ve been an AE customer for over 20 years and never filed a dispute. AE would just cancel my dispute and side with VRBO without any contact to me first. I asked to talk to the dispute team and they wouldn’t let me. AE kept saying I got a refund, but I kept telling them it was only partial. I clearly didn’t get the services I paid for and was promised, so still not sure what AE is thinking. I reopened the dispute 4 times and each time it closed with just an email to me saying it was closed.

The owner has ghosted me and won’t respond. Every time I call VRBO they say they can’t do anything without the owner. Yet VRBO still has the house listed for other people to get scammed like I was.

I’ve been going through this since August and it's just an awful experience. So I’m here to ask what my next steps should be. Should I file in small claims court? I’m just not sure what to do next. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Vrbo,Vrbo scam? Or double booked? ,"My husband and I booked a 6500 sq Ft home on Vrbo for a group of 10. We traveled 7.5 hours and when we arrived we noticed all the lights were on and there were at least 8+ cars parked outside. When my husband went up to the door, the girl who was there stated they had booked that home and there was a ton of people there. She showed him the booking number and email, and said when she arrived she never got a check in code so she called the host and he gave her the code. So we called the host and told him the name it was under and that there are people there and it was double booked to which he replied “How is that even possible?!” Apparently he gave the code to her thinking it was our reservation but he didn’t confirm the reservation before giving her the code. So we call Vrbo (evolve) who says they only have our reservation and ask to talk to the other person who was in the house. She gives them her booking number and they say they don’t have that booking number and it is not even a booking number they would use. So she tells them they have to vacate the premises. The host says he’s on the way down to help get it figured out but then later says he was never coming down to where the home was and he had a flight in the morning? He then tells vrbo he doesn’t want anyone staying there and leaves at least 25+ people with no where to go. No other vrbos and no hotels available due to a big football game.

It’s been two weeks. I emailed the host again asking what was up, no reply, and after chatting with VRBO again today, it is still not resolved. Has anyone had any luck getting a chargeback? 

The VRBO agent said a “specialized team” would be in touch with me. 

This is the second time I’ve used VRBO and the LAST. Does anyone have any advice? At the moment, the reservation is still active.",35,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1cbkyrh/host_told_me_to_cancel_if_i_cancel_i_get_no/,2024-04-24 00:41:29,Vrbo
Vrbo,Learned how VRBO works from reading your posts - THANK YOU!,"I just wanted to express my gratitude for everyone posting in this group. 

  
Lessons Learned:

* If the host wants to cancel, don't let the host talk you into cancelling (even if there is no penalty for you). The host gets hit with a cancellation fee if they initiate the cancellation - [https://help.vrbo.com/articles/Partner-Cancellation-Fee-Policy](https://help.vrbo.com/articles/Partner-Cancellation-Fee-Policy)
* Once you agree to any changes outside of VRBO, what little protection you get from VRBO is null and void. Scam hosts will bait and switch your location and you will be SOL. 
* Communicate via the VRBO platform. Hosts are measured on how fast they respond to each message.

This week, I received an email (direct email, not a message through the VRBO platform) from Grand Welcome management company that my VRBO was ""no longer available"" with links to Grand Welcome's website of comparable properties at 50% higher rates.

I can completely understand the joys of capitalism; they booked my VRBO at a rate that was too low and now they need to cancel. But that's not my problem. I made this reservation over a month ago. 

I immediately messaged through the VRBO platform to say, ""Hey I just got a direct email from email address. If my reservation cannot be fulfilled, please cancel through VRBO so that I can receive a full refund."" 

The host responded, ""We are coordinating your request to our management team and we'll revert back once we hear back from them."" - This response doesn't tell me anything, just a response to satisfy the VRBO metric. For every ""non-response"" I would write back asking a question, ""What do you mean by revert back?"" 

I guess they got tired of me messaging them and cancelled my reservation through VRBO.",130,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1etr4jf/learned_how_vrbo_works_from_reading_your_posts/,2024-08-16 15:03:15,Vrbo
Vrbo,I messed up…,"Hello everyone, I was in a rush to book our trip up north in Michigan and I booked a place that looked nice without reading the whole description. Turns out that they only allow married couples or individuals to stay at the property due to their Christian beliefs and they offer no refunds. I have a fiancé so we aren’t officially married yet and my fiancé and I struggle with the morality of lying to the owners about our marital status so we won’t be doing that. Am I just out over $700 or is there anything I can do? I understand I messed up by not reading the description or the cancellation policy. Is this discrimination or does that not apply anymore since I confirmed the booking? Just looking for advice.  

Update: I asked the hosts for a refund and they gave me a refund. I know that’s very anti-climatic but I’m happy with my decision. ",737,546,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1dt73rj/i_messed_up/,2024-07-01 23:16:51,Vrbo
Vrbo,New to VRBO bad experience question.,"I rented a cabin for 2 nights for my girlfriend’s birthday. Check in was at 4:00, we arrived Friday around 4:15. When we walked into the cabin there were thousands of dead bugs throughout the cabin. Piles of them. They were on every surface in the cabin. The couches, the counters, the beds, upstairs and downstairs… you could not walk without stepping on them. 

I immediately messaged the host, as well as called the number he listed for any issues. On the phone call he was nonchalant and said he would call his cleaning person and let me know what was going on. 

After an hour of not hearing anything, I messaged him again because we were just stand around not knowing what to do. We didn’t want to bring in our luggage and food (which we planned on cooking that night) because there was no surface void of dead bugs. 

He responded at that point saying the cleaning lady was on her way with no ETA provided. We decided the best option was to try and find some dinner elsewhere since we couldn’t bring any into the cabin. 

We had to drive about 45 minutes to find a place that served food. We sat around waiting for an update on the cleaning situation (cell phone service was spotty at best). We decided to head back to the cabin around 9:00 since never got an update from the host. 

When we got back to the cabin we could see that the bugs were gone for the most part. There were still bugs in the couches and window sills and what not. All the surfaces like counter tops had dead bug residue still present so we had to clean and sanitize all the kitchen and dining room surfaces as well as wash the linens on the beds (because they had obviously not been changed even though the entire bed had been covered in dead bugs.

Our entire first night plans were upended. We were not able to cook the romantic birthday dinner we had brought or enjoy the cabin at all the first night since we had to clean once we got back and unpacked. 

After all of this we have not heard back from the host. Not even to verify if the situation was taken care of.

Is it unreasonable to ask for some sort of refund given these circumstances/inconveniences we were put through? If so what would be fair? One night off, no cleaning/host fee, or both?

Vrbo,Is this VRBO a scam? ,"We just booked a venue via VRBO for four days for a micro wedding. My future FIL mentioned he heard about VRBO scams, so we started researching more. Now,  I’m nervous it’s a scam. The date is a year out. 

Here are the items we verified:
- location looks accurate from google 
- there was 1 review
- the company had a prior listing, which I can no longer access, that had 9 reviews stating the prior listing was nice but had some inaccuracies (e.g., counting rooms as bedrooms) 
- I DM’d the host to ask for prior approval for a micro wedding, per their listing instructions. They responded that I could host the event, but would need to capture the full amount of guests that would be invited. 
- in our DM’s, he said I could put a temporary guest count (e.g., 12) and increase to the actual count once I get RSVP’s since it will also help alleviate the upfront cost. I feel like this is opposite of what a scammer would say, but maybe I’m reading into it. 
- there was a contract that I had to sign that said I wouldn’t allow anymore than the max amount of guests, release for any injuries, no refunds for non working appliances such as hot tubs, etc. based on my research, this seems to be normal for hosts and too much work for a scammer. 
- all payments were via VRBO
- there was a similar listing in the next town over for a similar price, which people used for weddings (I found their wedding websites). So it tells me the price, although seems to be too good to be true, may be accurate. 

Here are the items that concern me
- the house is on Zillow for sale and has been on the market since 3/2024
- the VRBO photos are definitely from the Zillow listing
- the VRBO listing is new with 1 review
- I’m not able to find the company online/linkedin
- the company email for the host (for the contract) is @gmail as opposed to @[company name]
- I can’t find a way to see any of the host’s other listings nor a profile. 
- the prices are affordable for 2025, but skyrocket for 2026. I’m concerned this is a tactic to get the VRBO money sooner. 


My fiancé messaged the Zillow listing agent to verify that the owners are renting, or, if not, to let them know someone is using their property as a scam. I am slightly spiraling. Are there any other ways that you’ve been able to determine if a listing is a scam?? ",1,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1g9z1l9/is_this_vrbo_a_scam/,2024-10-23 01:44:00,Vrbo
Vrbo,Screwed by Vrbo,"My husband gifted me a family trip to the white mountains. He booked a resort property (several of the units are privately owned) through Vrbo for 4 nights several months ago. He received the confirmation with check in information 2 days in advance. His card was charged ahead of time for the full price through Vrbo.

When we arrived, the property had no record of us, and they were completely booked, since it’s vacation week. The host first tried to say he didn’t “see anything come through” related to the booking, even though we had paid in full and had a confirmation.  Vrbo supposedly has a guarantee that they’ll make it right if this sort of thing happens, but they had no comprable properties and left us(plus our 3 kids) with nothing. It took hours to even come up with a back up plan. Luckily the property we had planned to stay at helped us out and made a ton of calls. We got the last available room at a budget motel with 5 of us squeezed into one room, instead of the 2 br condo we had planned for. The “budget” motel is also crazy expensive because of school vacation week and we never would have paid this kind of money to stay in a place like this (they’ve been very kind, it just wasn’t what we were planning). 

So far Vrbo has refunded $150, less than 10% of the initial cost. Also we had planed to cook most of our meals, but now we are stuck going out to eat more because we don’t have the kitchen we planned for. I think they should refund what we paid to them and also pay for some of our additional incurred expenses.  They have a policy that says they do this, but it already feels like they are trying to weasel out of their responsibility. Is this unreasonable? Has anyone had success going up against Vrbo?

Vrbo,New VRBO Entry Access Policy,"I just received an email from VRBO stating that Jan 1, 2025, they are implementing a new policy for guests to receive critical access information such as keypad codes at least 72 hours prior to check-in.

  
I provide this information 24 hours prior to check-in, or, if I have a same day turnover, the morning of. Not a single guest has ever complained. One week prior to check-in, I inform them of the timelines and expectations and so on.

I might be dropping VRBO if this is enforced. I don't have a remote keypad lock because it sucks up batteries way too fast with wifi so the code is changes when the cleaner is on-site.

Vrbo,Red flags on VRBO?,"So there are a few red flags with this VRBO listing that is getting confusing for me....

I'm new to using VRBO. I booked a home for a large party through VRBO and was planning on paying in 2 payments. There are no reviews on this listing, however the host is a ""Premier Host."" Then I received a message from the host saying that it was not possible to process my payment with my credit card for booking. They then sent me a ""lodgify"" link for payment. Because I was feeling sus, I searched the address online and found that it was a property that is on the market currently.

I first called the real estate agent on the listing. He verified that it is an active Airbnb listing and the name of the property manager is his client.

Then I called VRBO to try and 1) verify if this listing has had people book in the past and 2) if it was shady to get links to third party sites.

The agent told me that this is actually a legit way for property managers to receive payment because VRBO will take the booking fee but the rest may need to be done on their third party site. The property manager gave me his website information ([https://www.sunnysidegetaways.com/](https://www.sunnysidegetaways.com/)) and his personal phone number through VRBO messaging. But when I asked for a phone call, he asked to keep all messages on the secure VRBO messaging app.

So it seems like there are some red flags that have legitimate answers for them? But I'm still feeling iffy about the third party payment and not sure what to make of his website and not wanting to call me.

Vrbo,A few questions for my first potential time booking on VRBO,"Hi everyone.  Just looking for your thoughts, as this is my first time considering VRBO.

How would you say their customer support is vs Airbnb?  I've found Airbnb to be pretty bad, insofar as you typically cannot get a live person for customer support.  Does VRBO seem to have the backs of paying guests, and making sure they are not being 'scammed'...that the listings are genuine...that once we arrive, the home will be as the host said it would be...as the photos have shown?

I'm going to be spending 2.5 months in Tokyo, and so once I arrive, I need to know that I will be set with my short-term accommodations.  Price, and location, are naturally a factor for me, and I found one place that seems to fit the bill.  However, while the listing looks nice, the host has no reviews, nor does the 'About the Host' say or show anything about them (beyond their name).  This automatically raises a bit of concern.  I'd obviously prefer to see reviews and a bit of info about the host.

I did write them asking a question or two about their property (and for the particular dates I want to stay), and while they answered my questions, not long after that I received an email through the VRBO system that says 'Payment request.  Your rental payment of $XXXXX is due on May 20, 2024 (i.e., today)'.   Now granted, maybe that was an automated email....maybe just the host's way of showing me what the total cost would be....but that too set off a bit of an alarm... that at this point we are simply 'discussing' the rental...that I was asking questions...and that I already see a bill asking for immediate payment.  

I always have my 'potential scam' armor on, so maybe I'm worrying too much....but anyway, I'm curious what others think...what their experiences have been with VRBO... how well VRBO vets their hosts.....how much of a risk I may be taking with a host who has no reviews or info about themselves...and if anyone out there has experience with their host not coming through on their end of the bargain, but that in the end, VRBO took care of the guests, refunding any monies lost and/or finding them other suitable accommodations.

Vrbo,Warning: Dealing with Scammers on VRBO – Terrible Experience with Host Harassment,"I wanted to share my frustrating and alarming experience with VRBO, in hopes of warning others about the growing number of scammers and unprofessional hosts on the platform.

Several weeks ago, I booked a villa through VRBO. After the booking, I had no communication from the host at all. I reached out multiple times, both through VRBO and even called customer service, but I was completely ignored. Weeks went by with no response, so I escalated the issue and eventually managed to get through to VRBO's chat support. After a lengthy conversation, they finally cancelled the booking for me.

However, this is where things took a dark turn. Just 6 HOURS after the cancellation, the host started harassing me. I received a series of messages where the host called me names, insulted me, and even made incredibly inappropriate comments, calling me a ""homosexual"" and telling me if I was ""a real man"" I should come and find him. It was disturbing and completely uncalled for.

I’m honestly shocked that VRBO would allow hosts like this to be on their platform. I’ve always thought of VRBO as a reputable service, but this experience has completely soured my opinion. I would strongly advise anyone to stay away from not just VRBO, but also related sites like Expedia and Fewo Direkt. I never imagined I’d deal with such unprofessionalism and harassment, and I’m just lucky I was able to get my booking canceled before it escalated further.

Please be cautious if you’re booking through these platforms. The lack of accountability and support in situations like mine is concerning, and I would hate for anyone else to go through something like this.

**TL;DR:** Booked a villa on VRBO, host ignored me for weeks. After canceling through VRBO, the host harassed me, calling me names and making inappropriate comments.

I spent all day on the phone with Vrbo support and eventually got someone to book me 2 nights in an emergency hotel. Now, those 2 nights are up, and I have no place to stay for the remaining 4 nights.

Since then, Vrbo has done nothing. Every time I call, I’m put on hold endlessly. Now I’m literally on the street with nowhere to stay as my hotel booking is over.

One agent suggested I extend the hotel myself, pay upfront, and submit a claim for reimbursement—but I have no idea how to do that or who to submit it to. Plus, hotel prices have jumped to $500/night (my original booking was $100/night), and there’s no guarantee I’ll even get reimbursed. I’m also racking up huge phone bills, spending my vacation dealing with this instead of relaxing by the pool or beach.

Vrbo,Well that was my last VRBO booking,"Booked a last minute Christmas trip with my sons to hit our favorite little ski area, because they were about to get blasted with snow.   As a 54 year old desk jockey, 3 days of snowboarding is rough on the body.   So I splurged for the holidays, and booked something way bigger and pricier than I needed, because it had a large private hot tub on the deck.

Arrived Friday night to find al alert on the control panel saying the heater was disabled, and the tub was too cold to use.   I called Vacasa about this, and was informed that there was a maintenance ticket put in for the hot tub 3 days BEFORE I booked.  Maintenance had ordered a replacement part, but had managed to get it working again.

So the local maintenance guy came out the next day and managed to get it working again.   We got a soak in ( a little cooler than I'd like), and then it flaked out again.   So we couldn't soak later that night, or the next morning.   Maintenance returned and tried again, and we got 1 more semi-hot soak before it conked out for the last 2 days.

I've now been going back and forth on the phone and texts with VRBO for the last 12 days.  I feel I'm fully in the right to expect some sort of refund, since both the host and VRBO knew that main amenity of the property was dysfunctional, and they booked it anyway.   I would not have booked it with that knowledge, and it was a serious damper on the trip.

If I keep getting the runaround from them, what is the best next step to take?   I don't do this very often, so am out of my element a little.

Thanks for the feedback and letting me vent.  Okay, it's Vacasa, not VRBO, fair enough.   Dispute filed with credit card today.   Hopefully it will just work out now, because I have a family emergency to attend to, and this just dropped off my radar.",117,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/18yz07k/well_that_was_my_last_vrbo_booking/,2024-01-05 05:24:48,Vrbo

Low and behold, he won't return my refund and told me to screw off on the chat.

They looked for more rooms and when they couldn't find any they were simply like ""sorry buddy we can't find any.""

I got a refund, but the trip is now a mess. I booked a room for other people. Their trip is a mess. Other people on the trip booked elsewhere and are going to be without a big portion of the group unless we find something else.

Vrbo,"Piling on, do not book with VRBO!","On a family trip to Ireland (all of us adults), my mom ended up booking all the accomodations, mostly through the VRBO app. I'd never used VRBO, probably wouldn't have been my choice, but there we were. We moved around quite a bit,  and the very first night things started going wrong. 

With no check-in information by the time we landed, it was a struggle to get ahold of the first host. Once they finally answered they became more responsive and we eventually got into the place, but it left me feeling a little nervous about the rest of these bookings. We were high and dry in a foreign city for a few hours.

Subsequently, we got cancelled on as we were boarding a train to Belfast, at check-in time. ""Flood damage"" was the excuse, and the host became unresponsive to calls or messages. But at least it got refunded. Problem was, we had two separate stays booked with him. Guess what never got refunded, and who stopped responding to messages?

Finally, almost the exact same situation happened on the way home. We got sent on a scavenger hunt through Dublin, where apparently a local convenience store was holding the key. Surprise, surprise, they didn't have it, and the host similarly became unresponsive when asked to cancel and refund the stay. 

Long story short, stick to hotels, especially for international travel. This whole thing had my aging mother crying multiple times, and us scrambling to find alternatives at the last minute.

I looked at past reviews for this property and others have complained about the lack of pool maintenance. It seems like they have been aware that the pool is unusable and are still renting it out in this condition to people while advertising a place with a nice pool. They will absolutely not budge and give us a bigger refund, nor will they let us cancel and refund the rest of our stay so that we can go elsewhere. I called VRBO and the best that they will do is pay 50% of what we originally paid toward another rental. The whole reason we chose this rental is because of the pool.

Its now around 2 months ago, i have called VRBO multiple times, trying to get an update.

Last time i called they called the host, who said that he also lost money and would like to meet on the middle. I of course didn't entertain this idea, and told VRBO that i still need the full refund.

Vrbo,Long time VRBO owner and traveler considering closing account ,"I've literally been on VRBO for over 20 years. First I was an owner with a ski condo in Breckenridge, Colorado. All of my experiences were good. I sold the condo and became a renter. Things have steadily gone down hill. 

Owners, tell me if these things can be avoided/fixed and I might try booking again. Right now, after talking to a condescending British man on the customer service line, I'm close to done. 

(1) How do I get the filters to work? I set my price at $1000/night and the site still shows me properties up to $7000/night. Uh, no, you're not going to tempt me to spend more.

(2) I selected 2 bedrooms but the site keeps showing me studios and one bedrooms. Yes, there are 2 bedrooms available, so it isn't an inventory issue.

(3) Why can't we get at least the cross streets for properties? Tonight every listing had a gigantic black circle covering its location on the map. We used to be able to zoom in on the exact building. This is really important for skiing. Nobody wants to have to walk half a mile in ski boots. From experience, I don't go by the descriptions in the listings. There are property managers that will claim a rental is ski in/out when it really isn't. I need to be able zoom in on the map to see exactly how I would get to the lift or bus.

(4) Why don't the property managers fix the things the previous renters said are bad? A mattress for example. If three previous renters wrote reviews saying the mattress is sagging, then the owner should replace it IMO. I did when I was an owner. And, oh, the useless politician remarks from the property managers. Those are infuriating. 

(5) Is there a way to filter out property management companies that you have already had bad experiences with? I despise Vacasa and will never again stay at a property managed by them. I know I probably have to just keep scrolling to the bottom of every listing. Just hoping there is a better way.

Vrbo,"Vrbo had bedbugs - received no compensation, review didn't post, Vrbo didn't care to take action, and new guests continue staying there at risk of exposure","**TLDR**: I was bit by bedbugs at a Vrbo and have photo evidence of bed infestation; host denied it, my review didn't get posted, and Vrbo has been unresponsive to this urgent issue. New guests continue to stay on that property at risk; simply zero regard for consumer protection. It's absolutely criminal. PLEASE always check for bedbugs before you sleep on a Vrbo mattress.

**Full context**:

Stayed in Vrbo for 3 nights. Woke up itchy on day 1 but didn't recognize the bedbug connection until checkout, when I removed the fitted sheet and found textbook bedbug stains underneath: clustered dots that look like felt pen ink stains that smear when rubbed. Absolutely unmistakable. The bites were in a linear pattern - also unmistakably due to bedbugs.

Reported it to the host, but he denied any signs of bedbugs and refused to provide any form of compensation.  He continued to rent it out to guests without any concern for continued bedbug exposure/transmission.

Since this was an obvious safety hazard, I then reported it to Vrbo, but they claimed they were unable to provide any compensation and seemed *totally unconcerned* - even after providing clear photo evidence of the bedbug fecal stains and bites. **It wasn't until** **I explicitly asked** ""don't you care at all that other guests are at risk?"" that they hesitated and agreed to escalate this to the ""specialized team"". But it has been a full 4 days later with no response and I'm sure new guests continue to stay there at risk.

Meanwhile I've unwittingly transported bedbugs back home and am continuing to get bites - waking up to new welts each morning. It's become a psychological and financial nightmare. I've sunk several days researching bedbug containment (I literally took vacation days to deal with this), and have bought mattress protectors, bedpost interceptors, a steamer, and diatomaceous earth to try to eradicate them. I'm desperately hoping it doesn't get worse. It's unbelievable that Vrbo refused to provide any compensation for this horror show; any hotel would have instantly provided a full refund after guests experienced bedbug exposure.

I obviously **tried to post an honest review** of my experience, but it was **blocked for unknown reasons**, so there is truly no way for me to warn future guests about this issue. I just hope this post helps someone else recognize bedbug signs so they don't fall victim as well.

[Bedbug fecal stains. They poop digested blood. It's dark brown and smears when rubbed. They're clustered because bedbugs like to hang out and digest together. Horror is an appropriate reaction when you see this on Vrbo bedding.](https://preview.redd.it/jy133o1y6qjd1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b21c79fa97e0f734b4d6dd6aa383b9b66a0f246)

Vrbo,Bad Experience with Vrbo (Seeking advice),"Had a stay that was going okay in Brienz, Switzerland. The place was just as described, so no disappointment there. Everything fell apart at the end of the stay.

What happened is the host just unlocked the door and came inside. after a few of us had left the house Without any warning. No message, not even a knock. They acted completely oblivious that anyone was in the house, as they tried to just proceed to the upstairs where all our bedrooms where. It wasn't until my sister in law who was sitting right in sight of the door stopped them halfway up the stairs. Apparently a neighbor reported they saw people smoking ""5 minutes ago"" inside. The host aggressively accused and then continued to go through our things on the bottom floor looking for evidence or a smell. The host then admitted (these are their exact words), ""well I don't smell anything."" They left with no apology. Nobody on the trip smokes. We later found discarded cigarette butts on the front steps of the tiny alley, next to the recently occupied vacation rental.

Needless to say Vrbo was contacted immediately. COMPLETELY useless. Got pretty much nowhere after 4 disconnects and 6 hours on hold. They offered no help. Not even accommodations. Vrbo's own admission was it broke their Terms and Conditions for both host and guest. No refund offered. Nothing. They opened a ""case.""  What I find worse, the host is still listed and hosting. I have since disputed the charge with my card, hoping something might happen. This was the first time ever using Vrbo.

Vrbo,Warning: Dealing with Scammers on VRBO – Terrible Experience with Host Harassment,"I wanted to share my frustrating and alarming experience with VRBO, in hopes of warning others about the growing number of scammers and unprofessional hosts on the platform.

Several weeks ago, I booked a villa through VRBO. After the booking, I had no communication from the host at all. I reached out multiple times, both through VRBO and even called customer service, but I was completely ignored. Weeks went by with no response, so I escalated the issue and eventually managed to get through to VRBO's chat support. After a lengthy conversation, they finally cancelled the booking for me.

However, this is where things took a dark turn. Just 6 HOURS after the cancellation, the host started harassing me. I received a series of messages where the host called me names, insulted me, and even made incredibly inappropriate comments, calling me a ""homosexual"" and telling me if I was ""a real man"" I should come and find him. It was disturbing and completely uncalled for.

I’m honestly shocked that VRBO would allow hosts like this to be on their platform. I’ve always thought of VRBO as a reputable service, but this experience has completely soured my opinion. I would strongly advise anyone to stay away from not just VRBO, but also related sites like Expedia and Fewo Direkt. I never imagined I’d deal with such unprofessionalism and harassment, and I’m just lucky I was able to get my booking canceled before it escalated further.

Please be cautious if you’re booking through these platforms. The lack of accountability and support in situations like mine is concerning, and I would hate for anyone else to go through something like this.

Vrbo,"Promised a 50% Refund and never got it, VRBO is no help, do I chargeback?","Hi folks,

For context I stayed at a large property a couple of months ago, and all communications with the host was done via the VRBO app. It was a very expensive location, the total was in excess of $7000.

Less than an hour after booking the host had informed me they would be working on the stucco during our stay and offered to move our booking or give us a 25% refund if we stayed. Since we weren't flexible on dates we told them we would stay for the 25% refund. There was no mention of the pool being closed and that workers would be entering the home as they pleased. Then halfway thru our stay the power went out and we had a lot of food that went bad, and the host promised another 25% refund for a total of 50%.

I've opened multiple tickets with VRBO support, and they keep saying it was been ""escalated"" but nothing ever comes out of this. I'm very frustrated and I am thinking about issuing a chargeback with the credit card company. Does anyone have any similar experiences as a renter or host, or any advice for me?

Vrbo,"Selling my VRBO/Airbnb business with 8 properties, ADVICE?","My husband and I have a small but very successful Short Term Rental business in Louisville, Kentucky, Built over the last 15 years, we have 8 pieces of real estate, all within walking distance of our primary residence, in the most sought after area of the city for short term rentals. 5 are commercially zones condos, the other 3 are larger homes with very hard to get CUPs (conditional use permits) for STR use. It is now impossible to get a CUP in the neighborhood these houses are in. Listed on Airbnb and Vrbo with superhost/premier host status, fantastic reviews and many returning guests that book directly. Our rents last year were 650k and we have about 225k on the books in future bookings.

We are ready to retire and cash out. And, we are exploring selling the entire package- all is held within a single LLC. The CUPs and permits would transfer to the new owner. We are willing to include our actual Airbnb account in the sale. Vrbo allows the transfer the reviews with proof of address (though I don't think Premier Host is transferable). We would credit the deposits we have for future direct bookings to the purchase price.

We want to sell the whole LLC both for the ease of a single transaction and because we would benefit tax wise by having the profit be capital gains rather than ordinary income. The purchaser would benefit from the property taxes not being immediately increased as they are in a straight real estate sale.

Here are my questions:

Have you, either as a buyer or seller, ever done a transaction like this. That is, that is the purchase or sale of an LLC containing real estate, future bookings, permits, etc.? If so, how did it go? Would you do it again? What was the down side, if any?

Vrbo,VRBO showing multiple months next year as unbookable despite settings allowing booking an unlimited number of months ahead of time? ,"I'm a property manager for two short term rentals in the same area. I got a booking inquiry earlier today from a family who had stayed with us in the past and really wanted to book a stay next summer but apparently everything was already booked. I was completely taken aback because we've never sold out more than the odd week or so this far in advance, let alone multiple months in the summer. I go to check and realize that it's displaying as booked or blocked through airbnb. That checks out because usually if there is an issue with the calendar, it is Airbnb's fault. So I go to Airbnb and see that like 6 months next year are set to be blocked despite allowing up to 2 years advance booking on Airbnb. I manually unblock everything to fix the issue and it seems to work but then I refresh the calendar on vrbo and now everything is just ""unbookable"" for some reason. When I select the dates to try and unblock them it doesn't even give a reason for them being unbookable, or even display that they are blocked at all. I'm planning on calling VRBO support later today but does anyone know what may have caused this? Some setting that I've overlooked?

Vrbo,VRBO customer support lies about reimbursements,"We had a booking last month that turned out to be a scam listing. We were never given any information about checking in and a few days before our reservation was supposed to begin, 2 reviews were posted on the listing saying the same thing, that they were never able to check in and their money was taken - listing was a scam. We were stuck without anywhere to go in a busy place with little available (big event going on in town and we needed pet friendly). VRBO support tells us they will cancel the booking and provide a refund, and for our troubles, we should self book a hotel and that would be fully reimbursed. I asked if there was a $ limit on the hotel as we needed to book same day and rates had rocketed. They said no -- whatever we spend will be reimbursed. We made sure they emailed us that in writing too, which he did. We got one of the cheaper places we could (didn't want to abuse the system) but it was still 3x more expensive than our original reservation. 

  
Got the reimbursement for the original scam booking immediately. It's been a month of calling repeatedly to get our hotel reimbursed. Now they're saying they will only reimburse 1/3 of the cost of the hotel (the amount of the original scam booking) DESPITE us having it in writing from VRBO that the hotel will be reimbursed. They're saying now that that is the Book with Confidence rules, even though no one ever mentioned this was going to be falling under the book with confidence guarantee, just that it would be reimbursed.

  
Surely this can't be right...that we follow instructions, which we have in writing, from VRBO, and we end up over $1000 out of pocket?

Vrbo,Beach House from Hell,"We planned a trip celebrating two birthdays and decided not to eat out at all. We planned nightly meals and brought about $750 of food to cook every night.

After the first night, we realized the refrigerator was broken, so all of our food was going to spoil. Great, we are now trying to save all of our food (feeding 10 people) by buying huge bags of ice to stick in the fridge. The next day (today) someone finally came out to tell us what we already knew “the refrigerator is broken”.

Tonight, the kitchen sink backed up while we were preparing to do dishes. I took it upon myself to scoop all the water out and check the p-trap, all clear - major plumbing blockage. We can’t wash dishes, clean pots/pans, silverware, or glasses. The kitchen is now useless.

On top of all of that, we chose this place because the pictures showed numerous beautiful beach views from the deck. Upon arrival we found the sand dune has been raised about 15 feet (and has been this way for years), so you can’t even see the beach now. This especially sucks, because we have a totally disabled special needs child with us that requires 24/7 care (another reason why we decided not to eat out) and can’t go out on the beach.

I tried calling (and texted)  the 2 listed property managers to report the plumbing backup (no answers) and messaged the host through the app (no answer). The rest of the house is in need of major attention as well. Doors barely open/close, bedroom doors not latching, ceiling fans not working, etc. 

I am not very familiar with Vrbo policies. I am also a host (99% Airbnb), and mind-blown at the level of neglect and misrepresentation for this listing.  How should I handle this?",1679,249,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/17b7c9y/beach_house_from_hell/,2023-10-19 01:38:21,Vrbo

Vrbo,Book with confidence when you dont rebook with VRBO or a hotel,"How does this work? We booked a stay for 4 nights in Florence Italy on VRBO. Got to the location, and it was literally underconstruction. The staircase was being replastered, there was dust and dirt everywhere. We got there later in the day, so the workmen had all left and host assured us they wouldnt be noisy before 9am. Well that turned out to be false, they were working at 7am.   
  
We called VRBO and asked to cancel the rest of the stay and move elsewhere. I couldnt find anything we liked on VRBO so I went to AirBnB and found a place and we took it. VRBO did agree that the stay did meet the requirements under their book with confidence guarantee, but they said it needs to be through VRBO, expedia,  or a hotel. Does this invalidate the book with confidence refund? We only stayed aproximately 12-14 hours in the VRBO unit before leaving. All I am looking for is the 3 unused nights being refunded.

Vrbo,Vrbo Cancellation Fee—Need Advice on What to Do,"Hi everyone, hope all is well!

I recently received an invoice from Vrbo with a cancellation fee for almost $3,000. Here's the situation: A guest made a 40-day instant booking on an account where I hadn't received any bookings for over a year. Since there was construction going on at the property, I called Vrbo, explained the situation, and they told me they could cancel the reservation. I agreed, thinking that would be the end of it.

However, yesterday I received an invoice for nearly $3,000, even though I wasn’t the one who canceled the reservation—the cancellation was done by one of Vrbo’s workers over the phone. I was never informed about any cancellation fees or charges at the time.

Even if I wanted to pay, I honestly don’t have the money to cover a $3,000 charge, especially since I haven’t made any income through Vrbo. I’m really unsure about what to do next.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? If I don’t pay, will I just get banned from Vrbo, or could this lead to legal issues? I’d really appreciate any advice or suggestions.

Vrbo,VRBO Host Payments: How do they work?,"When a client pays the deposit money for the first part of the reservations, does the host get the funds immediately? Or is the deposit held by VRBO and not released until the entire reservation is complete?  
I'm asking because I'm not hearing anything from a host regarding a cancellation request. I am well within the conditions stipulated by the host (more than 2 months out) and the host has gone *radio silent.* I am mindful of each passing day, because if they don't respond and let this slip past the time requirement, then I lose both the deposit and possibly the whole amount, which amounts to thousands.  
So I'm wondering if the host has already spent the funds, hence unable to refund any money. Or if the whole listing is a giant scam. Purportedly, the host works as the property manager, for the owner.  
Also, I can't find a phone number for vrbo -is this simply a website, or is there a customer service agent behind this who helps both the customers and the owners/hosts? Or is vrbo simply an AI chatbot?

We get here at 8pm and close to 9 I realize the are no towels. I call the host. She tells me 'they' we're supposed to inform me to bring my own sheets and towels. No one notified me at all. I call Vrbo customer service. According to them, sheets and towels are not expected because they are not listed in the amenities.

I ran to Target before they closed and spent $162 on 2 linen sets and 3 towels for 3 people.

I have never considered sheets and towels as an amenity at any place I stayed. They're minimum fucking basic requirements. Consumables, sure. But might as well list every single piece of furniture in the amenities. And curtains and stairs and lampshades.

I need to call the host back tomorrow but I want to know if there are any rules, TOS sections, etc that might help my case here. I would not have booked this place if I knew I had to bring my own sheets and towels.

Vrbo,Is this a normal vrbo experience?,"I will try and keep this as short as possible.  Recently booked a cottage for myself, spouse and two children and here are the concerns I had with the experience:

-was told the listing had two bedrooms (1 with queen bed, 1 with two doubles) and a pull out couch in the living room.  Turns out there was only one double bed in the second bedroom

-tried to use the pull out couch and when we opened it there were nut shells, chew marks and dust all over the plastic cover, it was obvious a rodent had been living in it

-was promised the wifi password upon entering the cottage and the host could not figure it out.  My spouse reset the router and we used the factory password and had to pass that on to the host when he requested.  This took 5 hours of back and forth to communicate and he would only respond to texts even though I messaged in the app

-I was told I needed to bring sheets and towels (I asked specifically what I needed to bring), arrived to learn there were no blankets and only three pillows (listing said sleeps 5)

-no smaller amenities in the property like hand soap or dish soap 

-the property was generally a little dusty and had cobwebs like it was cleaned at one point but not recently.

-host did not respond at all to my concerns other than to say ""we will fix the website""

I left a decent review as the stay in general was fine and we were happy to make do with what we had.  I know reviews are important to hosts to I was trying to be diplomatic and at the end of the day I don't really care that much.  I followed up my review with a personal message to the host listing the above in a kind way stating my goal was to help improve the listing for future guests.  I even mentioned in the email that it was curious to me why he hadn't addressed my concerns on the first night when I mentioned them?  The response I got back from the ""host"" was to say ""thank you OP I will pass along your feedback to the owners.""  So apparently I was dealing with a property manager and the owners were likely not even seeing my messages as it was him I was dealing with booking through the app/texting.  Is this normal to use a PM?  Should there have been blankets and hand soap?  This is only my second stay through vrbo and I was genuinely confused about this whole experience and wondering if I'm in the wrong?

Vrbo,Another Warning About Horrible VRBO Customer Service,"Back in October 2023, I booked a large estate for 35 people in April 2024. The estate was on an island in the Caribbean, and I was in contact with the hosts for boat taxi transportation for weeks leading up to the trip. They were well aware of the group size.

Upon arrival, the estate had no running water of any kind, no AC as promised, no WiFi as promised, and the hosts lived on-site. Our only source of drinking water was bottled water that could be purchased from the hosts (which they ran out of within 2 hours). The hosts told us the water would be fixed in 24 hours... When the pump ship came around the next day. They'd forgotten to fill the reservoir tanks 🤯  I called VRBO customer service stressed the unhealthy situation we were in. I wanted help rebooking and for any extra costs of rebooking to be covered.

The agent stated they would open a case, but they weren't able to assist in rebooking our group. The agent called the hosts and they didn't pick up. The agent then emailed the hosts and told them our issues while we were on-site. The hosts confronted us and were pissed at us for not giving them time to fix the issues they could fix. Regardless, it was 100 degrees and it's not like the hosts can find AC units or help us rebook to a new place.

I had to rebook as many people as possible using Airbnb, hotels, and whatever else that was available. About 10 people still ended up staying at the original lodging due to no vacancy elsewhere. The hosts were onsite the whole time and clearly made us feel unwelcome now. My birthday party was totally altered.

After the trip ended, I called back VRBO and was told my complaint was closed because the host did not provide any comments on the situation. I was like ""so that should be a given that my side of the story is as described."" Instead, the agent said that only the host can give a refund and that VRBO can only reach back out to the host to pass on my complaints and ask for a refund. The agent said I'm only entitled to the amount of the original stay. Nothing for the extra amounts I spent on rebooking day-of.

Anyways, it's now been over two weeks of back and forth with Expedia Group / VRBO, seven different reps that I need to explain the situation to each time, the same protocol of VRBO reaching out to the host, never getting a response from the host, and then VRBO agent stating there is no method to escalate internally at VRBO to get a refund. FINALLY, I got an agent that said they could escalate internally for review, but that best case would be a refund for the original VRBO amount. No refunds for extra amounts on the day-of bookings. At this point, I've chalked it up to a lesson learned and to be happy with whatever I can get. Fingers crossed this internal escalation actually does something.

Vrbo,[HOST] VRBO Started Autogenerating Incorrect Information,"I've been a host on VRBO for the past 5 years. VRBO without notice started auto-creating content on my listing based on my location in the ""Explore the Area Section"". Both the description in ""About the Neighborhood"" and the  points of interest/distances in ""What's nearby"" seem to be AI generated.

As far as I can tell, I have no ability to change this information. I've had my first two non-five star ratings back to back based on this inaccurate information. VRBO support has told me this is the way the site is now and there's nothing I can do. This creates a poor guest experience since the area isn't as described.

Vrbo,Vrbo Technical Issue Won’t Accept my Payment,"Peace, I attempted to book a Vrbo yesterday 09/13/24 for same day (I asked the host prior to booking and she added yesterday manually to my reservation so I could start my stay immediately). She did and when I tried to pay for the stay I kept getting an error message. I called my back to make sure that wasn’t the issue and then called Vrbo.

They let me know there was a system wide issue that has been causing this same issue to occur with other guests. 

I was assured the problem would be fixed by tech support within 2 hours. It wasn’t. I called back again to see what Vrbo could do given that the issue was on their end. 

First the representative said they only provide help when a guest is stranded and it’s as a result of a failure on their part. After stating that that is in fact my situation, the representative said he could assist after confirming with the host that I was in fact supposed to check in that same day. After we finally did that, they both agreed I would be allowed to begin my stay while waiting for Vrbo’s system to be fixed. 

About 10 mins later, after giving my the check in instructions, the host went back on that agreement citing that it was because Vrbo’s polices. I ended up having to pay for a hotel. 

Later that night and the next morning 09/14 the issue is still not fixed. I got the same run around from another Vrbo representative and the host flat out canceled our reservation, likely because of the hassle with payment even though the representative himself told her it was due to no fact of my own.

I made the next decision to put a charge back order on my credit card to prevent me from incurring any fraudulent charges and sent an email to Vrbo explaining how I felt they were negligent in providing emergency information during a potentially fatal hurricane. 
The response I got is where I m confused and I’ll post below: could someone help me understand what they are saying and any advice about the charge back and where to go from here would be appreciated!

You will need to pay upfront and a reimbursement may be provided should it fulfill our Book with Confidence program. You may book new reservation up to $13,212.075 and we will reimburse you for the price difference between your cancelled reservation and new reservation up to $4,404.025.

Vrbo,Vrbo scam?,"So we have a trip coming up at the end of July, we booked a place on Vrbo for 8 days. Noticed the same listing on Airbb for 1000.00 more. so we booked Vrbo. 6 weeks later we get a email saying the host has to cancel our reservation due to the town has too many short term visitors. Isnt that what Airbb rentals are?  Anyway emailed the host back and he must have go us confused with Airbb, he said, your reservation for that week is confirmed.  I think we booked it and he left the listing up on Airbb, someone booked it at the 1000.00 higher price 6 weeks later and he canceled us. Naturally all the alternatives we had picked are booked now.

Vrbo,I feel scammed.,"I meticulously went through all of the VRBO listings for an upcoming trip to a highly recognized Medical Center for a complicated surgery.  We paid in full far in advance for a two story house with fireplaces, beautiful decor and a fenced in backyard for our dogs.  Our host sent us the door code when we were 2.5 hours away and said he was glad we would be there soon. 


With two hours notice, we get a call from a different person who “co-hosts” with the host I’m talking with who says the people in the house we rented aren’t leaving because she still hasn’t recovered from HER surgery.  The only remedy is to offer me an alternative home which is absolutely nowhere near the quality of what we rented.  (There is a reason it’s available and nobody booked it). He actually “offered” me a choice of two lesser value rentals, one worse than the other. He keeps describing it as one of his Air B&B properties but it’s right there on VRBO. All 3 are on VRBO. I remember seeing them. I have double checked and they are all there.  
I have no choice but to stay in the new place.  I have surgery in the morning and they waited until the last minute for the bait and switch so I can’t find anything else at 2pm, day of, with 2 dogs and no refund.  He says he will give me a “discount”. The lesser property is listed at $10 less per night as our original booking.  

I’m held to a no refund cancellation policy but these “hosts” get to pull this crap.  There is no way all this went down without notice.  It’s all so sketchy and suspect.
AND all of the communication about this is not through VRBO website. He’s texting me. ",1487,221,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/17ktf7j/i_feel_scammed/,2023-10-31 19:38:50,Vrbo
Vrbo,Done With VRBO,"Just had the worst experience with VRBO and I'm leaving the platform for good.

I have a strict noise policy plastered everywhere, but these guests went nuts. Got a text from my downstairs neighbor at 3am saying it sounded like someone was getting beaten upstairs - yelling and shuffling for hours.

Guests made up a suspicious story admitting to making the noise and sure enough there were more guests than booked for. Had to force them out myself after they kept pushing to stay. VRBO still hasn't responded properly, just sent a broken English email two days later. Now I'm stuck in a 40-minute phone call, fighting tooth and nail to get my bookings removed without incurring any fees.

Vrbo,Is This VRBO Listing in South of France Legit? Looking for Advice!,"Hey everyone,

I'm fairly new to VRBO and I've come across a listing for a vacation home in the South of France that can host up to 13 people. It looks like the perfect spot for our group, but I want to make sure it's legit before booking. Since I'm not that familiar with the site and how everything works, I thought I'd ask for some advice from those with more experience!

Here are some details:

Location: South of France
Capacity: 13 people
Price: (seems reasonable, but almost too good to be true)
The photos look professional, but I can't really tell if it's an honest deal.
Questions:

How can I verify if this listing is legitimate and if the host is trustworthy?
What are some red flags I should be aware of to spot scams on VRBO?
Do you have any tools or methods you use to thoroughly vet a vacation home before booking?
Has anyone had experience with VRBO in the South of France, and are there any local issues I should be aware of?
How has your experience been with VRBO’s customer service in case there are problems with the booking?
I’d really appreciate any help from those who are more familiar with VRBO. Any tips or insights are welcome, as I’d like to avoid losing money to a potentially fraudulent listing. 😊

Thanks so much for your help!

I can see my booking on VRBO and in the app.  When I click on the ""View Listing"" on my PC, the link takes me directly to the VRBO home page.  I can click ""View Listing"" in the app, but I cannot book any dates (I tried 2 or 3 weeknights mid-week in the dead season).  I tried chatting with VRBO who stated that sometimes ""hosts like to hide their properties from a search"".   My gut tells me the property owner pulled the property from VRBO.  How do I confirm?  I was never notified of any change.  I only looked at the property now to refresh my memory of what I had booked.  If the property has been pulled, do I have any recourse with VRBO other than a refund?  They have had my funds for 8 months now.

Vrbo,Help with an unsanitary vrbo ,"I was wondering if I am completely out of options here. I rented a condo out of state and was unaware of its condition. I booked it for 17 days. The rental seemed fine in the photos online, but when I arrived, I found the VRBO rental to be very unsanitary, with a broken AC and bugs everywhere.

I immediately tried to contact the host, but they didn't answer. I stayed the night and called the next day, at which point they said they would try to rebook the condo. Now they want to keep $2,550, even though it was a $150 per night room. Given that it was a 17-night stay, I’m willing to pay for the one night I stayed and the VRBO fees.

The host did issue a partial refund, but I still ended up paying a total of $1,800 for one night. The host is now saying I won’t get any more money back since they didn't rebook the condo after I left. This issue has been ongoing for three months. VRBO takes about a month to respond each time I reach out, and they are saying I won't get any more money back.

Do I have grounds to file a chargeback on my credit card, or should I just accept paying $1,800 for a one-night stay?",10,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1ed19jz/help_with_an_unsanitary_vrbo/,2024-07-26 22:47:31,Vrbo

Vrbo,Whats up with VRBO?,"This could be user error. I am already pretty established on airbnb as a superhost but I wanted to increase my catchment potential.

I dont use a channel manager but i sync calendars between airbnb and VRBo and In have them both configured in pricelabs where both ‘property listings’ (one airbnb and one vrbo but same house) are tied together so pricelabs knows its the same place.

I have 139 impressions and 65 views but absolutely no enquiries. It could be genuine but given i had ro manually configure everything in this new platform Im wondering if i fudged the config????

I am still taking bookings snd enquiries in airbnb

Moreover VRBO recommends INCREASING the price!!!! How is this going to get bookings?

Vrbo,"VRBO is holding my refund hostage unless I agree it's a 'full and final settlement."" Has anyone else had to agree that their refund was a settlement? How can I get my refund without agreeing it's a ""settlement""?","It took hours of calls and finally threatening VRBO that I’d go to media and social outlets with my story until they finally emailed about my refund. BUT BIG CATCH: in order to receive my own money back, VRBO wants to call my refund a “settlement.” They said it 3 times in one email. They wrote they want me to “acknowledge and agree that the stated settlement amount is the full and final settlement of your claim. Please confirm your agreement by replying to this email and stating: ‘I accept the agreed settlement amount of $1,XXX.XX USD and acknowledge it is the full and final settlement of my claim.' After we receive your agreement statement, we will submit your reimbursement for payment. Be sure to include your agreement statement because we need that to initiate your payout.”

SAY WHAT? I have to agree that my refund is a full and final settlement? Surely VRBO can’t hold my refund hostage by making me agree that getting my own money back is a settlement or force me to release them of liability with this underhand tactic and give up the right to purse litigation and collect damages against anyone I might deem appropriate. How is this even legal?  How can I get my refund without agreeing it's a ""settlement""?

The Host terrorized us. We arrived on Aug 18. On Aug 19-Host called at 10:30 p.m. & told us to get the F out of his house. Tried to talk but he repeated it so hung up on him. I called & reported to VRBO (877-202-4291). They called host for his reason; he said we were harassing him. (We only had 2 phone calls with the guy & no harassment.)  On the phone with VRBO for over an hour on night #2.

Aug 20- on our 3rd night host's voice booms in living room at 8:45 p.m. and says ”get the F out my house. I'm calling 911.” We find source of his voice - a hidden camera and unplug it. Host calls (I don’t answer - he's unhinged). His message says he saw me on camera and he’s calling police. Ten minutes later, six (6) San Diego sheriffs arrive w/lights on- due to 911 call from host reporting burglary in progress. One of the men in our group stood on the deck with his hands in the air so police would know we weren't a threat. We prove lawful presence -VRBO contract & police talk to VRBO. I spent the next 1 hour and 49 mins on phone w/VRBO who is responsive to my concerns. Told them I wanted to leave for fear of our safety and I wanted my money back and agent responded the only way to get a refund is to vacate the property. VRBO said we could leave immediately to a hotel and pay for it or wait until the next morning when their reservations dept opens and they'd pay. It's midnight so too late to find accommodations on my own, clean, pack, leave and video document that we left it clean & undamaged.

On Aug 21, Monday morning, I spent three (3) hours and 20 minutes on phone w/VRBO securing a hotel for our last evening. They had a list of approved area properties, or I could look for one myself. I googled on my laptop while on the phone. I didn't want another house and the clean up that would come with checkout the next morning so opted for a hotel. We were 5 adults and were offered 3 rooms at the Best Western but I requested the Omni since they had a pool which was comparable to the San Diego area house (of terror). The Omni was on vrbo list as a pre-pay by the guest for reimbursement by VRBO. I said I don't have money to pay and wait for them to pay me back. Agent needed approval for them to pay so placed me on hold and call was disconnected. I called back and had to re-explain everything and VRBO agreed to 2 rooms at the Omni and I would be responsible for sales tax.

As family was packing rental car, host's friend drove up and said host called and told him his house was being broken into.

All this was more than just an inconvenience. The host ruined 2 nights and our last vacation day was shortened and interrupted because of  him. We had to do all that packing, cleaning and video documenting a day early, and had to relocate and bring our things into the hotel. Monday became a rush. We had no breakfast, grabbed a snack in the car at noon, missed our kayaking, lunch was later than we wanted and dinner was a quick bite instead of the sit down birthday evening I’d planned. By 8 p.m. I was too tired and stressed to enjoy walking the Gaslamp District with my family and skipped it. Not trying to play poor me, but this guy took a huge chunk of enjoyable family time away from us during our short 4 day vacation. My total time spent on the phone with VRBO in San Diego was 6 hours.

I called VRBO on Aug 27 and spent 45 minutes explaining everything and asking for a refund. Was told case was escalated to violations dept and someone would get back to me, but I was also told that they leave the refund up to the owner. I told them host can’t have that choice since he violated VRBO policy by having a “surveillance device that captured audio and/or video” inside the property and further violated VRBO policy by failing to disclose on the property description page the “location and coverage” of any outdoor camera.

On Sept 13 I called for the status of refund and was told by VRBO that due to a mixup between departments, my refund request was never submitted. I start working with my credit card company for a charge back as my purchase definitely wasn't as described, and my faith in getting a response or  refund from VRBO is slim.

On Sept 23 I received email from host of $206 refund, I call VRBO & said unacceptable, and agent said the higher department, ""America's Warranty"" has the power to proceed even if the host doesn't agree, and that the case was in for a full refund but a timeframe is unavailable. ""They work on their own schedule"" she said. I told agent I was ready to go to the media in San Diego as well as all social media platforms. Shortly after, I received the email from VRBO telling me I could get the refund only if I agreed it was a “full and final settlement.”

I have a legitimate case against  the host for having a hidden camera inside the house and filing a false police report against us. Would I, could I, should I ever pursue it? Probably not but ... were I to request a settlement from VRBO it would be $5K and a vacation re-do. But I'm not requesting a settlement - just a refund!  I've never given them the impression I wanted anything more than just my money back from the guy who turned our stay at his house into a nightmare. The property has been taken down from VRBO and they did right by us with the relocation because of the number of problems with the host and I called as the events were occurring. But if I wanted to hire a lawyer and purse a claim against either VRBO or the host, returning the email and agreeing that my refund is a ""full and final settlement"" stops me from doing so. I have no desire to take it any further than my refund but it's the principal of VRBO making me agree that my refund is a settlement that's my issue.

VRBO receipt doesn't even make sense. The place was advertised for 5 people, and we were 5 people who rented, yet the host was allowed to charge a $100 extra guest fee. It’s unclear what amount the sales tax is being calculated on or at what percent, we were forced to buy insurance for $59, and VRBO’s receipt totals $2,064.68 from the individual items listed, but says I paid $1,814.68 = credit card charged $1,755.68 by Home Away, and $59 by insurance. The incorrect total of $2,064.68 makes me wonder if sales tax was charged on $2,064.68, or $1,814.68 the total actually paid with the insurance added in, or the $1,755.68 charge to the credit card by Home Away.

The host’s property description on VRBO of a “Resort Style…Vacation Home” was completely inaccurate. There was little about this home that was clean enough for the quality of a resort, and we didn’t have much of a vacation there. The host has prescription Narcan for drug overdose in the kitchen and both bathrooms.  The property smelled musty in the living room, the refrigerator stunk like rotten food and the teflon pots and pans were so worn out I felt they were unsafe for cooking. The primary bathroom was dirty and there were black hairs everywhere. The outside furniture is disgustingly dirty and the covered porch hasn’t seen a cleaning since 1999.

This company has a partnership with VRBO and has over 22,000 properties listed with them .Had another meeting with the property managers today about VRBO and one suggestion they had was that we consider allowing pets.

We had a stay planned for next month 10 max guests (6 adults; 4 kids (3,3,5&7)). Our niece (12) now needs to join us for the week due to a change in her camp schedule. I contacted VRBO and they said no exceptions could be made to allow the additional guest (I offered to pay any additional fee). So we had to cancel and lost 50% of the cost. The host loses 50% and might not be able to rebook (or they might and may make out more on the situation - maybe they are ok with the situation?).

Vrbo,New to vrbo. Can host cancel reservation?,"Hi, new to using vrbo. Looking to take a group of people to an extremely popular event. Have found a great property with a rate significantly less than comparable properties at that time. Like, several thousand $ cheaper over the course of the week. 

We’ve reached out to the host to confirm they are aware of the popularity of this timing and to verify their pricing for this week. 

My question is, if we book at the current rate, can the host cancel our reservation and raise the rates?  I assume if I have a reservation the rates can’t change on me, but the primary concern is the host canceling. 

Can someone help me understand how this works and whether I have assurances once I book?

Vrbo,VRBO displaying incorrect price,"Im experiencing an issue with a guest who booked a stay but VRBO displayed the incorrect price. The difference is $1000 a night. I got 2 different stories from agents. One this morning said that there was a tech issue and reverted the pricing back and told me to send a request for additional payment and if they do not pay by the deadline I can cancel without penalty

Then I got an email saying the guest contacted them and they are asking me to honor the $600 price vs $1600 price. I find is very strange that my calendar reflects $1600 every night for the month except for the days this person booked. The second agent said it must have been my fault and that I cannot force them to pay the additional amount and that even if the deadline passes for payment request and I decide to cancel I will be penalized regardless. 
This is the second major issue I’ve had with VRBO in 2 months. 
Has anyone had any luck escalating such issues of incompetency to the someone in corporate that can actually do something vs the support people that barely speak English?!?!?",14,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1e7fz6q/vrbo_displaying_incorrect_price/,2024-07-19 22:11:18,Vrbo
Vrbo,Alternatives to VRBO?,"This is the 2nd summer season using VRBO for our single family vacation rental. Bookings are only 60% of what they were in 2021 and I’m very competitively priced for the area. I see lots of talk about poor support from VRBO and wonder about any true higher scaled competitive services to VRBO. Plus the high fees and lack of allowing the annual subscription (and instead, charging my side 8% rather than the 3% in the last), have me looking for alternatives.  I also have my own home which is on airbnb and doing gangbusters. Does anyone here have opinions on putting a VRBO type property on airbnb, or is there a good alternative? Thanks.

Vrbo,VRBO Removed My Negative Review,"I stayed in a place overnight last year and had one of the worst experiences I've ever had staying at a rental. It was at a downtown apartment complex, not in the safest neighborhood. I couldn't get into the building for something like 30-45 minutes because the host didn't send me a code for the front door (I had one for the actual apartment itself). I tried contacting them multiple ways and they didn't get back to me, so I was stuck standing outside. Finally, someone who lived there took pity and opened the door for me. The host did eventually message me the building code about an hour after I had been let in by the resident.

You weren't allowed to park where the residents park (a garage under the building), so you're forced to use street parking that cost something like $1.75/hr and you couldn't park in the same spot for too long or you'd get towed.

I had a job to do in town the next day and tried to sleep but the apartment above me was blaring music at full volume, causing the walls to vibrate. I thought they'd stop, but after midnight I got dressed and went up there to confront them. The guy opened the door and the whole place looked like a hotbox, with smoke everywhere. He was super high, and I asked if he could turn the music down as I had an all-day job I had to be up early for the next day. He did turn it down a little, but not much, and at 7am it was blaring again.

I left a negative review and the host lied and said I did get the door code and that I was extremely rude, and I can't even remember the rest. I was never rude to them, and I have the message to prove they finally sent me the building code well after I had arrived. My review stayed up for over five months and then I just recently happened to go back to the page for the property and saw my review was gone. I called VRBO and they said it was removed because it violated their policy on what's allowed in reviews. I wasn't allowed to mention the cost of the parking and that the guy in the apartment upstairs was high.

They said I should have received an automated email with a link to re-edit the review to remove those things. I looked back through all of my emails and my spam folder and I never received that email. I didn't even receive anything saying it was removed. I've talked to VRBO on several occasions and they've said their team looked over everything and they're not able to let me edit my review or leave a new one.

Currently, on the property's page there are three reviews, one mentioned that four people were shot in the neighborhood while the person was staying there and that two died and the other mentions that you have to pay an extra $50 if you want to be able to park at the property (which I don't think was even an option when I was there). Both of those things supposedly go against their review policies, but those reviews are still up.

They've blocked my ability to email them now. If I send an email this is what I get:

They also won't let me speak to a supervisor if I call. I truly think they removed my review because the host (MGM Properties) has a bunch of properties listed on the site and probably requested my negative review be removed and VRBO would much rather keep them happy than allow me to let other customers know about my experience.",11,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1b7a8ck/vrbo_removed_my_negative_review/,2024-03-05 16:58:09,Vrbo

Vrbo,VRBO refuses to issue a refund,"If we’re the ones in the wrong here, please let me know, but I think the situation amounts to theft.

A few months back my wife booked a VRBO on short notice for a period of about a month. Events transpired, and she quickly cancelled the booking, less than 30 minutes after making it. The booking was made only a couple of days out from the intended stay dates, and the refund policy was a strict one (I don’t recall exactly which policy), so no refund was issued. The cost was around $7,000 USD. 

We spoke with the property manager, who spoke with the property owner. Crickets. So we disputed the charge with the credit card company. They eventually got back to us and informed us that the charge would go through because of the refund policy.

From my perspective, the time between the booking and the cancellation was so short there is no way we could have caused the property owner to lose revenue. I fully realize the policy is the policy, but I have a hard time not feeling like the property owner views this as a chance to net a cool $7k without having to do a damn thing, and it’s highly unethical for them to keep the money.

Vrbo,Booking was a boarded up building ,"We booked a place in LA, and when we arrived, the building was boarded up, and the gate to access the flat had a refrigerator blocking the door. 

While we were standing there, a person came by and said he was ""just driving by, but worked for the rental agency, and wanted to know if we needed help"". 

He said he didn't know this flat was in this condition, but that it wasn't supposed to be listed. 

And then offered to switch us to another flat, and that a different person would call us with details. 
Neither person was the person named as the contact for the rental. 

As the other rental was in a totally different area, and did not meet our needs, we declined. 

And contacted vrbo customer support. 
Wow, what a travesty of customer service. 

First agent had us send pictures and bank statement of proof of payment, and then said, let me transfer you... (The first call was 90 minutes)
And then another person gets on, seemingly with all our info, but very antagonist. 

And we had to explain every again. 
All the while, we are sitting in our car in LA, and its getting later and later. 

At the end, they said, we have to reach out to the agency that listed the property with us, for them to refund the money. 
2hr and 45 minutes from the beginning. 
And they could offer no help with getting another same day rental. 

Still waiting on the refund 
Its two days later now, and no word from them. 


As a very frequent traveler, Id say this has been one of the biggest bummers Ive encountered while travelling. 

Would not recommend.

Vrbo,Never using VRBO again,"January of 2023, I booked a property in Austin for last weekend's eclipse, knowing that it was going to be a busy and expensive weekend. We put down the deposit for a place that was going to be for 16 adults and 3 kids. We paid the remainder of the fee in March. The booking was for April 5th - 9th. I was going to fly in a day before (the 4th), stay with friends and then pick up rented vans to ferry everyone from the airport Friday (again anticipating things being busy). 

On the evening of April 3rd, I get a message from the host that they have cancelled the reservation, refunded my money due to someone booking on a different site ""months before"" me. I had literally no recourse. Everyone in the party just bailed since there was no other places we could have rented to accommodate our group on such short of notice on such a busy weekend. Over a year of planning just gone. 

Now, if \*I\* had cancelled two days before the booking, I would have lost everything, but there's no punishment for a lister who clearly got either a better offer or just realized they could cancel it and re-list it for more money?

Vrbo,Is VRBO giving up?,"I want to start off by saying that this is anecdotal; This is my experience as a host on VRBO for almost 10 years now. I have 2 homes and I co-host 6 cabins in the Big Bear. Not only have the rentals significantly reduced but the page views are down tremendously. I get the feeling Expedia is abandoning it in favor of their platform. The Big Bear cabins are killing it on Expedia. 

What does VRBO actually offer that is any different from Airbnb now? They have pretty much adopted the same business model so now it's just as expensive to rent on that platform. Now it only comes down to user experience and I think Airbnb has them beat. I realize some of you are on the old model (pay per year) but that is not a choice for a lot of us. 

As a host, I'm constantly receiving scam inquiries. I never get them on Airbnb. When I receive a legitimate request, most guests have zero reviews. It's scarier for me to rent on VRBO. Airbnb vets the guest more. Again, this is my experience. 

If VRBO wants to get back in the game, I suggest not charging such a high %. Undercut Airbnb and their ridiculous 12% guest fee.  They used to be the top dog, then Airbnb kicked them in the pants and they decided the best thing to do is copy Airbnb. I remember when it was just a marketplace. They connected you to the host and then they were out. I honestly think that model would kill right now in this economy. People want to take trips but they are sick of all of the fees.

Vrbo,VRBO Listing Did Not Mention Host Living in Rental,"Last week I booked a rental for Super Bowl weekend, and after reviewing old reviews for the property I come to find out the host actually lives on the second floor of the property. No where on the listing did it say the second floor was occupied by the host’s family and that my rental is limited to the first floor. 

I reached out to the host to let them know that I was misled to believe I was paying for a private property to me and my guests (two other couples). Had I known they lived on the property, I would’ve booked a different rental. The worst part about all of this is that the host has a strict cancellation policy so now I can’t get my money back for cancelling. On top of that, the host has also changed the description of the listing, so they must know they were in the wrong. 

Do I have a valid case with Vrbo’s customer service? I mean all of Vrbo’s commercials brag about private rental homes yet I get stuck with a place that is not a true private experience.",7,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/104nfcx/vrbo_listing_did_not_mention_host_living_in_rental/,2023-01-06 06:55:39,Vrbo
Vrbo,"The high service fees imposed by Vrbo have become a significant deterrent for potential guests, preventing them from finalizing their bookings. As homeowners, we strive to heed the counsel of platforms like Vrbo. Vrbo service fees are a roadblock to our success. Are other home owners as frustrated?","Dear Vrbo Team,

I am writing as a concerned homeowner who has been a loyal partner of Vrbo for some time now. I believe in the potential of our collaboration and the value we can collectively provide to travelers seeking unforgettable vacation experiences. However, I am compelled to address a pressing issue that is affecting not only my business but also the larger community of homeowners like me.

First and foremost, I would like to express my appreciation for Vrbo's efforts to encourage competitive pricing as a means to attract more bookings. It is evident that offering a compelling rate is a pivotal factor in capturing traveler attention and boosting performance on the platform. I have heeded your advice and worked diligently to adjust my pricing to align with market demands.

Nonetheless, I am perplexed by the apparent disconnect between Vrbo's recommendations and the fee structure that remains unchanged. The high service fees imposed by Vrbo have become a significant deterrent for potential guests, preventing them from finalizing their bookings. I have heard countless accounts from prospective clients who express genuine interest in my property, only to be dissuaded by the additional service fees imposed by Vrbo. This concerning trend has resulted in lost bookings and revenue for my business, as well as the wider community of homeowners.

I implore you to consider the impact of these fees on our collective success. While I acknowledge the necessity of maintaining a sustainable business model, it is disheartening to witness these fees escalating without regard for the financial challenges that homeowners must navigate. Many of us are burdened with numerous expenses, such as rising interest rates, mortgages, taxes, insurance bills, maintenance costs, and utilities. As the cost of living continues to rise, these challenges are exacerbated, making it increasingly difficult for us to offer competitive rates that align with Vrbo's recommendations.

I recently received another email from Vrbo, reiterating the importance of price competitiveness. However, it struck me as ironic that Vrbo advocates for lower prices while seemingly disregarding the impact of its own fees on our ability to compete effectively. A client's inquiry encapsulates the sentiment perfectly: ""I know this may be a long shot, but the property is a little out of my price range because of the additional service fees, I was wondering if there was any wiggle room on these service fees.""

As a solution-oriented individual, I would like to propose a more equitable approach. It is my sincere hope that Vrbo will consider revisiting its fee structure, taking into account the challenges faced by homeowners like me. By doing so, we can create a win-win scenario where both homeowners and Vrbo can thrive together. A reduction in your service fees would undoubtedly make our properties more appealing to potential guests and significantly enhance our booking rates.

So I ask Vrbo to acknowledge the vital role homeowners play in the success of the platform and to reconsider your current service fee structure. Collaboration and compromise are essential for a sustainable and prosperous partnership. By working together to alleviate the burden of excessive fees, we can foster an environment where everyone benefits – from homeowners to travelers to Vrbo itself.

Thank you for taking the time to read and consider my concerns. I am optimistic that, by addressing this issue, we can forge a stronger, more productive relationship that ultimately benefits us all.

Sincerely,

All the homeowners who make you money!",23,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/164ui4x/the_high_service_fees_imposed_by_vrbo_have_become/,2023-08-29 21:09:29,Vrbo
Vrbo,Do not book with VRBO unless you want to lose your money,"Don't make the same mistakes I did. VRBO IS AWFUL. My first time booking, I chose a property that offered a full refund before July 31. I canceled my reservation in May, two months before that deadline, and after 30 days, still did not get my refund. So it starts:  
  
I tried contacting my host. They tried to make me update my credit card on a third party link... uh phishing alert. There were also a number of grammatical errors and misspellings. Sus.

I tried calling VRBO. They are useless. I probably called 6-7 times and got the same useless response - ""You booked with a trusted property owner, don't worry you will get your money back. It's just taking a while because they have a third party payment platform. Just contact your host."" As if I didn't try that.

I tried contacting my host again. They told me something completely different than the first time - that they are trying to refund me but stripe is throwing an error so I should go contact stripe. Stripe???? The backend payments platform are you joking??? 

I tried calling VRBO more, everytime I just reach deadend after deadend. I've spent hours trying to explain my situation to them. 

  
In the end, after multiple mornings spend waiting on the phone, multiple weeks waiting on escalations and ""cases"", VRBO sends me this email   
""After reviewing your request, we suggest that you contact your financial institution or credit card issuer to inquire about options for the return of your funds.   You can provide your credit card issuer with a copy of this email, in order to seek further assistance in recovering any charges for the referenced Reservation ID

The ac is controlled by a key which is padlocked to the door key so if you leave you must turn the ac off.  Almost 1000 sqft two small mini splits, 3 hours later the temp is still 88 in the apartment. The floors are filthy food crumbs and dirt everywhere and trash left in a bag.  I tried to contact the host, no response. A hour later I'm on the phone with vrbo, they try to contact the host no answer. At this point they tell me these are minor issues and they will give me $75 refund.  No reolution on the issues.

Vrbo,What is going on with this VRBO?,"So I booked a VRBO for June 1st.  It’s in a pretty rural area and this specific VRBO is really the only option for my group. I got a message from the host saying they can no longer host me on that date and they asked me if I would be willing to go to their other property instead. 

The other property is a downgrade, but honestly still the best option we have and the host offered a discount.  So I said sure, let’s do it.  She said this is great and that she’ll send me the check in details on the day of my check in.  Never updated my reservation with the new property or anything.  

Then today I got a notification that my original reservation was switched from June 1st to November.  

What the heck is going on?  This all seems weird and fishy and unprofessional.  I’m thinking maybe she is trying to do this VRBO under the table so cancelling/switching the property on me doesn’t impact her rating?

Vrbo,Refund on VRBO fee?,"Let me preface by saying my property is managed by Avantstay.  That’s a story for another day.  Prior to Avantstay purchasing our previous property manager’s company, we had many bookings,  most of which were through Vrbo. I am aware of the disaster that VRBO has become, so I’m not completely sure how much of this problem is a result of the new management company and how much results from  VRBO‘s well-documented problems. Probably a combination of both. 
Anyhoo, we paid $600 to list with VRBO in October. We have not had a single booking through them all year. I’m sure part of that has to do with the fact that our listing inconsistently appears when we go to look for it. Yes,  we contact Avantstay about this,  and it will appear for a bit then disappear, so we call Avantstay, and the cycle continues. 
My question is has anyone ever gotten a refund from VRBO if they don’r get a single booking?

Vrbo,"Vrbo owner attempting to get us to pay an extra $1000 for a ""noise complaint""","We rented a Vrbo this last weekend. We knew we were going to have some extra guests over, and we contacted out host and they said that since it was an event it would have an extra fee. We agreed and paid a $1000 outside of Vrbo invoices just over Venmo to the host. We then had some guests over that Saturday night. We knew that there was a noise policy, so we intentionally kept music and talking levels low, kept all doors and windows closed, and did periodic sound checks outside.   


In the morning the host reached out and told us that there was a complaint from a neighbor and we would need to pay another $1000. In their rules/details they had a section stating that they would do this. They attached a NoiseAware screenshot of the level inside the living room - while there was noise for when the guests were over it never crossed the 100db notification threshold.

We are unsure of how to handle this for a few reasons. We aren't really sure if there was a legitimate complaint, as its just the hosts word and we did a good job regulating volume. It also feels like we're just being extorted because of the NoiseAware monitor, and we previously already paid $1000 to be able to have additional guests over. Can anyone talk to the validity of the hosts claim? Is this sort of post-rental additional charge that they attached actually enforceable?",15,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1bhkhtl/vrbo_owner_attempting_to_get_us_to_pay_an_extra/,2024-03-18 06:52:20,Vrbo

Vrbo,Property had a broken bed. How much compensation should I ask for?,"I recently ended an 8-night stay at a 2-bed, 2-bath apartment near Washington, DC. Upon arrival, I noted that the frame of one of the beds was broken, causing the bed to slant to one side. I immediately reported this to the host (with pictures), and within a couple of hours, they agreed to replace the bed.

On day three, they messaged me that the new bed was in the building, but I didn't see the message or respond until day 4. I agreed to be present for someone to bring the new bed on day five and waited all day, but no one showed up. Later that day, I got a message simply indicating that they'd be there the following day.

It ultimately took 6 days for the new bed to arrive in the unit. I'd like some compensation for having to sleep on an uncomfortable, slanted bed for 5 nights. I'm particularly disappointed by the lack of communication, as they never showed up the day they said they would and offered no apology or explanation for not being there as agreed.

What's reasonable compensation to ask for in this situation?

EDIT: I truly didn't expect this to generate such a response. There's a clear division in this post between hosts and guests. I'll comment on a few general themes:

""Move the mattress to the floor"" or ""get an air mattress"": there wasn't space to put any mattress on the floor in this apartment without removing the broken bed.

""Sleep in the other room or on the couch"": All other sleeping surfaces were occupied.

""Fix it yourself, go to Home Depot"": C'mon, really? I'm vacationing out of town without a car and paying for a 2-bed, 2-bath apartment specifically to accommodate everyone in my party. The idea that this was ever my responsibility to fix seems absurd. I did try to place some of the broken legs back under the frame, but they collapsed as soon as any weight was put on the bed.

Vrbo,Considering legal action against VRBO,"I reserved a place on VRBO thinking that I was booking a private property only to find out the day I move in that the owner and her son would be living at the property throughout the duration of my stay. I left after finding this out and have spent hours on phone calls and emails with support trying to get a full refund, and at one point it seemed like it was going to happen. But it never did and now VRBO is taking the owner's side and claiming that it is okay for the owner to have a shared space on their platform. This lack of support and consistency should be illegal and I hope that legal action may help.

Vrbo,Guest had a wedding without asking,"I'll try to keep it short.     

Rented for two nights, 8 people max. Checked in at 3 on Sunday.  About 10:30 our neighbor calls my wife (she was traveling out of state) who then calls me.  Tells me that I need to get there ASAP and see what's going on.  I was about 30 min away so I jumped in the car and headed over.

Neighbor said there were at least 25 cars parked in the yard (we have 3 acres so not an issue), people smoking (it's a non-smoking property) and looked like a huge party.    While I was driving my wife was messaging the guy on the app.  He said it was his wedding night and ""whats the big deal?""  She told him that the cops were coming.   

Side note: our property is also a wedding venue but weddings are not booked through VRBO or AirBnB because of logistics, insurance, etc.  We make that very clear on the sites and he never said anything about a wedding or a party.

The cops won't come, they consider it a civil matter, but it obviously scared them because by the time I got there everyone was gone.  There was a really nice Mercedes in the driveway, but no people.  I could see tire tracks in the grass where a lot of cars had been parked.  

Inside was a complete mess.  Furniture moved around and clutter everywhere.  Nothing damaged, but the amount of trash was unbelievable.  They had been there just 7 hours and there were countless half drank Korean drink boxes (some kind of pink milky looking drink), 50 microwaveable Ramen cups, tons of styrofoam containers from takeout, empty Coke cans and beer bottles everywhere.  Plastic wrappers on the floor in every room, on the couches, counters. Everywhere.  They had used every piece of silverware and all the plates and bowls.

They hadn't spent one night yet, but all of the beds looked like they had been slept in and three of the four bathrooms were covered in make-up where girls were getting ready to go out (presumably).  There was only one suitcase left in the house, so I rounded that up along with toiletries and put it on the front porch.  I deleted their access code and told them to come get their car and their luggage and to leave.  

We haven't heard anything from them and we received full payment from VRBO this morning.  ",647,316,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/192ihoy/guest_had_a_wedding_without_asking/,2024-01-09 16:21:09,Vrbo
Vrbo,VRBO Munising Michigan HUGE disappointment ,"Munising is a quiet, quaint little town on the south shore of Lake Superior in the middle of the Michigan Upper Peninsula. With a population of just under 2000, Munising provides what can only be described as a Norman Rockwell 4th of July experience. If you've ever been for the 4th, you will want to go back again and again.  I say this so when I tell you that places to stay are limited, it's an enormous understatement.  There are few, and what is offered is booked months, if not years, in advance.

I knew this would be disappointing when I booked the house to leave on a Saturday; the host emailed me back, telling me their cleaning crew would be available on Sunday, so if I wanted the house, I had to pay through Sunday.  Not wanting to risk not having a place to stay, I agreed.  Another indication this would be a tough visit is that there was no washer and dryer for a house that sleeps 11 and is so remote.  Note the location: you have to pack for Spring, Summer, and Winter in the Upper Peninsula; dressing in layers is now not an option.  Washing anything is not an option. Oh sure, let me take a day out of my vacation to visit the local laundry mat. Thank you, but no. In the guest book, this is a repeated suggestion dating back to 2017, when the owners responded with, ""We are getting one for next season.""

When we arrived, the yard was utterly neglected. The grass was weeks and weeks past due for a cut. The bushes and trees in front of the house were so overgrown that you could not see off the porch while sitting on the swing or in the chairs.

Entering the house through the back as instructed, the first door had been damaged, so it did not lock; the inside door was not locked and was actually open.  An open house is not a good feeling in a strange house in a strange town.  There was no bottled water, snacks, welcome book or page to welcome you. These are things that I have previously taken for granted at VRBOs.  Imagine traveling all day with a family to arrive at a bare-bone empty house in a tiny town where the one store and everything else is closed for the night.

There was not a functioning clock in the entire house.  The giant kitchen has six 40-watt bulbs, none of which are near the stove, it's dark. The vanity in the main bathroom has room for three light fixtures; one was completely missing, and the other two bulbs don't match, so there is this odd blue-yellow light. The ceiling paint was peeling and falling in almost every room.  If the paint in the room wasn't peeling, it was the worst paint job ever. One coat that you can see through. Not even ""good enough"" by the laziest of standards.  There was no ice, no ice trays, and the one functioning door knob fell off on day two. We had to hide the door knob on the side we were locking, yes even the outside. The front screen door is being held together with a mile of duct tape.   The outside of the house was in need of painting about four seasons ago.  There is moss on the railings and steps front and rear, so thick my daughter slipped and fell. The cute fire pit in the picture with the blue chairs is not there at all.  There is a rusted-out something if a ring with ashes in the middle, placed in the middle of the overgrown grass and no chairs anywhere.  Decorations were homemade printed pictures and glued to the wall of the kitchen.

I was catfished by a VRBO. What could be a giant, beautiful home is nothing but a huge mess. This is an example of supply and demand when the demand is high, and supply is low. The owners could not care less about their guests. If you want to be in Munising, you will pay the price, pay for extra days you won't stay, and you will like it because there are no other options. Don't even think about cute little extras, amenities, or comfort items.

Avoid this place, avoid the owners,  UNLESS you are looking to experience what it is like to live in a place you can't afford to maintain. The insult here is the $3200 for six nights we paid. What an absolute joke. In their email, Erin and Jacob made it a point to tell me they have 23 other properties. The hospitality would be the same for each one. If I have ever heard one, this is a passive-aggressive ""we got you"" comment.

Vrbo,VRBO owner didn’t disclose a second rental space ahead of time?,"Hi there,
My family is staying at a VRBO on our vacation to Washington DC. Strictly speaking, the VRBO is in Virginia. 

When we arrived, we noticed that the basement was off limits/locked up, which isn’t unheard of but a little odd for a VRBO since their whole advertising is based around owners renting out “the whole house.” There are stairs leading down from inside the house, and stairs leading from the backyard to the basement. Both are locked. A family member was in the backyard when he noticed that there was clearly someone moving around inside the basement. 

Neither the listing nor the check-in instructions disclosed that there was any second listing within the house, or that the owner could possibly be living in the basement. We feel a bit creeped out and put off by this situation. If it’s the owner living in the basement, they have full access to us and our belongings while we’re in the house. 

My question is, is this potentially grounds for getting a refund? We’re currently awaiting a response from the owner to see if there is supposed to be anyone in the basement or not, so we don’t have a clear answer at this point.

I reached out to the host of the Vrbo listing asking if we could cancel the booking without penalty. Because the reservation was less than 60 days away (Vrbo's cancellation window), the host said he could not refund me. But after I explained to him the circumstances, he agreed to grant me a full refund. I have this in Vrbo's message log.

After the date of the reservation, I reached out to the host asking about the status of the refund. He said he’ll talk it over with his team and get back to me. He never did. Ever since then, I have tried reaching out to him through Vrbo messaging, Vrbo support, and even directly. If I could get ahold of him, he would always respond with ""I'll talk to my team and get back to you tomorrow"". Otherwise, he would just ghost me. 

Vrbo said they can't do anything to force the refund as this was an agreement made between the host and myself outside of Vrbo's cancellation window. Today, I tried calling Vrbo support again to help get ahold of the host, and the agent was able to get through.

Vrbo,"VRBO Host Asked Me to Cancel, Still Available On Airbnb?","This morning I was browsing VRBO looking for housing for a large group for a weekend (3 days) and I found an incredible spot. The price was really great so I booked it. 

Not long after I received a message from the host saying they no longer work with VRBO and that I should cancel my booking.

Naturally I reached out to support because I wasn't sure if it was legitimate. I use VRBO a lot and this had never happened before. They said the listing is active. Then I received a phone call, then text from the host telling me that I need to cancel. All of this in about a 30 minute window.

The listing is on Airbnb for about $7,000 more, so I assume it was a mistake in pricing. The host has been on both platforms for 3 years and has several other properties. I wouldn't want to hurt someone financially for keeping my listing, but they seem to be fine in that regard. 

I know that they are in violation of both VRBO and Airbnb terms of service by not removing the other listing now that it's booked.  

  
My questions are: is there a way for VRBO and Airbnb to communicate a booking so that it is not double booked? Should I ask the host to remove the airbnb listing? Should I book the Airbnb as well (free cancellation for a while yet, so I wouldn't have to pay) and let them know I'm happy to report them to both platforms if they don't honor my original booking? Hate to do the last one, but I feel this is poor behavior by them after they essentially harassed me and went way out of bounds to try to get me to cancel a legitimate booking.

Vrbo,Help!  Our Vrbo was abandoned and we are stranded!,"UPDATE: Just wanted to let anyone who read my earlier post how things turned out.  We found a lovely Airbnb Friday night on very short notice.  The host was very helpful and welcoming.  As many of you said, VRBO never did call us back.  

Thank you for everyone’s well wishes and suggestions.  I truly didn’t know that VRBO had such a terrible reputation.  We have only ever had positive experiences.

We will be pursuing some type of action when we get home but not sure what, yet.  I’m still shocked that they would just flat out lie to us repeatedly about trying to help us.



We are in a bit of a situation and don’t know what to do.  Any advice you have would be appreciated.  I booked a Vrbo back in October for a very highly rated and popular cottage on Vancouver Island.  When we arrived, it was filthy, it was obvious nobody had prepared for our arrival.  The main house on the property also appeared abandoned.  We tried to contact the owner but their number was not in service.  We spoke to the neighbours and they said the owners had left.

I contacted Vrbo that evening (July 31).  The rep advised me to book our own accommodation for 2 nights and they would reimburse us up to a specific amount.  It was not easy to find a place but we were fortunate to find one rental left.  The Vrbo rep said that the relocation team would be in touch the next day to give us options on a different Vrbo for the remaining 3 days of our trip.  

I called Vrbo twice yesterday and was told they were working on finding us a new place to stay.  The reps said they had escalated the matter and to be patient.  They reassured me someone would be in touch ASAP.  

This morning I used the chat function to speak to another rep.  She said she would mark the matter as urgent (I assumed this was urgent from day 1) and said we should hear back within an hour.  2 hours passed so I called again, as we had still not heard back from the relocation team.   She apologized for our experience.  I asked if there was a supervisor I could speak to and she said she would try but that the queue was quite long.  I told her I was fine waiting as we literally are sitting on the side of the road, not knowing where to go.

It took so long, she finally apologized and said her manager will call me back but it might take a couple of hours.  That was a couple of hours ago and we have still not heard back.  

So now it is the long weekend, virtually everything is booked up.  We are 1800 km from home and spent 3 days travelling to this Vrbo.  It seems impossible to get in touch with the relocation team and now we can’t even try to book a Vrbo on our own for tonight because it appears the site doesn’t allow same day bookings.  

This has ruined our vacation.  I’m so stressed about this and I can’t believe Vrbo isn’t doing more to assist us.  Does anyone have advice or know how to reach the relocation team?",804,221,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1eiky6e/help_our_vrbo_was_abandoned_and_we_are_stranded/,2024-08-02 20:52:52,Airbnb
Vrbo,"Selling my VRBO/Airbnb business with 8 properties, ADVICE?","My husband and I have a small but very successful Short Term Rental business in Louisville, Kentucky, Built over the last 15 years, we have 8 pieces of real estate, all within walking distance of our primary residence, in the most sought after area of the city for short term rentals. 5 are commercially zones condos, the other 3 are larger homes with very hard to get CUPs (conditional use permits) for STR use. It is now impossible to get a CUP in the neighborhood these houses are in. Listed on Airbnb and Vrbo with superhost/premier host status, fantastic reviews and many returning guests that book directly. Our rents last year were 650k and we have about 225k on the books in future bookings.

We are ready to retire and cash out. And, we are exploring selling the entire package- all is held within a single LLC. The CUPs and permits would transfer to the new owner. We are willing to include our actual Airbnb account in the sale. Vrbo allows the transfer the reviews with proof of address (though I don't think Premier Host is transferable). We would credit the deposits we have for future direct bookings to the purchase price.

We want to sell the whole LLC both for the ease of a single transaction and because we would benefit tax wise by having the profit be capital gains rather than ordinary income. The purchaser would benefit from the property taxes not being immediately increased as they are in a straight real estate sale.

Here are my questions:

Have you, either as a buyer or seller, ever done a transaction like this. That is, that is the purchase or sale of an LLC containing real estate, future bookings, permits, etc.? If so, how did it go? Would you do it again? What was the down side, if any?

Where does one find potential buyers for this sort of small business? The couple of online marketplaces I have found for small businesses or STRs look sketchy.

Tonight, the kitchen sink backed up while we were preparing to do dishes. I took it upon myself to scoop all the water out and check the p-trap, all clear - major plumbing blockage. We can’t wash dishes, clean pots/pans, silverware, or glasses. The kitchen is now useless.

On top of all of that, we chose this place because the pictures showed numerous beautiful beach views from the deck. Upon arrival we found the sand dune has been raised about 15 feet (and has been this way for years), so you can’t even see the beach now. This especially sucks, because we have a totally disabled special needs child with us that requires 24/7 care (another reason why we decided not to eat out) and can’t go out on the beach.

I tried calling (and texted)  the 2 listed property managers to report the plumbing backup (no answers) and messaged the host through the app (no answer). The rest of the house is in need of major attention as well. Doors barely open/close, bedroom doors not latching, ceiling fans not working, etc. 

I am not very familiar with Vrbo policies. I am also a host (99% Airbnb), and mind-blown at the level of neglect and misrepresentation for this listing.  How should I handle this?",1682,249,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/17b7c9y/beach_house_from_hell/,2023-10-19 01:38:21,Airbnb

Vrbo,Those who use both or used Airbnb. Questions,"Hi all,

Long time landlord but new to STR. Just put my new house I built on Airbnb. It’s been a great success so far. The house is in a neighborhood and next to lots of business travel so I had been assuming vrbo wouldn’t be the best site to list it. Personally it seems like Airbnb would have the most people and few if any would use vrbo over Airbnb but how is the control over your property vs Airbnb. How is conflict resolution. 
Basically any advice from experienced vrbo hosts is appreciated.

Vrbo,"AirBNB host banging on door at 11PM + Other Crazy Behavior [Naples, NY]","
https://abnb.me/5L8w2RMbpEb

Stayed here for two nights, and let me tell you about this horror story. 

so after receiving multiple aggressive from John i started getting worried about this guy. But we were just about to leave, and there were more positive reviews so i kind of shrugged it off. 

“Hey guys, your cabin is now ready for you at any time... I note you're from NY... I typically don't accept any reservations within 50 miles of the 212 area code... BUT.... Your info says Colorado so you made it in... 
Hopefully you come with a Colorado attitude... I lived for two years in the City and grew to despise the entitlement and attitude... We are upstate... In the country.  Hopefully that's a fit with you guys... “

“It's only folks from Downstate are challenges... I dont know why.... I am deploying to Israel in  3  days and the  damned phone alerts on electricity usage are killing me.  PLEASE be kind and responsible. This place is a gem, but I am DONE with those from DOWN STATE.  You immediately brought that back to my attention. Enjoy they rest of your stay but please look elsewhere going forward”

Mind you, we are cooking (electric oven) and enjoying the xmas lights on the deck - totally normal power usage. 

John started calling at 11pm and sending messages that we were using too much power and he “could see the lights were on”. He showed up banging at the door at 11:15, screaming that we were using the lights and that “look around - this is the mountains nobody is using lights”. “All you city kids are so entitled.”    This goes on for about 10 minutes. 

I said ok and closed the door. He was aggressive, yelling and crying that he was trying to sleep and he kept getting notification about power usage. 

He called 15 minutes later screaming and left a voicemail that he was threatening to shut off the power if we did not stop using it. He called again and started screaming at me on the phone- and i could hear him nearby just screaming. He again started saying all you kids from Brooklyn are the same - mind you i have no idea what he is talking about and i am 32 years old, my wife is 40 and do not live in the city. He started screaming that he is sleeping and being deployed to Israel to fight for my freedom and that i should be grateful. 

I have voicemails, emails, and text messages from him

I have multiple pictures of a filthy house. 

I have pictures of electric hazardous and exposed live wires that are extremely dangerous 

No doors or windows lock, and you are unable to lock the door when leaving.  Bullet hole in a window. 

I have pictures of filth and dust. 

His tv is broken and unwatchable because the sound is broken - blown speaker. 

This space and furniture is in terrible condition.

That mattress was previously burnt

And then after 3 days past check out i recieved more threats and harassment. 

“You idiots poured BACON GREASE down the sink!!!!!!! WTF!!! I am going to come swinging now.....”

“How DARE you people..... You left the place a shambles.... Cigarette butts, the sliding door was broken, you used the firewood yet didnt pay Jacob for it.... He's an AMISH KID for goodness sakes... The tub looked like no one had showered for weeks... The cleaning crew charged me an extra $100!!!!!!!”

“Fucking New York IDIOTS!”

Again these are all false and retaliatory messages. Ive never had anything less then positive reviews left for me. I literally shower 2 times a day - i have a hot tub and maintain mine perfectly - when we got into his you could feel the biofilm and scum on the walls of the tub. Accusing me of a broken door when his front door, every window, and sliding door do not lock or are missing handles. 

John is absolutely rude, terrible, and violent. This conditions should be noted and i will be pursing this to the furthest extent because this is absolutely unacceptable.

I have been trying to deal with support but it has been extremely slow for them to respond or provide the call back as promised.

Vrbo,Guest had a wedding without asking,"I'll try to keep it short.     

Rented for two nights, 8 people max. Checked in at 3 on Sunday.  About 10:30 our neighbor calls my wife (she was traveling out of state) who then calls me.  Tells me that I need to get there ASAP and see what's going on.  I was about 30 min away so I jumped in the car and headed over.

Neighbor said there were at least 25 cars parked in the yard (we have 3 acres so not an issue), people smoking (it's a non-smoking property) and looked like a huge party.    While I was driving my wife was messaging the guy on the app.  He said it was his wedding night and ""whats the big deal?""  She told him that the cops were coming.   

Side note: our property is also a wedding venue but weddings are not booked through VRBO or AirBnB because of logistics, insurance, etc.  We make that very clear on the sites and he never said anything about a wedding or a party.

The cops won't come, they consider it a civil matter, but it obviously scared them because by the time I got there everyone was gone.  There was a really nice Mercedes in the driveway, but no people.  I could see tire tracks in the grass where a lot of cars had been parked.  

Inside was a complete mess.  Furniture moved around and clutter everywhere.  Nothing damaged, but the amount of trash was unbelievable.  They had been there just 7 hours and there were countless half drank Korean drink boxes (some kind of pink milky looking drink), 50 microwaveable Ramen cups, tons of styrofoam containers from takeout, empty Coke cans and beer bottles everywhere.  Plastic wrappers on the floor in every room, on the couches, counters. Everywhere.  They had used every piece of silverware and all the plates and bowls.

They hadn't spent one night yet, but all of the beds looked like they had been slept in and three of the four bathrooms were covered in make-up where girls were getting ready to go out (presumably).  There was only one suitcase left in the house, so I rounded that up along with toiletries and put it on the front porch.  I deleted their access code and told them to come get their car and their luggage and to leave.  

We haven't heard anything from them and we received full payment from VRBO this morning.  ",651,316,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/192ihoy/guest_had_a_wedding_without_asking/,2024-01-09 16:21:09,Airbnb

Vrbo,Considering doing VRBO/Airbnb in Detroit," 

I've  got a house in the Corktown/Woodbridge area of Detroit, Michigan (up  and coming neighborhood) and after a few bad experiences with renting  out to roommates, I'm considering doing Airbnb/Vrbo to help pay my  mortgage. I'm a pretty short walk to a lot of bars and restaurants, a  casino, and about a mile from downtown where the major stadiums are. The  house has a modern interior with recent renovations (gutted two years  ago). All that being said, dumb idea?

I've  heard the market in general is flooded and over-saturated, but my goal  is actually to just hover between only 10 - 25% occupancy throughout the  year. AirDNA has occupancy rate data for vacation rentals in the area  around 15-30%.",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/199uslf/considering_doing_vrboairbnb_in_detroit/,2024-01-18 16:59:10,Airbnb

Vrbo,I thought Airbnb was bad. Then I booked with VRBO.,"I have had my share of not-so-great experiences with Airbnb but in the end, they always came through, although you have to spend hours on phone with them.

VRBO seems 1000 times worse than Airbnb. We booked a vacation rental in Hawaii using VRBO and were eagerly looking forward to it. Once we checked in the house was in a horrible condition. It looked as if it was not cleaned between guests. There were roaches in dishwasher, hair on the floor, unflushed toilet paper, food particles all over the countertop, unclean/used towels. We immediately alerted the host and VRBO. We sent 30+ photos and videos of roach sightings. I was communicating with the host via VRBO chat so I can have record of everything. The host agreed that their regular cleaners were out of town and she doesn't know if the temp cleaners did the cleaning or not. The host said that she can't schedule the cleaners until the next one or two days. We refused with that resolution as we didn't want to stay in a dirty house.

VRBO said that they would provide alternative accommodation until the house gets cleaned. The host agreed to change the reservation to start on the next day so we don't be charged for that one night we can't stay. We left the keys inside the home and left the house waiting for VRBO to send us alternative accommodation details. We waited for couple of hours and had to call back as it was almost close to 10 PM. Keep in mind that we left the keys inside the house and at this point we don't have the keys to the vacation home anymore.

We called VRBO again to see what happened to our alternative accommodation. The new agent we spoke to says that what was told to me was not the standard procedure. They said that the VRBO has to confirm with the host regarding the 1-night refund. We told the agent that the host agreed to it on the chat and the previous agent told us they will find us alternative accommodation. The new agent refused to do anything as she was trying to contact the host to get 1 night cancellation confirmation. It was past midnight where the host lives so the host didn't respond. By this time, it was almost midnight where we were. The agent kept telling me that we can't get alternate accommodation. We informed the agent that we don't even have the keys to get it. At this point the agent said that VRBO can't provide alternative accommodation but can reimburse us for up to $150 and that we have to make our own booking. We were in Hawaii and there was absolutely nothing available for under $1000 a night. I don't understand how VRBO can leave their customers stranded in the middle of the night.

It is ridiculous that they offered $150 in the first place. What makes it worse that it came with so many conditions that it is impossible to get that $150. The requirements were that I need to book with Expedia or [Hotels.com](https://hotels.com/) or directly with the hotel. If I found accommodation on any other 3rd party website or any of the credit card portals, then they wouldn't reimburse $150.

It is beyond my comprehension how VRBO is still in business. We ended up cancelling the accommodation as the host couldn't promise the house would be cleaned in a timely manner as their regular cleaners were out of town. VRBO refused to help as they said that the host agreed to clean the house ""at some point"" during our stay. VRBO also said that they require proof of multiple roach sightings to consider the home unsanitary. I was only able to send 6 different roach sighting videos as every time I open a cabinet door or dishwasher, roaches run so fast that it's impossible to catch them on video. Apparently 6 sightings is not enough proof. Since the listing was cancelled, I can't even write a review.

I got all of my money back as the host agreed to cancel but we lost almost 1 whole day in our 10-day vacation and also had to spend \~5x the original amount to find last minute accommodation. I know there is nothing I can do now but just wanted to rant somewhere.",12,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/14z59sa/i_thought_airbnb_was_bad_then_i_booked_with_vrbo/,2023-07-14 03:37:52,Airbnb

Vrbo,"If a host cancels hours before, should VRBO find you a replacement at no extra expense, or should the listing have a 30 day public warning?","Right now, a host can cancel last minute with no warning to future guests, and the guest that loses their reservation is left with useless VRBO chatbots and often extra costs. Should VRBO offer more to guests in these situations (with some maximum), or at least warn future reservations? Or what do you think should be done?

=====My details below, not needed to answer the question=====
Posting my details here in case others find themselves in a similar situation: booked 2 days before the trip, got ""instant confirmation"", and another confirmation + check-in info day before.

Hours before the reservation, after we landed, the host messaged: ""there was an error with the VRBO calendar syncing with their AirBNB calendar"" they accidentally double booked the place since ""both reservations were made almost at the same time""

So they cancelled ours since we booked slightly after the first group, said we'll get a refund, apologized, said we could try to find another place and warned hotels were very expensive. VRBO support was a useless chat bot. The only available place was 2x the capacity for 2x the cost and that was what we had to do. My hunch is there was no calendar sync error, they accidentally approved both and cancelled the cheaper listing. I know little change will probably happen from this post, so the hope is this post will encourage other users to post how unreliable the platform can be and maybe get the eyes of VRBO to make some changes.

Vrbo,"Go to Airbnb, you’ll have a much better time.","We were in France this past weekend and decided to spend the first two nights in a nice looking vrbo in Paris. We messaged the host 24 hours before check in to ask a question, but didn’t get a response. No worries, they might be busy. So we sent another message the next day, about 6 hours before check in time. Nothing. Waited a couple hours and sent the message in French this time, just in case. Still no response. Check in time comes and we’re at the building. No one is there, and the house we saw in the pictures certainly wasn’t there either. We had also still not been told how to check in. It was at this point we knew we had for sure been catfished. We were suspecting that’d be the case leading up to this moment but had hope since the listing seemed legit with reviews and since the host was listed as a trusted host.

So we do the first thing anyone would do and called vrbo. We give them the listing details and our reservation ID and they say there is no reservation listed on our account. They then put us on hold and hang up. So we call back and go through the same process with a different person, and the same deal happens. They insist we stay on the line though so they can try and contact the host. We’ve been on the phone for 30 minutes at this point and decide to take an Uber to a hotel while we wait. They pick up eventually and ask for the payment details which we send to them. They then inform us that they couldn’t contact the host (duh) and instruct us to go back to the vrbo and take pictures of it. We say absolutely not as we are now 40 minutes away from it and have all the details of our reservation and payment. It was as if they doubted the legitimacy of our complaint and didn’t believe we had been scammed. They let us know after about an hour and a half of being on the phone that they will email us soon about a refund and getting us a place to stay for the second night.

The next day comes and we haven’t gotten an email, so we call them again. As it turns out, the man on the phone from the day before had never opened a case and we were not getting any compensation, at least for the time being. So we ask for a supervisor and they give us the same crap, telling us to call the host and that they just can’t do anything to help us. We tell them this is bs and that we’ve now spent money on two new places to stay on top of the vrbo. They let us know again that they will email us with more information later on, which we are still waiting to receive. 

A friend of ours recently had the same catfish situation with Airbnb, and received more money back from them than they had originally paid. We’ve since learned not to use vrbo due to its poor customer service and policies and to instead stick with Airbnb and tell others to do the same. Shitty that we had to lose $300+ dollars and 3.5 hours of our trip, but I guess that’s what happens when you book vrbo.",4,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/12myg6s/go_to_airbnb_youll_have_a_much_better_time/,2023-04-15 10:56:18,Airbnb
Vrbo,California Beach vacation-weird rules?,"We’re booking a week over spring break near LA and put our 100% deposit down (refundable) on what appeared to be a beautiful home near the beach, dining and shopping. It has a beautiful pool in the back yard with a water slide. 

Received immediate messages from host requiring notarized signatures of all adults staying on property. Received list of rules.  Host stated she’d send our contract about four weeks (after refund period) before we arrive. 

This set off alarm bells. I’ve been renting AirBNB and VRBO for ten years and haven’t ever seen an intentional delay so I asked for it. There were additional rules in contract:

Am I unreasonable that these rules seem…weird:
Pool won’t be set warmer than 78 degrees. 
No guests on property at all. 
No activity in backyard before 8am and after 10pm. 
No loitering, standing, etc in front of home that may make neighbors notice you. 
On checkout we have to:
Pull laundry and place into bags. 
Vacuum and sweep entire house, clean all of the hard floors, clean and wipe down all of the bathrooms. Be out of house no later than 8am. 
Violation of any rule will result in immediate avoidance of contract and tenant will be removed from property. 

UPDATE: I canceled. Host said “I’ve never had anyone cancel because of this before.” I replied back because she doesn’t usually send until after cancellation period.  I pointed out discrepancies in listing vs contract.

Vrbo,Host increases price after check in ,"Hello, my husband and I booked a cottage for his birthday. The listing says sleeps 20. In the fine print it says the nightly price is for 12 people and there is an additional charge for $25/night afterwards. 

When we made the booking we put down 8 guests and 1 dog and the cost was $3300. Then the host messaged us saying that the price we saw is only if we are staying for a week. That the nightly rate is higher if we stay less than a week. We thought it was odd but my husband went ahead and booked it at the increased price of $3800. 

The day after we checked in 4 of our friends decided to join us bringing the group up to 12 people. We then received a payment request from the host for $450 stating that we brought 4 more people than we had paid for. 

So we called VRBO and said we shouldn’t have to pay because the listing says the base price is for 12 people. However they are siding with the host. 

Am I crazy or is this a bait and switch twice in a row? I am an Airbnb super host of 5 years and have never seen this happen before. Is this normal for VRBO? Are we in the wrong? ",412,84,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1edo8ei/host_increases_price_after_check_in/,2024-07-27 19:19:53,Airbnb

&#x200B;

* Set all future dates to unavailable and only open calendar for available dates
* Set a maximum length of stay for certain check-in days. I can maximize revenue when I don't allow guests to book two Saturdays as part of a 8 +night stay).  I'd like them to book Fri to the next Saturday but not the Saturday after. So I have implemented a max length of stay starting on Sat to be 7, Friday is 8, Thur is 9 and so on.
* provide a discount for length of stay other than 7 nights. For example, I want to provide a discount for six nights, or five nights.

&#x200B;

* Is the 8% commission deducted from the rate I have set? It seemed like it is charged to guest.

VRBO used to be better than some others but, anecdotally, since their Expedia acquisition several years ago fees have gone way up.

I realize this may be very difficult to find (impossible?) since the major players *do* perform a valuable service of at least surfacing the properties for me as a renter to select from -- most property owners don't have a website or any way of the public reaching them, and search results are all dominated by big players.

Vrbo,Never Book VRBO - Damage scam,"Breaking my 8 year Reddit lurking streak to warn people away from VRBO.

I booked a VRBO in Chicago for a group of friends in June. Conversations I had with the host before were normal and the place had excellent reviews (only 9 total though). To start, I had paid extra for early check-in and late checkout. The property used a timed door code (a specific numeric code for a set period of time) and the host clearly forgot to adjust the timing on the door code because neither my early check-in OR late checkout worked (my group was locked out of the property). Not a huge issue and the host refunded the extra I had paid for this.

The real nightmare began 3 days after we left. The host texted me, accusing me of significant damages (blood, holes in wall, destroyed mirrors, etc). Thankfully, I had taken a video of the entire property as we were leaving (for this exact situation) and I asked him if he could send pictures of the property to compare to the video I had taken. He didn't respond. I got the feeling then that he was trying to scam extra money from me and decided to drop it when I mentioned I had proof in the form of a walkthrough video.

3 weeks after this, I received a message through VRBO app where he quoted me 975$ in damages and a charge was placed against my credit card. I spoke with VRBO at this point who assured me the charge would not go through until a full investigation had occurred. I even sent an email to the VRBO support person at this time (at their request) with my proof video (which I was told over the phone was sufficient at that time). Unfortunately, I was still charged 975$ a few days later when the charges went through.

I have now been fighting back and forth with VRBO and have called them 3-4 times. At my last call, they informed me that they had been in contact with the host by email and BY EMAIL THE HOST HAD ADMITTED THE CHARGES WERE A MISTAKE. I asked for a copy of this email, but they told me the communication was private and they could not send me a copy. VRBO has never been able to reach the host by phone (obviously dodging calls). It's now been over a month with proof that the VRBO host ""mistakenly"" charged my card and VRBOs solution has been to repeatedly call the host. VRBO support has told me that they cannot refund the money and must rely on the host to refund the money (I have 0 hope that the host will do this).

I spoke with my bank and thankfully they are working to refund this (but still have not received). I was also told that this is not a unique situation and to cancel my credit card so that the host cannot charge it again. Basically, that this was a form of fraud with unauthorized charges against the credit card.

All this to say, please do not book VRBO, even if the property has good reviews. Support is not able to help you and cannot stop the host from fraudulently charging your card. The host, apparently, has free rein and can charge your card whenever they want with whatever factitious charges they can make up. I used AirBNB for a decade before this with 0 issues (and a 5 star guest rating). Not to say AirBNB is perfect, but certainly a better experience so far.

Vrbo,Do Not Book With Vrbo Unless You Like a Gamble ;),"So I am adding my drop of warning to the ocean of similar stories on Reddit, X, Facebook, Tripadvisor, and elsewhere in hopes that someone might read it and avoid the sad and frustrating (and expensive) ordeal we're going through.

Right after we booked, we started to get a bad feeling about the host when he asked us to communicate off-platform, and stopped responding on Vrbo altogether. 

Some new reviews popped up on both of his listings, and all of them were horrendous. People never getting into an apartment at all after arriving, people being forced to pay $800 on some outside app in order to get the keycode, etc.

We called Vrbo to report what seemed like scamming or fraudulent practice, and to get a refund or a replacement booking.

Vrbo asked for screenshots of our off-site conversation, reviewed his reviews, tried unsuccessfully to reach him via phone or email, etc. They escalated the case to fraud investigation and de-platformed the host, but they refused to give us a refund or different lodging.

They said we would have to wait a month, go to the property, try to check-in, and if that didn't work then call them from there for help. Since we'd be traveling to a freezing city at the end of November with a small child, we of course could not risk that fiasco and we booked a different place (thanks Airbnb) we could count on.

Fast-forward a month, a few days before checkin, and Vrbo sent me an email with the ""address"" to my booking (but no apartment # etc.)... It was 6 km / 4 miles from the listing location. 

Still no responses, ever, from the host. 

I called Vrbo from the airport, reported the above, and they tried again unsuccessfully to contact the host. That customer rep was the 2nd or 3rd in many hours of phone calls over this month to say we were eligible for a refund, but no refund is given and when I inquired about that after we were home they say the person must have been mistaken.

Vrbo says it's between us and the (completely unresponsive, de-platformed) host.

PS I have tried disputing the charge with my Barclays credit card, but they proclaimed the charge was valid and I had to go through Vrbo or the host if I wanted to keep seeking a refund. 

Based on the infinity of stories I've read now online that are nearly identical to ours, I am pretty sure we're never getting our money back. I hope there's some slight chance someone reads this early enough (like I didn't...) to not make the same mistake.

Vrbo poses as a hospitality company, but they are merely a Craigslist type of website, that posts everything from everyone indiscriminately, and is not accountable for what happens between hosts and guests. 

They told me as much several times, when I tried to question their lack of accountability. Be warned, if possible.

Vrbo,VRBO ALLOWS HOSTS DELETE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! Beware of Balsam Lake Ontario Sand Beach “Welcome to Castaway Beach “Clean shallow water.,"Don't mind me – I'm just here to post a review that I know will be deleted by VRBO hosts. Hoping it helps some folks save their money and book elsewhere.

**VRBO Details:**

>Listing: Balsam Lake Ontario Sand Beach “Welcome to Castaway Beach “Clean shallow water  
Location: Kawartha Lakes, ON, K0M 1N0 Canada  
Host: Peter

It’s clear why this property isn’t listed on Airbnb—Vrbo seems to allow reviews to be deleted, and that's exactly what's happening here. Although the listing says there are 18 reviews, only 10 are visible and all from 2023. The rating has dropped significantly since my booking, likely because 8 negative reviews have been removed. I'm sure mine will be deleted too, but I’ll be posting this elsewhere where the host can’t control it.

I booked this place for a bachelorette party and was deeply embarrassed before even stepping inside. The outside looked like a junkyard, garbage everywhere, broken appliances and tarps covering god-knows. Inside, none of the light switches work and most of the lamps had blown bulbs with no replacements available. The property has three fridges, but only one is functional and free of mold. Bedding isn't provided, which wasn’t mentioned in the booking details or by the host, so I had run out and buy bedding for eight beds which is not cheap.

The beach area was just as bad. The volleyball net is on the verge of collapsing. The sand is unkept to the point we had to rake it ourselves. The outdoor furniture could use a clean, we didn't feel comfortable unless we used our towels. Also, the beach and water aren’t private; there are neighbours right next to you.

I’ve stayed in so many rentals and this is the most disappointing experience I’ve ever had—so much so that I’m try to get a partial refund and reimbursement for the bedding, but the host has stopped responding to Vrbo.

Please save your money and disappointment—book elsewhere.

–––

**Update:**

VRBO customer service is just as disappointing as this stay. I reached out to them twice during my stay, but they were unable to contact the host. However today I called customer service to follow-up, and they *apparently* were able to reach the host while I was on a brief hold.

They informed me that no action could be taken because the host refuses to provide a partial refund or refund for the bedding, claiming the bedding was mentioned in the listing (I have screen shots proving this is not true)—VRBO customer service then advised me to resolve this issue directly with the host and provided me with this contact info.

However, upon arrival on 8/29/2024 it became immediately apparent that the property did not meet the advertised or confirmed accessibility standards. The doorways were too narrow to accommodate a wheelchair, and the bathroom facilities were not accessible, making it impossible for me to use the property as intended. Due to these deficiencies, the property was not usable, and I had to seek alternative accommodations, causing significant inconvenience and additional expense.

Check-in was supposed to be tomorrow (Thurs).  I received the additional confirmation email with check-in instructions, building code, wifi info, etc. on Monday.

Yesterday morning (Tues), I received an email from VRBO stating that my reservation had been cancelled.  No reason why, no other info, just cancelled.  I immediately went into the app and messaged the host asking what the hell was going on, as it's only 2 days away.  The host's response was, ""I didn't cancel it. I have the listing on another platform don't worry I will accommodate you, VRBO does some stupid things sometimes.""  Uhh okay....?  Then he asked me to reach out to him via email instead of using the VRBO messaging system, which of course is a red flag but I went with it since I was in a panic.  He gave me his email address in little segments, since VRBO blocks it in the messages if you type it out in full.  Here's how the rest of the conversation went...

> Host:  Do you have the original amount you were supposed to pay per night on your email?

> Me:  {sends screenshot of reservation details/cost breakdown}

> Host:  If you want I'll take $1200 USD cash, it'll save us both money.  I'll have the cleaner meet you.  If you're uncomfortable with this then I'll send you a link on airbnb to book it but then they add all their fees and stuff.

That was a huge red flag right there...I may be dumb, but I didn't fall off the turnip truck yesterday.  By this time, I was messaging with VRBO customer service on the side to see what they could tell me.  The host told me that he didn't cancel, but the CS rep said that the host did indeed cancel the booking and it wasn't a system glitch.  They said that all he needed to do was relist the property and I could rebook.

> Me:  You can't just reactivate the original listing?

> Host:  No it would have to be through airbnb now.

> Me:  {Sends screenshot of CS chat}

> Host:  No he's wrong my account is frozen.

So he was clearly lying.  There's no way I'm gonna take some rando's word for it, fly off to a foreign city, hand him $1200, and assume that the trip is gonna go as planned and he's gonna honor this shady-ass ""agreement.""  In any case, I wanted to see what else I could find out, so I asked for the AirBnB listing out of curiosity.

> Host:  For some reason it wouldn't post the link right away.  {link added} It takes a couple days to verify it.  Don't worry though, the dates are blocked.  I don't have anyone else staying with me.  {Includes screenshot from AirBnB app showing that local requirements have been met and phone number has been confirmed, but ""The listing details seem similar to another listing with recent issues or warnings"" which seemed weird to me}

The link didn't work yesterday, but today it shows the listing under a different host name than the one on VRBO.

Anyway, I don't know what the hell is going on here, but this whole thing was more red flags than a Soviet parade so my BFF and I scrambled to find something else last-minute.  It cost us another $500 which sucks, but at least we found something and we won't have to sleep in a cardboard box under a bridge or some shit.

Why would this host cancel and lie about it, then pull the weird cash offer thing?  This is totally a scam, right?

Vrbo,Warning for anyone with this future problem,"We just had a bad experience with vrbo. Generally it’s been fantastic.

We booked a rental and two days in we saw a roach. Figured it happens it is common in the area. The next day we saw more around the fridge and it turned out they were German roaches.
The host sent pest control out. We thought it was better until the next day roaches were all through the house. Adults, nymphs etc. we told the owner we were leaving, wanted a refund and we agreed on a $1000 refund for the remaining days. 
The owner is he next day said vrbo was being ridiculous and that they told him the fastest way was to give us the refund through Zelle. He said he would, IF we wojld give a five star review.

That sounded fishy so we contacted vrbo. We only had one picture of a nymph since they move so fast, but send it to them and any correspondence that happened outside of the app.

Long story short: vrbo said they cannot do anything. While it is unethical to request a five star review for a refund, those disputes are between owner and tenant. They will not get involved.

Since we did not have more roach pictures (we did have a text from the owner saying they were still roaming the house days later), they  could not do anything.

The host has now said no refund since we would not give a five star review, and now has also filed an insurance claim for damaged property in the front yard (there wasn’t anything of that value in the yard).

So for anyone going forward (I asked the rep what I should do if this happens again):
Anything wrong, document and call vrbo the moment it happens.
Take lots of pictures of you can (or I guess videos of those roaches are too fast).
They said to work with the owner but if the owner seems nice then turns into someone hard to deal with, not sure what to do there.

Vrbo,Red flags on VRBO?,"So there are a few red flags with this VRBO listing that is getting confusing for me....

I'm new to using VRBO. I booked a home for a large party through VRBO and was planning on paying in 2 payments. There are no reviews on this listing, however the host is a ""Premier Host."" Then I received a message from the host saying that it was not possible to process my payment with my credit card for booking. They then sent me a ""lodgify"" link for payment. Because I was feeling sus, I searched the address online and found that it was a property that is on the market currently.

I first called the real estate agent on the listing. He verified that it is an active Airbnb listing and the name of the property manager is his client.

Then I called VRBO to try and 1) verify if this listing has had people book in the past and 2) if it was shady to get links to third party sites.

The agent told me that this is actually a legit way for property managers to receive payment because VRBO will take the booking fee but the rest may need to be done on their third party site. The property manager gave me his website information ([https://www.sunnysidegetaways.com/](https://www.sunnysidegetaways.com/)) and his personal phone number through VRBO messaging. But when I asked for a phone call, he asked to keep all messages on the secure VRBO messaging app.

So it seems like there are some red flags that have legitimate answers for them? But I'm still feeling iffy about the third party payment and not sure what to make of his website and not wanting to call me.

Vrbo,A few questions for my first potential time booking on VRBO,"Hi everyone.  Just looking for your thoughts, as this is my first time considering VRBO.

How would you say their customer support is vs Airbnb?  I've found Airbnb to be pretty bad, insofar as you typically cannot get a live person for customer support.  Does VRBO seem to have the backs of paying guests, and making sure they are not being 'scammed'...that the listings are genuine...that once we arrive, the home will be as the host said it would be...as the photos have shown?

I'm going to be spending 2.5 months in Tokyo, and so once I arrive, I need to know that I will be set with my short-term accommodations.  Price, and location, are naturally a factor for me, and I found one place that seems to fit the bill.  However, while the listing looks nice, the host has no reviews, nor does the 'About the Host' say or show anything about them (beyond their name).  This automatically raises a bit of concern.  I'd obviously prefer to see reviews and a bit of info about the host.

I did write them asking a question or two about their property (and for the particular dates I want to stay), and while they answered my questions, not long after that I received an email through the VRBO system that says 'Payment request.  Your rental payment of $XXXXX is due on May 20, 2024 (i.e., today)'.   Now granted, maybe that was an automated email....maybe just the host's way of showing me what the total cost would be....but that too set off a bit of an alarm... that at this point we are simply 'discussing' the rental...that I was asking questions...and that I already see a bill asking for immediate payment.  

I always have my 'potential scam' armor on, so maybe I'm worrying too much....but anyway, I'm curious what others think...what their experiences have been with VRBO... how well VRBO vets their hosts.....how much of a risk I may be taking with a host who has no reviews or info about themselves...and if anyone out there has experience with their host not coming through on their end of the bargain, but that in the end, VRBO took care of the guests, refunding any monies lost and/or finding them other suitable accommodations.

Vrbo,Question about no pets allowed?,"So I am one that has very bad allergies to specific pets/their dander. A place I am looking to rent says no pets allowed in the description but that place is also part of a community of rentable bungalows. On the particular company’s website that rents these houses it says pet friendly. However, the VRBO description says no pets allowed. I messaged the host to make sure and they confirmed no pets allowed as well. 

In the chance that I get there and there is in fact signs that a pet has been in the place, what are my options? I am very new to all this and have never rented on VRBO or Airbnb before. I’m not looking to be a Karen, I just don’t want my trip ruined if I start to have an asthma attack ya know?

I’m all for people bringing their pets on vacation if they want, but I have to make sure I don’t stay in those places because the smallest amount of dander from the right animals can set me off. I’m just curious about my options if that ends up being the case. It’s happened at hotels before that had designated pet friendly and non-pet friendly rooms.

Vrbo,“Booking Query” Confusion,"Hi all - I’m new to using VRBO and trying to find a rental that my friends and I can stay in for a girls trip next summer. Many of the properties I had pulled had a minimum age requirement of 25 y.o., but since I’ve been able to previously reach out to AirBnB hosts to receive exceptions, I figured I would go ahead and send these hosts an inquiry as well. 

I now believe I have made an error in how I contacted these folks, because I heard back from one who opened the reservation up for me, leading me to get an email about a payment request that I am supposed to fulfill. I am truly just browsing properties right now as I want insight from my friend group as well, so I feel awful that I am potentially “leading on” these hosts if I am not actually set to book with them. Silly, but I feel bad. 

My question is, is there any way for me to rescind these “Booking queries” as I see they’re labeled as, and reach out to the hosts another way with my inquiry? If not, is there any penalty for me *not* going through with the payment request as my email is encouraging me to do - can I decline requests if others come through?

Vrbo,Bad Experience with Vrbo (Seeking advice),"Had a stay that was going okay in Brienz, Switzerland. The place was just as described, so no disappointment there. Everything fell apart at the end of the stay.

What happened is the host just unlocked the door and came inside. after a few of us had left the house Without any warning. No message, not even a knock. They acted completely oblivious that anyone was in the house, as they tried to just proceed to the upstairs where all our bedrooms where. It wasn't until my sister in law who was sitting right in sight of the door stopped them halfway up the stairs. Apparently a neighbor reported they saw people smoking ""5 minutes ago"" inside. The host aggressively accused and then continued to go through our things on the bottom floor looking for evidence or a smell. The host then admitted (these are their exact words), ""well I don't smell anything."" They left with no apology. Nobody on the trip smokes. We later found discarded cigarette butts on the front steps of the tiny alley, next to the recently occupied vacation rental.

Needless to say Vrbo was contacted immediately. COMPLETELY useless. Got pretty much nowhere after 4 disconnects and 6 hours on hold. They offered no help. Not even accommodations. Vrbo's own admission was it broke their Terms and Conditions for both host and guest. No refund offered. Nothing. They opened a ""case.""  What I find worse, the host is still listed and hosting.

Vrbo,I can't change the attractions that they (AI) post as things to explore in the area.,"VRBO has made numerous changes to their site that changed how my listed is represented.  I saw that it said my house is 4 bedrooms with 1 bathroom. It is 5 bedrooms with 4.5 bathrooms. It changed the box that should have said king bed to full. Pictures were missing. I've had this site for 7 years.  I had only 2 bookings last year and now I know why. AirBnb has taken up the slack. 

I was only alerted when I got an inquiry that asked me if my house really had only one bathroom. And it asked me why there weren't any photos of bedrooms.  I had several photos of each bedroom.

They added a feature ""explore the area""  It has a map, photos, and description of 5 places that  guests can visit.  I DIDN""T CHOOSE ANY OF THEM. One was a non-commercial  airport and another was a  membership only lake house, possibly competition with my waterfront house. But is was called a ""resort.""  That convinces me that they used AI to choose those ""attractions.""

I got the ""live chat"" for help. Its hard for me to call during working hours. They close at 5.  They never answered my questions. They just asked me  more and more irrelevant questions. ""What are your coordinates?""

""I'm not saying that those places aren't within an hour of my home. I'm saying that I don't want those sites featured with my listing. I would like to make my own choices of attractions that I would recommend, like the commercial airport that is used in our area, like the grocery store.""

"" Since you are only asking me more questions and not answering the questions that I have asked, can I conclude that you are saying that I cannot remove or change the area attractions that you have posted?""

The representative disconnected.

Vrbo,Unable to charge for smoking,"Hey all, could potentially use some help here. 

Just had a renter in my short term rental unit smoke for the 10 days they were there. I have all of their relative information. They paid through Stripe since I have price labs integrated. I have a strict no smoking policy with a $500 minimum fine in the description. They also ruined a few towels. For the extra cleaning, I was going to charge another $100.   
I went to charge their card on file at Stripe and it would not go through. VRBO wouldn't allow the charge on their site either. I looked up their bank and it seems that it's through Chime.   
It's a debit card, not credit, so I assume it won't go through if there's not enough money in the bank. I have pictures of the cigarettes and towels in the unit as proof. I've had this unit for nearly 2 years and never had a problem with a smoker. Airbnb would just charge them and they can dispute it.

I was completely taken aback because we've never sold out more than the odd week or so this far in advance, let alone multiple months in the summer. I go to check and realize that it's displaying as booked or blocked through airbnb. That checks out because usually if there is an issue with the calendar, it is Airbnb's fault.

I manually unblock everything to fix the issue and it seems to work but then I refresh the calendar on vrbo and now everything is just ""unbookable"" for some reason.

Does this invalidate the book with confidence refund? We only stayed aproximately 12-14 hours in the VRBO unit before leaving. All I am looking for is the 3 unused nights being refunded.

Vrbo,Another Warning About Horrible VRBO Customer Service,"Back in October 2023, I booked a large estate for 35 people in April 2024. The estate was on an island in the Caribbean, and I was in contact with the hosts for boat taxi transportation for weeks leading up to the trip. They were well aware of the group size.

Upon arrival, the estate had no running water of any kind, no AC as promised, no WiFi as promised, and the hosts lived on-site. Our only source of drinking water was bottled water that could be purchased from the hosts (which they ran out of within 2 hours). The hosts told us the water would be fixed in 24 hours... When the pump ship came around the next day. They'd forgotten to fill the reservoir tanks 🤯  I called VRBO customer service stressed the unhealthy situation we were in. I wanted help rebooking and for any extra costs of rebooking to be covered.

The agent stated they would open a case, but they weren't able to assist in rebooking our group. The agent called the hosts and they didn't pick up. The agent then emailed the hosts and told them our issues while we were on-site. The hosts confronted us and were pissed at us for not giving them time to fix the issues they could fix. Regardless, it was 100 degrees and it's not like the hosts can find AC units or help us rebook to a new place.

I had to rebook as many people as possible using Airbnb, hotels, and whatever else that was available. About 10 people still ended up staying at the original lodging due to no vacancy elsewhere. The hosts were onsite the whole time and clearly made us feel unwelcome now. My birthday party was totally altered.

After the trip ended, I called back VRBO and was told my complaint was closed because the host did not provide any comments on the situation. I was like ""so that should be a given that my side of the story is as described."" Instead, the agent said that only the host can give a refund and that VRBO can only reach back out to the host to pass on my complaints and ask for a refund. The agent said I'm only entitled to the amount of the original stay. Nothing for the extra amounts I spent on rebooking day-of.

Anyways, it's now been over two weeks of back and forth with Expedia Group / VRBO, seven different reps that I need to explain the situation to each time, the same protocol of VRBO reaching out to the host, never getting a response from the host, and then VRBO agent stating there is no method to escalate internally at VRBO to get a refund. FINALLY, I got an agent that said they could escalate internally for review, but that best case would be a refund for the original VRBO amount. No refunds for extra amounts on the day-of bookings. At this point, I've chalked it up to a lesson learned and to be happy with whatever I can get. Fingers crossed this internal escalation actually does something.

Vrbo,Cleaning fees?,"Hello everyone. I recently stayed a place a couple weeks and it was an okay experience for the most part. It was mainly a way for me and a small group of friends to reunite and enjoy a weekend out.

Anyways, I had paid a refundable deposit for some amenities, though we weren't able to use any of them unfortunately but it didn't bother me that much. I noticed after 2 weeks or so I hadn't gotten my deposit back and asked the host, and later vrbo support. Host responds saying we left his house a mess and keeps half the deposit ($150) as extra cleaning fee. Now I left behind any of my friends did so I took responsibility on the dishes we left in the sink but I thought $150 extra was kinda extra (considering he charged a min. $50 extra) and he made it sound like I trashed his entire house.

This was my first time on Vrbo and never had any issues with airbnb or whatnot but host seems strict on the fee and vrbo support provided no help. I was wondering if someone could fill me in on Vrbo or perhaps help me out? Thanks

Edit: Overall, I don't think host was trying to pull a fast one on me and maybe just happened to hire some pricey cleaning service that were displeased by the extra dishes. It's def something I would watch out in the future. I ended up accepting the payment and moving on, no point on bothering the host knowing they won't budge.",9,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1dve0hx/cleaning_fees/,2024-07-04 18:37:48,Airbnb

Vrbo,Absurd damage deposit? ,"I'm a guest staying at a condo in a ski town for two days and was required to either pay a non refundable $119 for Property Damage Protection or pay a $5,000 refundable deposit. I chose the $5,000 deposit because I'm a mellow middle aged guy staying alone to go skiing and just sleeping here. I'm wondering if this mandatory insurance or deposit seems unethical to anyone. I imagine most guests would not want to or have the means to carry a $5,000 charge on their credit card. Furthermore, it was a charge, not an authorization, so if you booked weeks in advance you will be paying interest on your credit card until you get the refund. It seems like it extorts the insurance payment from guests. The booking defaults to paying the insurance. Does this profit either the owner or management company? It feels wrong to me. 

I will also note that while the condo has a fantastic location and is a good value, it would require a small disaster to do $5,000 in damage in this place. It's a 1 bedroom condo the size of a hotel with a mini fridge kitchenette, sofa, king bed, and 2 old TVs. You could destroy all appliances, furniture, and the floors and still have money leftover. It would take a fire or plumbing issue to get up to $5k. 

As an aside, the welcome sheet doesn't have the world ""welcome"" anywhere on it. It is simply a list of violations and penalty charges. Don't take out the trash, $100. Unauthorized pet, $500. Over 4 guests, $75 each per night  Etc etc. 

I'd like the community's honest take on this. I do a lot of VRBO and Airbnb and this one just feels excessive. ",6,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1b2v2ks/absurd_damage_deposit/,2024-02-29 07:59:25,Airbnb

Vrbo,Had to cancel VRBO stay (renter) & lost $5k.,"Just curious of others thoughts on the inflexibility of the situation. We had a stay planned for next month 10 max guests (6 adults; 4 kids (3,3,5&7)). Our niece (12) now needs to join us for the week due to a change in her camp schedule. I contacted VRBO and they said no exceptions could be made to allow the additional guest (I offered to pay any additional fee). So we had to cancel and lost 50% of the cost. The host loses 50% and might not be able to rebook (or they might and may make out more on the situation - maybe they are ok with the situation?). It just seemed so inflexible and VRBO just stated policy and they didn’t have a way to contact the owner directly so there was nothing that could be done.

Plus the high fees and lack of allowing the annual subscription (and instead, charging my side 8% rather than the 3% in the last), have me looking for alternatives.  I also have my own home which is on airbnb and doing gangbusters. Does anyone here have opinions on putting a VRBO type property on airbnb, or is there a good alternative? Thanks.

Vrbo,Never using VRBO again,"January of 2023, I booked a property in Austin for last weekend's eclipse, knowing that it was going to be a busy and expensive weekend. We put down the deposit for a place that was going to be for 16 adults and 3 kids. We paid the remainder of the fee in March. The booking was for April 5th - 9th. I was going to fly in a day before (the 4th), stay with friends and then pick up rented vans to ferry everyone from the airport Friday (again anticipating things being busy). 

On the evening of April 3rd, I get a message from the host that they have cancelled the reservation, refunded my money due to someone booking on a different site ""months before"" me. I had literally no recourse. Everyone in the party just bailed since there was no other places we could have rented to accommodate our group on such short of notice on such a busy weekend. Over a year of planning just gone. 

Now, if \*I\* had cancelled two days before the booking, I would have lost everything, but there's no punishment for a lister who clearly got either a better offer or just realized they could cancel it and re-list it for more money?

Vrbo,Is VRBO giving up?,"I want to start off by saying that this is anecdotal; This is my experience as a host on VRBO for almost 10 years now. I have 2 homes and I co-host 6 cabins in the Big Bear. Not only have the rentals significantly reduced but the page views are down tremendously. I get the feeling Expedia is abandoning it in favor of their platform. The Big Bear cabins are killing it on Expedia. 

What does VRBO actually offer that is any different from Airbnb now? They have pretty much adopted the same business model so now it's just as expensive to rent on that platform. Now it only comes down to user experience and I think Airbnb has them beat. I realize some of you are on the old model (pay per year) but that is not a choice for a lot of us. 

As a host, I'm constantly receiving scam inquiries. I never get them on Airbnb. When I receive a legitimate request, most guests have zero reviews. It's scarier for me to rent on VRBO. Airbnb vets the guest more. Again, this is my experience. 

If VRBO wants to get back in the game, I suggest not charging such a high %. Undercut Airbnb and their ridiculous 12% guest fee.  They used to be the top dog, then Airbnb kicked them in the pants and they decided the best thing to do is copy Airbnb. I remember when it was just a marketplace. They connected you to the host and then they were out. I honestly think that model would kill right now in this economy. People want to take trips but they are sick of all of the fees.

First time using VRBO. I booked a 2 night stay in London a few weeks in advance. I never didn't hear from the owner at all in that time and found it a bit odd but didn't think much of it.

Day of reservation I send a message through Vrbo chat asking for instructions. Complete silence. 1 hour until check in and I'm starting to get a bit worried, so I call.

I call and she tells me she'll send it. I arrive at the property right at check in and nothing. I call her 5 times and she doesn't answer. So I call the third party.

They finally get a hold of her and I call her again. She tells me to ""wait until someone walks in the building and follow them in. Put your luggage in the basement and go to this address (like 4 blocks away or something) to pick up some key.

I try to follow someone in, but the building manager gets angry and kicks us out. Call the owner again, and the building manager overhears us on the phone and ask if we're talking with Airbnb. We hand her the phone and she starts yelling at the Vrbo host.

We booked the following house months ago,  paying in full and having a chat with the host owner who seemed very nice at the time.

VRBO policy does not allow booking stays to arrive same day and we were informed that they would only find us place for one night that had to be booked thru either Expedia or hotels.com or we were on our own and they would not assist with any difference in price if we booked anything except from these sites.

The host who cancelled our reservation,  knowing these rules, then attempted to get us to book with one of his ""buddies"" thru AirBnB so they could pocket the difference.

Vrbo,Cancellation issue,"I booked a property for a few night vacation that will take place in a few months. The posting said that I had 48 hours to cancel for a  full refund. 

Immediately after I booked, I sent the host a polite email with three specific questions about the property.  He did not respond within 24 hours, so I took this as a bad sign and cancelled my reservation well within the 48 hour window. 

VRBO said that the host is responsible for returning  the funds and that I should contact him. They gave me his phone number. I sent him one text message asking him to confirm my cancellation. He did not respond. However, he confirmed the cancellation through VRBO. 

VRBO returned the service fee, but the host hasn’t returned my money, which was listed as a separate charge on my credit card. 


I sent him two other messages through VRBO asking him to refund my money. He did not respond. I told VRBO and they did not seem to care. So, I filed a chargeback request with my credit card company.  I have no idea what this guy’s problem is. I was polite and I followed his cancellation policy even though I think it’s kind of an unreasonable policy. 

I noticed the property has been reposted for the same dates as mine but now at a lower price and with no cancellation refund allowed. 

Questions:

1) is there some reason he is being non responsive (other than him being a jerk)?

2) does the fact that he has reposted the property with no cancellation refund allowed matter for my purposes?

3) is there anything else I should be doing to make sure I get refunded my money?

The other property is a downgrade, but honestly still the best option we have and the host offered a discount.  So I said sure, let’s do it.  She said this is great and that she’ll send me the check in details on the day of my check in.  Never updated my reservation with the new property or anything.  

Then today I got a notification that my original reservation was switched from June 1st to November.  

What the heck is going on?  This all seems weird and fishy and unprofessional.  I’m thinking maybe she is trying to do this VRBO under the table so cancelling/switching the property on me doesn’t impact her rating?

Vrbo,Left stranded on the door step,"If I could give zero stars,  I would for this train wreck of a company. 

We booked the following house months ago,  paying in full and having a chat with the host owner who seemed very nice at the time.  

When we arrived in Edmonton,  a location to meet for our decentralized family of 7 who all live 4 or more hours in different directions, we were informed that the host had double booked the property and who then promptly cancelled our reservation with us on the doorstep. 

VRBO policy does not allow booking stays to arrive same day and we were informed that they would only find us place for one night that had to be booked thru either Expedia or hotels.com or we were on our own and they would not assist with any difference in price if we booked anything except from these sites.

The host who cancelled our reservation,  knowing these rules, then attempted to get us to book with one of his ""buddies"" thru AirBnB so they could pocket the difference. 

Do not book with this company or if you must,  avoid this host and property in Edmonton:

Vrbo,Poor Reviews so Switch to a Management Company ,"My reviews are not that bad that I have on my house that is located out of state however, there are some 4.0 star reviews and a lot of 5.0 star reviews putting the average at about 4.7. This does not allow me to be a super host and the reviews that are listed as 4.0 have very nice comments.
It’s frustrating because even if I do a major remodel and have 10 five star reviews in a row, I still do not get very far towards the progress of super host. Another words once you get down below super host it’s very hard to make it back if not impossible. 
My question is, if I switch to an outside company or have a friend list it, will the review process start all over?  If I list with a friend and then maybe a year from now switch back to myself will it go back to the original listing that has the 4.7 star reviews. I have approximately 30 reviews and there’s really going to be no way to get to super host status because every five star review increases it maybe just a little bit.

We are just about to post our cottage to VRBO as I've heard that this is better than AirBNB to prevent 'wild' or weekend crowds and will try to focus on weekly (and longer rentals). Thoughts on this?

Also, are there any 'scams' that we should be aware of / look out for when renting out the property? 

This is all brand new to us and we'll be listing in the next day or so but would like to do some final research to ensure.

Place is in a cottage town that basically banned STR except for specific commercial zones, but we see tons of AirBNB and VBRO listings in our neighbourhood there...so it seems it's more complaint based if someone has an issue with renters.

Vrbo,How to handle reviewing this guest,"I’ve been hosting on VRBO and Airbnb for a couple years now. I host an upscale guest house for couples. Our most recent VRBO guest was the worst we have encountered thus far. 

After the initial booking, he did not respond to any messages I sent through the app. He was working with our concierge on some plans, so I asked the concierge how they were communicating. He said iMessage, so I texted the guest to say I was trying to reach him via the app. No response. 

The guest canceled two bookings he made through the concierge, less than 24 hours before the events, so there were cancellation fees. The guest also requested laundry service (he asked my wife in person — so this was not communicated via the app). 

Upon checkout, there was food in the rug, a small hole in the wall, and a broken decorative wooden carving. Despite my (unanswered) message telling the guest he could pay for laundry service via PayPal or cash, he did not leave payment for the laundry. The concierge confirmed he also did not pay the cancelation fees. 

The guest also apparently bought and used a grill on the property, which is specifically against house rules due to wildfire risks. I do not have proof of this beyond the fact our house is within a few meters of the guest house, and I could smell the food grilling. He also used a bathmat underneath the grill (it is a diatomaceous earth mat, so not necessarily flammable - but I don’t know) and I could see an indentation from what I assume was one leg of the grill and a bit of ash on the mat. The edges of the mat were also a little curled, presumably from the heat. 

The first contact the guest made with the concierge was to request marijuana. The guest left behind some delta 8 THC gummies, which are legal in the country where I host, and some psilocybin chocolates, which are illegal here. 

I submitted extra charges requests for the laundry and cancelation fees via the VRBO app. After a few days, the guest messaged me (through the app), saying he intended to leave a five star review and saw a payment request that he wondered might be a mistake. I explained the charges, and he made the payment. 

So far, he has not submitted a review. I’m not sure how to proceed. If I rate him, it was overall a one-star experience. Most guests let me know if they break something (the hole in the wall, the wood carving) or create a mess (food in the rug); this guy simply left. He was careful to cover the evidence of the grill. I know he broke this house rule but cannot prove it. The drugs he brought onto my property and left behind were illegal. 

I have, in the past, had some  guests who were not great, and I simply did not review them. But this guy…I feel like it’s my duty to warn other hosts. If I review him now, before the 14 day window closes, I think he is likely to leave me a bad review. Then again, I have a 5-star rating now and would write a reply to a negative review if he leave one, so I don’t think one negative review will hurt much. 

Hosts, what would you do? Guests, what do you think? Thanks for any input you can offer.

Vrbo,Same day cancellation- no refund issued,"I will do my best to explain this in as much detail as possible- it was my parents rental so I’m going based on what I know from them and the emails my mom has showed me. 
We live in St. Louis. They live in South Carolina. At the beginning of June they made reservations for July 13-19 in Kirkwood MO. My mom had over a dozen emails with the “host” and everything seemed fine. The day that they were set to arrive my mom let the “host” know that they would arrive in town early and just to let them know when the property would be available for check in. The “host” told my mom that it should be ready for 1 pm, if not then by 2 (this was around 11 am). At approximately 12:30 my parents got an email from the “host” saying that they had to cancel the booking because the owner of the property died?!? I mean anything is possible but you’re telling me that at 11am everything was fine and at 12:30 someone was dead? I just find that very hard to believe. After circling around with VRBO they basically told my mom that the host was allowed to cancel and they can’t do anything about it. Somehow this “host” flipped my parents booking away from VRBO and onto their personal site. My parents are almost 70 so didn’t know that this was unusual. Not shockingly the “host” ghosted my parents and VRBO isn’t claiming any responsibility. 

Has this happened to anyone? Is there anything other than contacting the CC that can be done? We have emails from the “host” showing that my moms card will be refunded but it was obviously BS because they haven’t received a penny of the almost $1200 back.

Sure enough, pulled it off and saw the inside — I’m no expert but I didn’t think that’s what the inside of a smoke detector looks like. (Plus, that little switch on the back on ‘ON’ when I found it)

Called VRBO that night when I found it, sent them these pictures, and was told it might be a ‘temperature device’ lol what? They said I’d have to call the police to verify. Told and sent them the link where you can go to buy this exact one, and they said the same thing.

Called the next day, got disconnected 3 different times until I got a guy named Mario, who was THE BEST support person I’ve ever talked to (VRBO give that guy a raise fr). Got my money back in full and extra money to cover my stay at a hotel. And they banned the listing!
[VRBO team apparently was impressed with my detective abilities, call me Sherlock]

Notified the police, they came out to report it, and I left. It’s been a ride 😮‍💨

Moral of the story: Look around your place and look for stuff that doesn’t seem right. VRBO policy does not allow indoor surveillance devices, Airbnb does (I believe only in ‘common areas’) - also, maybe just stay at a hotel instead

Vrbo,Host threatening additional cleaning fees - reasonable?,"Hi,

We paid $Xk/night for a large group to stay in a 2500 sq ft luxury airbnb on the east coast.  It included a $600 linen and cleaning fee.  The house truly was beautiful and right on the beach.

The host sent us an email asking us to clean the house at 10:21pm the night before checkout (at 10am the next morning).  After checkout he sent an email asking if we had read that email and that they are ""finding a lot of trash and spills in the house"" and that ""I should have a dollar amount from them \[the cleaners\] soon on the cost of the extra work done by them.  I hope it goes without saying that I would rather not back charge for anything.""

The host claims he only charges for the cost of the cleaning, but $600 is already pretty high?  The house is not even that large?

I asked for pictures and an itemized list of what was dirty.  The pictures he sent are:

1.) toothpaste on a vanity sink2.) food splattered in microwave (there was no microwave cover, although we did use paper towels and it's not that bad)3.) Unused roll of paper towels, olive oil bottle, bread, 2 water bottles, and some plastic grocery bags on kitchen counter4.) Toothpaste on another vanity sink5.) 1/3 full trash can not emptied6.) Cooktop not cleaned (some oil and debris on it)7.) Couple small splotches of food or something on the a wall8.) 2 solo cups accidentally left in a corner

While these are a number of pictures, this seems like minimal mess to me?  Yes, we could have thrown away \*all\* the trash, but it honestly takes like 20s for his cleaners to dump the stuff on the counter into the trash if they want to throw it away..  Also, is it normal to ask your renters to clean the bathroom vanities of toothpaste when they have already paid a $600 cleaning fee?  I asked him for an itemized list of how the cleaners spent their time and labor and how this adds up to more than $600?  Am I being a jerk here?  I have NEVER been assessed additional cleaning fees despite staying at 20+ airbnb and VRBOs over time...

As another data point, the owner on the day of check-in sent a 1500 character text to me about how the previous guests were filthy and he was assessing an extra cleaning fee and made a nearly explicitly threat to us that he is sad to assess more fees but sometimes he has to...

If he does assess us this fee, should I fight it or is there a way to dispute it in VRBO?  I looked up the price of full cleaning services in his area and they are like $250 for a similarly sided house, and they clean the microwave!",5,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/15n0ut7/host_threatening_additional_cleaning_fees/,2023-08-10 03:32:02,Airbnb

After booking it I received confirmation emails from both Vacasa and Vrbo. On my credit card I have one charge from Vacasa for the reservation and another charge from Vrbo for a service fee. I now understand that Vrbo advertises the property and Vacasa manages it.

Vrbo,Reservation confirmed but property manager doesn't have info,"I'm not sure what to do here. My family is planning to go to Costa Rica after Christmas. We reserved a condo for part of the trip. 

On Tuesday, I received an email and message in the VRBO inbox from the owner with property and check in info. The local property manager was copied on the email. The property manager asked me to contact her on WhatsApp. 

I reached out to the property manager. She stated she doesn't have our reservation, and the property was recently taken off VRBO and she doesn't have access to that system. She suggested that I reach out to VRBO. She also referred to ""other owners"" in the email, but it isn't a clear message. 

This happened Thursday, I haven't been able to get in touch with the owner. I called VRBO yesterday, they tried to contact the owner and told me they would call today. They didn't, but I called later in the day. The representative assured me I have a confirmed reservation. However, she seemed unconcerned that the person on the ground (who is responsible for getting the rental ready and actually checking us in) is saying she doesn't have what she needs to do that. I'm also not convinced the rental isn't double booked through another platform, but that might be paranoia. 

She stated that if we get there and don't have a rental, to call and they'd figure it out. I'm going to be traveling with my parents and 2 small kids. I don't want to travel 12+ hours only to learn we don't have a place to stay during the busiest travel week of the year. 

I still haven't heard from the owner. I'm not sure what to do here. I've already paid for the rental and can't afford to book another rental if I'm not guaranteed to get a refund, and VRBO was pretty clear that right now, theyre not willing to refund me. 

Do I have any option other than waiting for the owner to contact me? Does the info I got from the call center make sense?

Update: the owner never did get back to me. After almost a week of calling, I finally got my case escalated to someone who had the authority to help, and VRBO canceled the reservation and is refunding my money.

Vrbo,Would it be odd to request no linens?,"One VRBO we stayed at the sheets and blankets smelled really bad. So bad that my wife was gagging from the smell and we had to put them in a garbage bag and tie it up. We went to the nearest Walmart and bought sheets and a blanket and pulled theirs off and put new on.  Ever since then we bring our own sheets and blanket. And if space is tight at least both sheets so I can have a barrier between me and their blanket. 

I now have a fear of sleeping between sheets anywhere....hotels, Airbnb, VRBO. Instead of just tearing off sheets that the owner puts on, would it be weird to request the beds blank? Same with towels and wash cloths. 

The first thing I do when I get to a place is pull the sheets off and make the bed with my own. I take my sheets home but leave theirs as if we used them. It would reduce a whole lot just skipping that step, but I don't want to seem weird by asking for no sheets on the beds when renting a place.",4,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/12o71dp/would_it_be_odd_to_request_no_linens/,2023-04-16 12:34:53,Airbnb

Vrbo,Advance re: damage insurance,"The title should read Advice (not Advance)

We have been renters with VRBO for going on 20 years.  We travel with dogs and have always left the homes in better condition than what we found them.  I always pay for the damage protection just in case and never had to use it.

We rented a condo in an area that we've rented before without issue.  This trip, we needed a larger unit.  I found a 2 bedroom on VRBO and the reviews weren't great (property run down, owner difficult, etc.).  The reviews for the same property were much better on AirBNB so I took a chance.

The unit was like what the VRBO renters reported.  Months of dust built up all over the condo and old spills and splatters on the closet doors, walls, etc.  Despite charging a $125 cleaning fee, clearly, the cleaning company wasn't doing a thorough job.   A previous renter had marked all over the back of the couch in pen (assuming a child) and owner didn't bother to replace/clean I guess.  It just had an overall feel that the owner was kind of cheap on services - which was reflected in the VRBO reviews of past renters.

Despite this, I let it go, and just decided to enjoy the trip.  The bedding was clean, the bathrooms were passable and the kitchen was usable.

We did a walk through on our exit and texted the owner on our exit as instructed.

24 hours later,  I receive a text that the cleaning crew found a cracked window in the master bedroom.  The owner stated it ""must have occurred from the inside"".  We never even opened the blinds to the window in that room.  Our dogs were only allowed in there to sleep crated and the bedrooms doors were all closed if we had to leave the unit.  I'm not sure how the owner can attest to the fact we caused this damage 24 hours after we left.  I think we would have heard a window crack if it had occurred during our visit.  Surely, our dogs would have been injured from it.  The crack is pretty extensive.  Our dogs weigh 32 and 37 lbs - I can't see them having the force to cause the damage the owner photographed without us noticing.

The only reason I'm dubious about this is the general state of the property (especially the cleaning portion) is pretty lackluster.  I'm not accusing anyone of lying, but I can't imagine this type of damage occurred without our knowing it.  Especially since the dogs weren't allowed in the bedroom when we weren't present.

I gave the owner our travel insurance plan number and he sent a quote for $50 to replace the glass.  I get the feeling, he wants us to just pay him and not have to go through the travel insurance at all.

We have no problem paying it, I am just wondering what others have done in this situation as I've never had this happen to me in a VRBO.  I normally takes lots of pictures with time stamps of units the day I arrive and the day I leave, but I only took photos of the dust and gross stuff to share with the home owner if he asked based on my review.  It's his word against ours I guess.  The owner only has photos taken a day later and I only have photos of dust and grime.

If you do need to use the travel insurance, is the renter expected to pay for it and then file the claim or is the rental owner expected to handle it?  According to the insurance policy company, the owner normally files.

I am planning a family vacation (in the US) next year for a very specific event in a specific location. I need more space and convenience than what a hotel can offer and I need it for a minimum of 5 days, maybe more. I couldn’t find anything in the area I’m going to that suited our needs on AirBnB. Everything was already sold out. However, I did find a place on VRBO that definitely meets our needs, it’s in the location we need and it’s available for the dates we need. The price was also reasonable compared to most things on AirBnB for that event so I booked it. They required full payment up front. I’m ok with that. The guest cancellation policy states that a minimum of 2 weeks notice is needed for a full refund. I’m good with that too. 
My question is, what’s VRBO’s policy for hosts cancellation? 
What recourse do I have if the owner decided to cancel my reservation and then jack the price up (they are definitely under priced for the event, IMHO)? Yes, I know I’ll be able to get my money back because I booked on a major CC. TBH, I’m more concerned about my family missing the event that I am about getting my money back. 
Should I make a “back-up” reservation in the event the owner cancels on me or tries to raise the price or price gouge?

Vrbo,Will my structure be deleted from Booking.com affiliate partner websites if I delete my structure Booking.com ?,"Hello everyone,

We own a guest house in Italy, but we decided to be published only on AirBnb, plus our own website. This summer we decided to open on Booking.com as well; so we did and instantly got published on thousands of other websites. I did some researching and found out that:

""When you join Booking.com, you’ll benefit from extensive advertising. You **may** also appear on one — or more — of our 17,500+ affiliate partner websites""

Also reading froom Booking guidelines:

""**Can I remove my property from an affiliate website?**

It’s not currently possible to opt out of this service""

&#x200B;

Now, 6 months have passed and we got dozens of reservations from AirBnb, a few directly from our website and an absolute **ZERO** from Booking. And since we opened on Booking, the number of reservations coming directly from our website kinda dropped, I'm assuming that the reason is because we now appear on the infamous google second page, while before registering on Booking, we listed as the second result in our local zone (first one was AirBnb).

Of course we would like to stay on Booking, we know it could be a showcase (we're getting hundreds of views, despite no reservations). Maybe people find us there and try to get to us directly (maybe for a discount), BUT since we have to evidence on the positive aspect, perhaps it would be best to opt out of Booking completely, but we'd like to be certain that we will also be removed from affiliate partner websites as well. Do someone have some experience on the matter? Will we got rid of this websites?

&#x200B;

I know that zero reservations on Booking is weird, we think to have set up our listing well, description and price is equal to AirBnb and looking for our local zone, the price is ofter the lowest, we get a lot of clicks, still it seems like it is no use for us.

Vrbo,Anyone else experiencing cancellations this year?,I have 2 beach homes listed on VRBO and just received my fourth cancellation of the season.

Vrbo,Beware booking on VRBO,"VRBO has a very poor policy when it comes to renters and seemingly mostly cares about making sure they have a ton of listings vs. actually making sure the listing agents act appropriately 

(1) They put their own cancellation policy notes on the site, but most listing agents have their own leases with separate cancellation policies. VRBO has decided to let this happen even though it is incongruent and creates a bunch of problems (basically they just ignore the fact that you have separate leases and make it your problem).

(2) Because of this policy, VRBO does nothing when listing agents violate their own leases, essentially meaning you have to become your own arbitrator or decide to take the listing agent to court. Basically, you have no protection or recourse to the listing agent doing whatever they want, and when reporting this to VRBO they note its not their problem

(3) When you then decide to note that you would like to warn others / review the location because of repeated issues with a listing agent, VRBO will refuse to let you note anything (if you cancel on their site you cannot leave a review). Be warned, the reviews are always going to be overly positive because of this. There is no way to get accurate information through VRBO so please do not rely on reviews.

(4) When you dispute any of the above with VRBO - they will ignore you completely. When you go to dispute via your credit card provider, VRBO will fight against you (they actually have marketed to listing agents about how successful they are arguing against credit card refunds).

&#x200B;

DO NOT book on VRBO and spend your time on AirBNB. AirBNB actually went above and beyond during the Covid19 crisis whereas VRBO left us having to research lease law, dispute with our credit card, and spend over a year just trying to get a partial refund as stipulated in the lease.",15,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/nruuyf/beware_booking_on_vrbo/,2021-06-04 02:51:42,Airbnb

Vrbo,Trying to figure out if I did something wrong as a guest - house was set up as a shared living space,"I thought that Vrbos were supposed to be dedicated living areas, separate from other guests or the host. A couple weeks ago I had one with my wife and teenage kid where we got the basement, the host had the upstairs, and the only thing separating us was a wide open staircase connecting the downstairs living room to the upstairs. The house rules even had comments about coming upstairs to use their oven and laundry if we needed. Host was 100% living there as we could hear them upstairs. 

The listing for the property just said ""you'd have the basement while we have the upstairs"", and made no mention of there being no actual barrier between us. We didn't even have locks on the bedroom doors. We got there late on check-in night and stayed because we didn't have anywhere else to go, but checked out right away the following morning, since it was so uncomfortable to be there, and I didn't sleep a bit. We tried contacting Vrbo support but they wouldn't allow us to cancel the remaining nights (I was fine with paying for the one night we did stay).

Was I wrong in thinking that there needs to be some form of separation between host and guest?",6,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/16mcikc/trying_to_figure_out_if_i_did_something_wrong_as/,2023-09-19 00:38:19,Airbnb
Vrbo,Turning everything into a rental economy is awful,"I booked and played a tour with a  band. We got three different VRBOs and a Turo. Turo is AirBNB for vehicles.

We  no longer use AirBnb much because, if only staying for one night, the  fees add up to more than the stay. We didn't use Uhaul/Alamo/Budget/etc  because none of them had a large equipment van for a reasonable price  (Uhaul is cheap per day, but when driving 1000+ miles at .79 a gallon,  that adds up). We used a Turo van last tour, and it was nice. We used  Turo this time despite dropping down to less equipment, which we  shouldn't have done. We avoid hotels because many don't want to rent to  more people than the number of beds and will call you out if you show up to a 2 queen room with five dudes.

A few  years ago, as soon as you booked an AirBnb or VRBO, you got messages from the  host giving you every detail about the rental. They had a book that explained everything inside. With these VRBO rentals, on a sliding  scale, we had hosts that neglected to even give us the door code until  we got there, realized we still didn't have it, and had to call them  after midnight to get it, or seemed annoyed when we asked for  the wifi,  or the listing was simply... Not good. One of them had a long passive  aggressive list of rules including ""this is not a homeless shelter."" I  can understand why that needed said having been there. It's no longer  about someone with a spare room renting it to someone who doesn't want  to stay in a hotel. It's slum lords renting by the day. The reviews  don't allow pictures.

The  vehicle rentals are similar. The first vehicle we had was cancelled at  the last minute. The host had 30 4-5 star reviews but 15 cancelled  reservations, and those renters can not post a review. I expect they are  on multiple platforms and cancel when a higher return platform books an  already booked vehicle. They insisted the car had been crashed, which  would mean every third rental has someone crash a car. I doubt any side  hustle person renting extra cars would keep doing it if that's the case.  We rebooked a more expensive, further away car, meaning we're paying  more to drive further for pickup/return. The host we got the van from  was some dude who rented slightly beat up older vehicles. That is his  side hustle. We rented a 10 year old van and didn't expect it to be  incredible, but 20 minutes out I realized the windshield was cracked.  These people don't inspect anything between rentals. I reported it to  Turo, through a non US based call center with canned responses, so I  didn't get blamed and the guy texted me  several times ranting about how he now had to take it off the market and  fix it because I told them. Like. Yeah, you rent something to people  for income, you rented it with a defect that could get someone in legal  trouble, the vehicle is your responsibility. I understand where the guy  was coming from, though. He said he makes almost no money on these  rentals. The gig economy has given either side of the exchange a worse  deal than traditional rental companies and takes most of the money in  the middle. Turo apparently is an insurance company first, not a rental  company. They make their money from what you pay for insurance on the  car, which comes out to about the same cost as the rental.

Tech  companies have turned the concept of personal property into a gig  economy where they take most of the money and offer nothing.",12,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/14x78bz/turning_everything_into_a_rental_economy_is_awful/,2023-07-11 23:30:30,Airbnb
Vrbo,"Has anyone sought reimbursement from a Guest or VRBO for damages, when the Guest did not pay for Damage Protection, and you did not charge a security deposit?","I have a one bedroom cottage/ADU that I built next to my house. It is reasonably priced for a college campus/downtown area. I have never had an issue in the past 10 years, as most of my Guests are in their 50's or older. That is why I do not charge a security deposit to guests. 

Anyway, I just had a couple in their 50's who had a mentally disabled small child that they adopted. It's been rough raising him, as they told me when chit-chatting when they arrived. Anyway, the child scrunched my custom-sized, and fancy blinds that cover a bay window that is about 7.75' long. 

The Guests obviously knew that they could not hide that, since I can see the window from my house. They offered to go to Home Depot or a Target to replace the blinds. Obviously, that would not remotely work. These are custom-sized, and high quality blinds. My appliances and household items are all very stately, and not anything like IKEA offerings. 

So, I'm sure VRBO will be no help here. I thought I liked VRBO way better than AirBnB, but AirBnB's AirCover is wayyyyyyyyy more Host friendly. Why does VRBO not offer that? Maybe they can step up and match AirCover, and then advertise that on TV commercials- as it would only help Guests that get screwed by Hosts that cancel bookings/have disgusting conditions, and help Hosts whose guests destroy their residence.

It seems the only recourse would be to contact the Guest, and ask for them to pay what they can. They don't seem to have much money, so that's not going to happen, and there is a zero percent chance I would take them to small claims court. I wish VRBO would take care of stuff like this, and pay out a claim to make me/us whole. If VRBO wants to go after a Guest for payment that's fine.

Vrbo,"Issues with booking through VRBO, lease with realtor outside the platform","I just want to share this in case someone have had the same experience or is looking to book through VRBO. I use Airbnb frequently in Canada and around the world, this was my first time on VRBO. 

TL;DR Booking through VRBO is not really booking through VRBO and booking description lacked key information. 

We are a family from Canada, 7 adults and 2 young children who were looking to book for 5 days in Cape May, NJ. We found a property on VRBO that looked perfect. After sending in a request, a realtor reached out via email(outside the platform, that’s new to me but it mentioned a realty company will reach out if managed by one). A few red flags that made us cancel and book something else through Airbnb:

1. We needed to sign a lease outside of VRBO through the realtor, we learned this after receiving the first communication from the realtor.

2. The total on VRBO upon booking did not include the VRBO fees(? Close to 400CAD), it was only the amount on the lease. No matter how we calculated in USD or CAD, with different acceptable exchange rate we were still off by $500CAD, no big deal over 5 days but still annoying. 

3. The realtor requires a security deposit ‘’cash’’ meaning we needed to send a cheque or a bank transfer.. From Canada, which would have costed $100 in fees we would not retrieve. Not only that, but they would only send it back via cheque if everything was ok(no explanation of what that means) after 2 MONTHS. Again as Canadians, we would have no recourse to get this money if they decided to keep it/if cheque was lost in the mail. I’ve never paid a security deposit other than with a CC. 

4. The keys for the property need to be picked up and dropped off at the agency.. 25min each way from the house, so 1h added upon arrival and departure for keys and can only be picked up between 10am and 5pm. Delays in traveling? Too bad. 

5. Nothing was provided: no toilet paper, no dish soap, no trash bags, no rags, no all-purpose cleaner, no broom(for a beach house..) and of course no linens and towels which is common but not generally for such an expensive rental. Again no big deal, but still not convenient. 

6. We contacted VRBO for clarifications who then reached out to the host(realtor). VRBO said the realtor assured them there would be no issue for the keys and deposit with a cc.. But then the realtor emailed us again to reinstate deposits are cash only and keys are to be picked up at their agency. 

We could have accepted most of those points except the keys and deposit, that’s too much money possibly lost and time definitely wasted for a 5 days family trip. Overall disappointed with our experience on this platform, I’m sure there’s great hosts on there but I wouldn’t recommend it.",5,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/11ztlp8/issues_with_booking_through_vrbo_lease_with/,2023-03-23 18:53:04,Airbnb

Now I have the dates correctly modified but in the price summary the total is still the same and the night rate has gone up proportionally to make up for that one night that was deducted.

Customer service said to tell the host to modify the second installment to match the new price or to refund one night. Host said that when he changed the dates, he received a pop-up saying financial adjustments would be made accordingly.

Vrbo,owner contacting previous guests,"I'll try to make this clear. This may be kinda complex but all relevent

I am in a condo association that has a ""1 rental manager"" for the whole association requirement.  A few years ago our rental manager quit and the association said we could go on our own.  A few of us found some body (\*A)  that provided very good on site management.  He had his own direct site as well as airbnb and vrbo.  He also rents out other units in the seasonal community.  They are all shown on the same personal page.   It has been a very satisfactory experience.  

As an owner, the renters don't know me from Adam. 

Last summer the association found a new rental manager to handle all the units.  As a result of timing of contracts we stayed on with \*A and some went with the new manager, with the expectation that everybody would be transitioned on the upcoming November 1. 

Seeing as how some clients have used his personal site, next year we won't be on there.  We will still be on that site.  I'd hate to miss out on any repeat clients. 

Would it be appropriate to ask him for a list of all the tenants and mail them a letter discussing the new management configuration?  I would also say that he continues to provide rentals and the transition was not at all related to his performance but that our unit would be on airbnb/vrbo and the new personal site for the new manager?

Vrbo,How to Sell VRBO," I have now bought and sold multiple AirBnb/VRBO properties, and have finally figured out how to do it without affecting anyone’s ratings, and without upsetting guests too much.

Before closing, the buyer creates a new AirBnb and VRBO listing, but does not activate or list it. The buyer must provide a property manager’s cell phone number to the seller. The seller sends the buyer a draft list of all future bookings (more details below).

At closing, the seller (1) sends the buyer a complete list of all future bookings (including, for each reservation, the dates of stay, what site was used, the total the guest pays, the predicted payout, guest names, and guest contact info), (2) makes the property hidden or inactive for future bookings, and (3) sends each future guest a message by every means possible:

Hello,

We have sold (the place where you have a reservation).

You will unfortunately need to go ahead and cancel your reservation, which will be at no cost and no penalty.

The new owner, (owner name), has your reservation dates blocked for you, and will charge you the exact same amount you paid. His/her new AirBnb and VRBO links for the place are below. Just give him/her a call at (phone number) and ask him/her to unblock the dates for you, and make your new reservation, at the same place.

Sincere apologies for the hassle - we did make sure not to sell the place except to someone who was willing to honor all existing reservations, but we still know it’s a pain!

Thank you,

(prior owner name)

P.S. Please note that if this message is sent via AirBnb or VRBO, you will not be able to see the new owner’s phone number after you cancel your reservation, so please make sure to write it down before cancelling!

(AirBnb link)

(VRBO link)

Then the new owner double-checks that all existing reservation dates are blocked, and that the price for them is currently such that guests will pay the same total amount. The property manager will then be inundated with calls from future guests.

The vast majority of guests will go ahead and cancel and rebook without complaint.",1,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1202naa/how_to_sell_vrbo/,2023-03-24 00:10:55,Airbnb

Vrbo,Subject: Seeking Advice on VRBO.com as an Additional Platform," 

Hello everyone,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out to this community as I've been a long-time user of Airbnb for my vacation rental, but I'm now considering expanding my presence to include another platform alongside Airbnb. Currently, I receive most of my bookings through Airbnb and my personal website, The Bee Cottage ([**https://thebeecottage.co.uk/**](https://thebeecottage.co.uk/)).

In my quest to explore additional options, I came across VRBO.com and noticed that some properties in my area are listed there. However, during my online research, I noticed that many of these listings had relatively few reviews, which raised some concerns about the effectiveness of VRBO.com for my specific location.

I'm curious to know if VRBO.com is worth considering as an additional platform. From what I understand, VRBO.com operates on a guest-paid model, where the 10% fee accumulates towards the annual subscription fee. However, I'm uncertain about what happens if the guest fails to pay these additional fees. Will I be responsible for covering the outstanding amount, which I estimate to be around $500 or thereabouts?

I would greatly appreciate it if any of you could share your experiences and insights regarding VRBO.com. I'm particularly interested in understanding how the platform works and whether it has been beneficial for your vacation rental business.

Please accept my apologies for any inaccuracies in my calculations or understanding of VRBO.com. I'm still in the process of learning about this platform, and your input would be immensely valuable.

Thank you all in advance for your time and any advice you can provide.

So now I better not shop too seriously, because the price could get jacked up when someone knows I'm interesting.

UPDATE:  
Took the leap of faith. booked airfare, rented a car. i told my wife i had several hotel options in case we showed up and people looked as us like we had 3 heads. or, worse, yet, we show up and the homeowners look at us like, ""oh, you poor people. we get at least 3 of you a month and now you're out a huge chunk of change and nowhere to stay. bye, bye.""

at any rate, it all worked out. our hosts are, in all appearances, owners of the property. we're in and on our 2nd day.  having a great time. thanks to everyone who weighed in and helped us feel better, worse and more grounded.

I have been in an AirBnb since last August.  I got a new job so my son and I will be moving closer to my new job (about 30 min away).  There are very few home rentals so I decided to find another Airbnb rental. I was looking for a rental from Aug to Dec.   I found a property that would be great for us on Airbnb. I reached out to the host and spoke with her about a few thing.  I decided to book it but was blocked by Airbnb due to being ""high risk"".   I called them and they said it was because I was too close to the new rental (about 30 min away). I explained but they wouldn't budge.  The host also had it listed on VRBO so I figured I would book it there but had a few questions.
1.  It will only let me reserve until Oct 30 instead of the whole time.  Host says she doesn't have any other bookings and it shows available until I try to book it.  I'm getting a message that the system can't pull up prices.  Is this normal?

The VRBO changes include eliminating the $499 service fee cap for VRBO renters and also eliminating the $499 per year annual subscription plan for new VRBO partners. Related to the annual subscription plan elimination, anyone new to the VRBO platform is forced to use a pay per booking which equates to 8% (5% host fee + 3% booking fee). This puts any new hosts to the VRBO platform at about a 4-5% pricing disadvantage relative to existing partners who have, at least for now, been grandfathered in with the $499 a year annual subscription plan.

Vrbo,How Do I Get a Refund?,"Update: after we disputed the charge with the host and then VRBO and were denied, we disputed the charge with MasterCard. It took a while, but finally got notified yesterday that our dispute was valid and we received our refund. 

We had accommodations booked for three days in Vancouver. When we got there, we immediately got on our phones to find another place to stay. There was no way we were sleeping there; we fully expected to have someone come in while we slept to murder us. 
The VRBO was disgusting, and disgusting is such an understatement. There was a thick layer of grease over everything and it smelled like a deep fryer that hasn’t been cleaned in 15 years. There were personal items such as a loofah hanging off the bathtub tap, among all the other personal bathing items. The lighting in the bedroom consisted of two table lamps, one on a side table that was shown in the picture, the other one on the floor (it was also a table lamp).  The blanket was just one of those Costco fleece blanket, different than picture. It was just gross. So of course we are not eligible for a refund because it was after we checked in. We didn’t stay there and ended up paying more for a last minute hotel. We chatted with VRBO and they just referred us to the host. What do we do now? Can we still get a refund? As we have at every Airbnb, we paid a cleaning fee as well which is just ironic.

Edit: 

Spoke to the host, he got hostile and offered to only refund the cleaning. Spoke with VRBO and because the host admitted to living there, the chat person strongly recommended we call VRBO to request a refund. 
We called a few times, they first said it needed to be escalated and we didn’t hear back. Then we called back and we were “disconnected” so had to call back. Then they said we had no proof he was living there. We literally have the conversation that they can see with the host admitting twice he lived there. 

They said only the host can provide the refund. We are now escalating to MasterCard.

Vrbo,Charge for hot tub cover tear,"Hello all, 

Do not know if this is the correct sub to post this under but hopefully someone can point me in the right direction. My friends and I stayed at an Airbnb this past weekend and we had a fantastic time...no complaints. This morning, I was sent an email from the property owner with an attached picture showing the hot tub cover having two tears near the center fold. Even though we did not notice this during our walk through, we said that we would cover these charges. The issue is that the property owner may charge us $350-$450 for a brand new hot tube cover. The tear is only on the seam...no damage to the insulating material. I looked online and you can easily fix this with about $30 worth of material. After speaking with Vrbo, they said we can negotiate with the property owner and go from there. What are your thoughts? Would you charge for an entirely brand new cover or do a patch? I find it insane to have someone pay for a brand new cover when its only the outer material that is ripped.

Vrbo,Why you should NEVER book through VRBO,"Context: recently booked a 2-night stay at a very nice apartment in Europe. We arrive for check-in and the place has a leak in the living room - the whole place smells terrible from the damp, and because of the moisture the place is flooded with mosquitoes (I mean FULL of them). We let the host know that there is no chance that we are staying there, that we need a full refund, and we leave the place right away to find a last-minute hotel.

That night, the host says that he cannot believe that we left the place, and that he was hoping we would be a bit more ""practical"" about the leak (ehh... excuse me? We are paying you almost $1000 a night, and you want us to be ""practical"" about the ceiling dropping water on us?). He declines to provide us a refund.

We decide to go through VRBO, and VRBO says that because we paid the host directly, they cannot do anything. Keep in mind that even if you pay the host directly, when you make the booking through VRBO they have a ""Book with Confidence Guarantee"" that if you read the T&C, they guarantee a refund if something like the above happens.

Well guess what - total BS. After 4 hours on the phone with VRBO over the last two weeks, VRBO says that they will not provide a refund. No one on the phone will say why we do not qualify for the refund, even if we followed the conditions required for a refund on their website to a T, and provided photo evidence of everything we highlighted - all they can say is that they cannot reimburse us.

TLDR... screw VRBO. Never book through them, they will not have your back if anything goes wrong. Most hosts also have their properties on AirBnB... book through them instead. Pay the extra few dollars that AirBnB might charge, it will be worth it. I am down almost $2K with no hope of getting it back.",2,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/x3kr7q/why_you_should_never_book_through_vrbo/,2022-09-01 22:36:29,Airbnb

Vrbo,Awful customer service tbh - wouldn’t recommend VRBO,"Tl;Dr I booked a place for 5 nights in Paris in May end of December via VRBO

This morning I got an email saying the owner canceled on me “for personal reasons” and refunded my stay 

The problem is - any equivalent place in Paris for the same dates is now way more expensive 2 months out (hence why I planned ahead!)

I called VRBO customer service to ask for some form of compensation for the inconvenience and additional cost I’m going to be incurring for the trip and all they would tell me is “there’s nothing they can do and that sucks but it’s not our problem” after literally an hour on the phone. 

The fact that an owner can cancel a stay months after a booking & leave a renter scrambling for an upcoming trip with no help from VRBO is absolute bullshit

Vrbo,Issues with stay,"Background. Made a reservation 2 weeks ago with very few options. From the get go we were not super excited about the listing, but we preferred a house instead of a hotel for our stay for various reasons.

Driving to the property (8 hr drive) to meet the 4 o’clock check in time. At 320 we still had no check in instructions, so we immediately contact customer support. CS gave us the direct number to host, they had not given us their number previously. We called and texted the host, on two separate numbers , they had read receipts on, and we could see that the text messages were being read. No response. At 6pm, two hours after the check in time, we finally got the check in code from host. Should have left there.

AC was not running, was over 100 degrees in the house. Host called us multiple times to apologize and tell us about the house. We were going to a festival. So we hurried, got ready and came home, fell asleep. 

More issues when we wake up. We notice there’s a plugged in camera that was not disclosed in the listing.

House is pretty dirty. Moldy food in fridge. Carpets have food on them. Just dirty in general. The host also messaged us and sent an additional charge request of $125 for “extra people.” House sleeps 6, there’s 3 of us here.

This was nowhere in the posting or payment details or in a recent email in which the owner claimed this deposit was explained. With this online booking, no exchange of cash was part of the agreement. After 2 hours of back and forth me trying to explain that this was not what I had agreed to, nor was it legal, they put me on the phone with the owner, a French speaker. He tried to explain that we have to pay this, and since my purse was stolen that day, and I had no cash on me, I could pay through PayPal. The idea was shady and I was having no part of it. We had been driving all day, exhausted and ready for bed. Evening is approaching. I finally reached VRBO on the phone, as their chat didn't work, and I explained the situation. The woman on the phone told me that the refund was being processed and they were going to find me another place. (Needless to say, that never happened.) After that, we left this remote village on (a stoney, winding mountain, 40 minutes from Porto), we drove into the city of Porto. Hour or so later, after VRBO reached him, I received this text from the owner: ""Hello Rachel. I am sorry. I think it 's à problème another vacationer. Please call. It s ok With the paiement. You can stay. It s ok. I am very confused."" VRBO then determined that we will be not be entitled to a refund, because the owner corrected his mistake, no matter that he broke the law by demanding cash deposit for check-in, and only admitted his “mistake” afterVRBO contacted him hours later. By that time it was late, we were exhausted and looking for somewhere to sleep. After being on the phone with a VRBO manager (3rd person I’d spoken to, each with different explanations) for 1+ hour, I asked to speak with his superior in order to escalate the situation, I heard laughing on the other end and then was disconnected. Apparently, because I had booked and then cancelled an earlier reservation at the same location, the VRBO people were confused and were referring to the previous reservation regarding the refund. The person at VRBO didn't know the difference between a cancelled vs. current, NOT CANCELLED RESERVATION. SO, after all, VRBO claimed that we needed to stay at the property after all this, and our leaving confirmed that we chose to cancel the non-refundable reservation. My only chance to get the money back ($411) is to contest it with my credit card company, which I am doing. Airbnb has a guarantee that if there is any problem at all with their property, checking in, whatever, there is an immediate refund, and I have experienced this 1st hand. Vrbo’s customer service is appalling. It goes without saying that I NEVER will use their services again. There are wonderful places on Airbnb and other more reputable sites. Don't use this service. VRBO clearly prioritizes its own financial gains, not the customers renting properties. It defends the owners no refund policy no matter how badly or illegally the owner behaves. This site should be cancelled by the better business bureau or other agency. DO NOT USE.",0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/vpvvti/do_not_use_vrbo/,2022-07-02 16:47:21,Airbnb
Vrbo,"VRBO hasn’t paid me for my bookings in months, you can’t reach them or talk to anyone and now they aren’t answering my emails or phone calls.","I had just gotten done talking to an Expedia group representative who apparently was my account manager. I shared with him the fact that I did think VRBO was superior to the other booking sites. Primarily because there’s insurance to give the host some measure of protection. 

I’ve had damages and issues with the other booking company and we all know who that is and they never protect you and I haven’t gotten payments for any of the issues. Even with proof on camera they go back to the renter and if the renter denies anything they go back to you and say sorry you’ll have to work it out with the renter. 
Horrible horrible horrible host protection so VRBO really has been my go to and my primary source of income as a rental property platform.

Fast forward shortly after speaking with my so-called account manager VRBO stops paying me. I’m on my seventh booking as I write this and have more reservations in place but they haven’t paid me since the beginning of the summer. 

Second week in July, I was changing bank accounts over to an LLC and they kept blaming everything on that. The site just keeps sending me W-9 forms which have been filled out over and over and over again. I’ve sent billing copies of my EIN federal form verifying names and numbers but nothing but more triggers to fill out the stupid form. Even the phone agents filled it out for me on their end thinking it was some technical issue on my end but that didn’t work either. It’s really a bunch of BS because the payments stopped coming a number of bookings before I even tried to change my bank account number. 

The helpdesk are a bunch of international people sitting at home answering calls and they have to email billing. My account had about 20 priorities before I ever got a single email from billing. The billing specialist couldn’t do anything and sent it over to the tax department. I have yet to hear anything from the tax department as days and weeks slip by. They designed it so no one can be reached directly and there’s no one to personally speak with so there’s an untouchable feeling, horrible customer relations.  

I’ve emailed and called my so-called account manager with absolutely not one response back. And I just wait and hope that they pay me because I live off of these funds and it’s getting pretty desperate now. I figured I’d start to go to social media and maybe the press and legal if I have to but it just feels hopeless. Not one word of explanation or feedback about what’s happening. The site just keep sending the W9 form to me and I just keep filling it out over and over and over and over and over again. No one knows anything in any of the departments and there’s no one to talk to and now they stopped answering my emails. I hate to think I have to get an attorney on this but maybe that’s what has to happen. 

I used to be one of their biggest fans and when things are working well and smoothly no problem but God help you should you run into any difficulties you’re on your own because you won’t be able to find a single person to help you or give a damn.

Vrbo,Question for VRBO Hosts - Best way to delete & re-list VRBO listing?,"Question for the VRBO host experts out there:

What's the best/cleanest way to get a fresh start on a relatively new VRBO listing that hasn't gotten any traction? As background, we have a good listing but it seems to be at the bottom of VRBO search for a couple months, and we've gotten zero bookings and reviews. Meanwhile have been doing well on Airbnb with 15 reviews and getting superhost status in the same time.

We're going to at least delete the VRBO listing and start a new one. But should we also delete the VRBO host account and start a new one (even with the same email address) for a pure fresh start? There are no reviews tied to the host profile, so don't feel like we're losing anything. But not sure if there are any drawbacks to a new host profile or if it will be flagged. Our goal is to get premier status by the next assessment period or two.

Relatedly, in 2021 VRBO announced a ""Fast Start Program"" for new hosts: [https://www.vrbo.com/.../vrbo-launches-fast-start-program...](https://www.vrbo.com/media-center/press-releases/2021/vrbo-launches-fast-start-program-to-fuel-early-success-of-new-hosts?fbclid=IwAR1vTndQDEOY5CEGe1V7TPk5T4isX5IdqnwFQs6PcRiBrdGYu6rZnBHruoY)

There doesn't seem to be any mention of that program currently. Not sure if it went away or if it operates behind the scenes. Anyone know about that and how it affects our plan of deleting and starting over.",2,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1108fil/question_for_vrbo_hosts_best_way_to_delete_relist/,2023-02-12 05:52:20,Airbnb
Vrbo,VRBO: Hosts beware of Guests that Violate House Rules,"We found out the hard way that VRBO allows guests to leave reviews even if they have broken the house rules and had their reservation cancelled after they check-in.  This is a big problem for Hosts who will get hit with obviously negative reviews if they enforce their house rules and then take the extra step to cancel the guests reservation.  VRBO's stance on this is that as long as the guest's review doesn't violate their ""review policy"" they will not step in to remove negative reviews from guests that go against everything they agreed to when booking.  We have escalated the issue twice with customer service to get it resolved as well as through Twitter with the same result, cannot remove review because it doesn't violate their policy, when the review itself is in retaliation for us intervening and cancelling their reservation for breaking the rules.

&#x200B;

A little background on this; Guest books our new cabin we listed on the VRBO platform (we have 3 other properties and we aren't new to VRBO or hosting).  We specifically state in the description as well as house rules that all parties and events must be approved by host prior to booking.  We also state additional guests are not allowed.  We check the guest in and everything seems normal.  The next day we receive a message from an Airbnb account warning us that our property is about to have 100+ underage kids from graduation drinking and partying later that night.  We were skeptical of this so we decided to stop by the property to talk to the guest and see if something was going on we aren't aware of.  The guest was gone and we noticed the house was completely re-arranged by looking through the windows as well as party streamers hung all over the cabin, disco ball hanging from the chandelier, all furniture surprisingly missing.  We decide to enter the house to take a look around since the warning message seemed to have been accurate for the most part.  We discovered 200 glow sticks, streamers were glued and stapled to the brand new wood walls of the cabin, furniture moved up stairs and pushed into side rooms.  The beds weren't even used and no personal belongings were even in the house.  The guests had basically checked in the day before, converted the house into a party venue and was preparing for something to happen later that night (checkout is 11am the next day).  We decide to reach out to VRBO and ask what the next step is because they have already broken the party house rule at this point since this was never discussed with us.  We also were not going to allow the property to get destroyed by potentially 100+ underage high schoolers drinking and partying there.  VRBO told us they would go ahead and cancel the reservation since we were not comfortable with the guests continuing to stay there and agreed to a 50% refund with customer service.  We also called the police to file a report and let police officers know when they showed up that the area may have a lot of people coming out to it tonight to party.  The guest received the cancellation request notice through VRBO and sent us a response back asking what was going on and that they needed to get their things.  They showed up with even more party supplies!  We had already moved their Karaoke/DJ equipment onto the front porch and started taking down their streamers that had left all kinds of marks on the walls from the glue and staples.  We explained to them that we didn't approve a party and that we received a warning that 100+ underage kids were going to be partying out there, whether the guest knew about it or not it wouldn't be safe for them to stay there.  The guest was obviously not happy and got their things and left.  A week later we notice the guest left us a review stating that the cabin was bug infested and how horrible of hosts we are for throwing their personal belongings in the front yard?  This was all in retaliation since they didn't even stay the night to have experienced some kind of non-existent bug issue or have personal belongings for us to somehow throw out.  We responded to the review explaining what had happened and that the review was obviously in retaliation for cancelling their big party that night.  After explaining this to VRBO customer service with pictures, police report etc... as well as the customer service that handles their twitter responses... we have unfortunately gotten absolutely no where to have the review taken down.  They do not have a policy that keeps guests from leaving reviews for breaking house rules or having their reservation cancelled for violation of the house rules.  Even reviewing the steps we took with VRBO they stated we did everything right after discovering the house rules were broken by contacting them and starting a case.  Guess this is a warning for hosts.

&#x200B;

TLDR:  Guest was planning a huge 100+ party for underage high schoolers.  Contacted VRBO to notify them the house rules were broken and VRBO cancelled the guests reservation.  Guest leaves a nasty review about the house and us as hosts.  We ask VRBO multiple times to have the review taken down because it's retaliatory and provide pictures and the police report.  VRBO will not remove the review because it doesn't violate their ""review policy"".  Guests can break house rules and even have their reservation cancelled to still be able to leave a review which will always be retaliatory.",13,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/oglqny/vrbo_hosts_beware_of_guests_that_violate_house/,2021-07-09 02:02:10,Airbnb

CustomerService,WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE,"Worst Customer Experience of my Life

	On July 8, 2013, at 11 AM, 
I had a scheduled flight to Singapore from Montreal with Delta Airlines.  Once in Singapore, I had purchased another ticket to Kuala Lumpur, with Air Asia, where I had scheduled business meetings during the day of July 10.  On July 11, I had a ticket to fly back to Laos, my hometown to see the love of my life and finally rest in my home after three weeks of being away.  At 1:12 AM, July 8, I receive an e-mail notifying me my first flight has been delayed, which consequently meant I was going to miss all the rest of my flights and have to reorganize EVERYTHING.
       Delta Airlines did nothing to find a solution on their own.  I had to call the company, again in the middle of the night, not even 10 hours before my flight, to fix everything…. to then be told there is a three to four hour waiting time to speak to a representative.  You can put yourself in the queue and they call you back when an agent is available.   Around 4 o’clock in the morning, I receive a phone call.  I am then connected to an agent and I ask her what are my options.   There were in fact NO MORE options to arrive in Singapore on the right date; I would have to leave on July 9.  Now this means I am losing the other plane tickets I purchased previously and I will not be able to make my meetings in Kuala Lumpur.  
All I really want is to get home, why doesn’t teleportation exist yet?
  Anyway, the agent said I could choose another final destination if I want, so we looked for other flights to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur or Bangkok… all cities I can get back to Lao from.
   I also proposed leaving from a new city, I could have driven to Ottawa and caught a flight from there.  In fact, there WAS a flight from Ottawa that would have worked with my previous itinerary, but NOOOOOO, Delta can’t do that for some reason.  Back to Montreal….  I asked to get a small reimbursement of 300$ to cover the tickets I am losing in Asia, NOT an option… BUT, she said I may be able to get a 50$ voucher, ok I’ll take it.
	FINALLY, after an hour on the phone of looking at every option possible, we find flights from Montreal to Bangkok the next day, and from there I could get back to Lao.  Great.
    I confirm the ticket and the line cuts.  I didn’t get a confirmation for the 50$ voucher though.  However, I get an e-mail at 5:55 AM from expedia saying my itinerary has been changed.  Looks good and official to me.
  I move forward and purchase my ticket to Lao from Bangkok.  All good so far.
  
I call back Delta to confirm everything is ok, because the line had cut, and I had not received an e-mail directly from Delta.  Once again, I put myself in the queue and they call me back a couple hours later.  This time it was a new agent.

NOW NOT ONLY WAS MY TICKET NOT BOOKED, BUT THEY NOW WANT TO CHARGE ME EXTRA BECAUSE I CHANGED FINAL DESTINATION, WHICH WAS NEVER TOLD ME TO PREVIOUSLY….. AND AFTER WAITING FOR 15 MINUTES, THE LADY TELLS ME I CAN’T EVEN FLY TO BANGKOK BECAUSE IT’S AGAINS THE RULES TO CHANGE YOUR FINAL DESTINATION.  So, we book a flight to Singapore again, leaving on the 9 and arriving on the 11 at 1:20 AM.  

BUT, I’ve already purchased a ticket in Bangkok to go to Lao.  So I have now purchased another ticket from Singapore to Bangkok.

ALL THIS WITHOUT ANY COMPENSATION OR ANY INITIAL EFFORT ON DELTA AIRLINES PART TO HELP ME.  I HAD TO DO EVERYTHING ON MY OWN, EVEN THOUGH IT IS NOT MY FAULT.  I AM NOW LOSING OVER 500$.

I will never be flying with Delta Airlines after this trip.

CustomerService,Booking.com Scammed Me Out of $500 – Avoid Them at All Costs!,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my recent frustrating experience with Booking.com to warn others and hopefully get some advice on what to do next. This company scammed me out of $500, and their customer service has been atrocious.

I made a car rental reservation through Booking.com with a pickup time at noon on August 4th. When I arrived at the rental place, I couldn't retrieve the car because there was an inconsistency in my booking information. Instead of my correct name, the reservation listed my last name twice. This mistake prevented me from getting the car.

The rental agency informed me that if the issue wasn't resolved within two hours, my reservation would be canceled. They mentioned that Booking.com would need to reactivate the reservation if it got canceled.

I later found out that Booking.com outsources car rentals to Rentalcars.com, a company with a terrible reputation. This was the first red flag, as their customer service is known to be unreliable.

I immediately called Booking.com support, explained the situation, and provided the additional documentation they requested to prove my identity. I was assured that the issue would be addressed promptly.

Despite providing all the necessary information, I waited for hours without any resolution. By the time I received a response, it was almost 10 PM — 10 hours past my booking pickup time and about 9 hours since my initial call to support. It's completely unreasonable to expect anyone to wait this long for assistance.

Given the lack of timely support, I had to make other arrangements for transportation, which was both inconvenient and costly.

I reached out again, requesting a cancellation and a full refund. Given that this issue was not my fault and the support experience was terrible, I believe this is the least they could do to make things right. The email support from Rentalcars.com sent me in a loop, with different agents sending templated responses that essentially ignored my previous emails and never furthered my inquiry. This added to the frustration and made it clear that they were not interested in resolving my issue.

This isn't the first time I've had problems with Booking.com. While their support staff is generally courteous, the company's policies and communication have consistently been ineffective.

In the end, Booking.com scammed me out of $500. This experience has been a nightmare, and I strongly discourage anyone from using their services.

Has anyone else experienced similar issues with Booking.com? How did you resolve it? Any tips on how to get a quicker response or escalate the matter? I'm seriously considering never using their services again and warning my friends and family to do the same.  


**TL;DR:**  
Booking.com messed up my car rental reservation, causing me to miss my pickup and lose $500. Their customer service was slow and unhelpful, and they use dark UX patterns to make getting support difficult. Rentalcars.com email support sent me in a loop with templated responses from different agents, ignoring my previous emails and not resolving my issue. Avoid them at all costs

CustomerService,Please help me to provide the best service.,"As a driver, I can tell you that all of the ""delivery"" jobs that I do - the amount that the company pays us barely covers gas. The following order took 30 min to deliver - the company paid a little over $3, and the tip was only $1.57. I seldom say anything to customers as I dont know their circumstances. The other night the customer was basicly spoon feeding me info - thus in order to make delivery I had to reach out to her 4 times, wait at the gate l, then wait at building door (again no code). I texted when leaving watehouse & was told to contact her at each point. She tipped $1.57
I politely sent a text asking that she provide this information so that drivers can ensure a safe, speedy delivery. She ripped into me, telling me to call my employer. Mind you, it was delivered to a complex that charges over $2200 per month. Kinda yanked my chain to think I was basically working for free so she could maintain her expensive lifestyle.
Though I realize that she was likely a guest , she definitely had the high and mighty attitude as she layed into me. My guess is that she knew she was in the wrong & and that's why she was so reactive to a simple requst to provide info up front so we could do a better job.

Some drivers get that people are struggling and may not be able to really tip. Truthfully we have bills just like everyone else & that why we are here. Some apps accept foodstamps and dont have the ability to tip. Some are single parents & paying a little extra is much more desirable then dressing the kids and lugging them all to the store, extra. Though I believe most just dont understand, then there are those who just dont care as long as they get theirs.

If your one of the ones struggling, I get it, been there done that. Good news though, with a little effort - you can still take actions that will make the delivery easier on the driver so they can quickly move on to the next delivery, and minimize thier time on work they are not actually getting paid for. You would likely be upset if payday rolled around & all they paid you was enough to cover your gas - right? 

1. Provide detailed information.
 Gate codes & building numbers are great! Yet to be honest building numbers are often difficult to find - and some apartments you litterally have to walk all the way up to the door to actually see the appartment numbers. No fret there is other info you can provide that could save a driver a huge amount of time. For example.... park near space number xyz, or near garage #xyz. Or next to chained off fire entry or dog park - N,S,W,E end of complex but on courtyard side, N of tennis court (be sure the landmark is viewable from the lot though or it would be of no use). This is especially important if in a complex with multiple phases and 2 or more apartments have the same number.
2. On foodstamps? I get it been there! Some customers have been awesome and put together snack & drink baskets that they put out when a delivery is comming. Just insure that what you offer wont go bad sitting out, especially in the summer. Honestly it make my heart smile when I see this because it tells me that the customer truely cares & believes in unity & community - these are awesome people!
3. If you prefer text or calls - or dont want your bell rang, cool just put it in the notes (no need to be rude if previous driver didnt - most likely a different driver doing delivery this time.
4. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND, you may order from one company, yet a different company does the delivery, so if a driver asks for some info - it likely was not provided to the driver. Its not a lot to provide the info again. Berating your driver & demanding the call there employer for the info - well I could write a book on customer service paybacks. I would never venture to where some take it - but it sure does provide an awesome night of cards against humanity - gig workers style & have me laughing for weeks.
5. Please also understand - we no longer have the luxury of confidently 100% trusting the mapping systems. I can tell you how many times it tells me to turn down an alley, takes me to the next complex over & says location is on the right yet Im next to a brick wall, or in housing communities where it takes you to an exit only gate & the actual entry is 2+ miles away

I dont kneejerk to anger on a no tip, I see it as karma rectification. However I found when providing info so customers can help drivers often results in personal attacks like the incident above. That does yank my chain for sure.

Saddly there is so much focus on fearmongering in the news & suvh that it creates an invironment of seperatisim and us against them mentalities. This O believe is one of the many ways that these beliefs have bled into everyday life for many.

I understand that not all drivers provide good service - but a lot of us go the extra mile to try to always put a smile on the customers face. We dont deserve to be treated this way. As a community - WE need to do better!",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/11rw71e/please_help_me_to_provide_the_best_service/,2023-03-15 13:21:17,Booking.com
CustomerService,Could anyone who works in frontline customer service share your experiences of receiving low-quality customer treatment when you are serving the customer at work?,"Hi, everyone. I am a research student at an Australian university and I really appreciate anyone who would love to share your experiences and participate in my survey.

The questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes to complete and it is better to complete using computers as you might feel more convenient to type and share your experiences in open-ended questions. Many thanks in advance. T\_T

CustomerService,Charter Spectrum Fail,"While trying to find the channel number for my 93 year old Dad to watch the Braves in his town, I had this hilarious/frustrating encounter.  Good thing for Adderall or I'd have thrown my MacBook into the lake...

You're connected with Kyla

  
Hello, my name is Kyla with Spectrum. I see you need assistance with channel listings. I am here to help. May I please have the first and last name of the person I'm chatting with?

*D\*\*\*\*\*\* is my stepmother. I'm trying to make a cheat sheet of channels for them. My 93 year old Dad wants to watch the Braves on Ballys but can never find the channel.*

  
Hello S\*\*\*! Thank you for reaching out to Spectrum today! How may I assist you?

*I do not have their spectrum login info or I'd look it up myself.*

  
That's not a problem I will be more than happy to assist you with this today. Do you have the account number?

*if I had that, I'd probably have the login info, wouldn't I? Sorry, I've already been through this on the phone and she sent me a link to login to see channels - I explained on the phone that I don't have login info to her also.*

*I entered address and phone number to chat bot - did it follow me to you?*

*They're 4 hours away and horrible at technology.*

*Again, he's 93 and she's 80.*

I completely understand where you are coming from and I am sorry to hear that. We have to have the account number this gives us access as well to see if you are an authorized user on the account. Do you have the primary phone number on the account? I can try to see if that pulls up the account. If you are not an authorized user on the account I would be limited to information that I can provide you. I do apologize for the inconvenience.

  
*I just want the channel lineup. Why in the H%$& (I literally typed H%$&) would I need to be an authorized user to see that?*

*Can you give me the lineup for every channel in 36027? Shouldn't matter whose account it is.*

  
I do understand your frustration, but I would like for us to remain professional throughout this chat. It allows us to pull up the account to see what tv package they have. This then allows me to better assist you with that channel. It is their account and for you to have certain information you would need to be on the account as an authorized user. I can still take a look into this for you if you would allow me just a moment.

*I realize they can only get the ones to which they subscribe.*  
I do understand. One moment please.

  
*OR you can send me the channel numbers for about 15 networks...would you rather do that?*

*I'm happy either way.*

  
I'm checking on this for you now. Just a moment please.

August 19 at 1:43 PM  Thank you for your patience while I looked into this. From the information I was able to gather we would still need their account number or full service address. You would still need to be an authorized user on the account as well. Just due to the fact it will allow me to see the TV package they are subscribed to and to provide this information. Although this is something very simple as a tv channel lineup. I'm actually not able to see it on my end without the account number or full service address. Even after that we would still need you to be authorized for me to speak on the details of their account.

*I entered the address to the chat bot. Does it not follow me to you?*

  
I do apologize for this headache. I do know that this is very frustrating because it is so simple, but this is just the process and the way that it is set up for account access.

  
*4\*\* N R\*\*\*\*\*\*\* St \*\*\*\*\*\*, Al 36\*\*\*.*  


It actually did not come in on my end, but thank you for this information. I will take a look into this for you now.

  
*Account is under D\*\*\*\*\*\* R\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, 4xx-xxx-xxxx*  


Okay, thank you for that information. Please give me one moment.

August 19 at 1:48 PM  Thank you for your patience while I looked into this. I do see that it pulls up the account, but you are not listed as an authorized user on the account unfortunately. The only way we would be able to proceed is having them to add you as an authorized user. Or if they know what TV package they are subscribed to you can go to [https://www.spectrum.net/support/tv/channel-lineup-and-spectrum-tv-packages](https://www.spectrum.net/support/tv/channel-lineup-and-spectrum-tv-packages) and try to find the channel through the lineup this way.

  
*Did you read any of my messages? I told you that*

*I'm not an authorized user on the account. Are you just trying to annoy me?*

[https://www.spectrum.com/cable-tv/channel-lineup](https://www.spectrum.com/cable-tv/channel-lineup) is also another good link for the channel line up that you can try to find that specific channel without needing the log in information as well.

  
*That link does not give the channel numbers...it asks for login to see channel numbers,*

Yes, I have read your messages, but at this time these are the only options that I would have available for you. I would suggest the last link to use you will not need the login information.

*that's the same thing the 800 agent sent me.*  
*All I'm trying to do is help a 93 year old man watch a ballgame and Charter is just giving me the runaround.*

  
Again, I do apologize. This is all that we are able to provide you to at least get you to a resolution for this issue.

I understand and I do apologize.

  
*What's the local number for charter in E\*\*\*\*\*, XX?*  
*phone number*

Let me grab that.

*or do I have to give you login info to get that?*

*I've spent an hour on this........*

The phone number for Charter would be (833) 267-6094.

  
*that's to the local Eufala location? Looks like the number I called an hour ago and got sent the same useless link you sent to me.*

  
That is the phone number for Charter in Eufala or would you like the local spectrum store?

*Will I get an option to get a transcript of this chat? I'm sure you're a very nice person and doing all that you can, but this system is awful.*  
*That's a national toll free number.*  
*Any local number would be great.*

Yes, I do apologize. The local number that I see would be (866) 874-2389

Are you in the United States.  
Yes I am.

  
*Do you know that 8xx numbers are toll free nationwide, not local numbers?*

*Will I get an option to get a copy of this chat? Again, you're great...it's the system that is awful.*

  
Yes, I am aware. The phone number that I have provided is the only one that it provides for that location.

*I could have googled that...*

I do apologize for the frustration I know it has been a lot of back and forth over a simple tv channel. It's just the process that we have to take. I've tried on my end to even search the channel in google for you, but it just shows multiple different options.  
At this time you would do not provide the option to get a copy of the chat. The chat will remain visible as long as you do not close it out.  
END  
At this point, I copied and pasted the above (editing personal info).  I also deleted the duplicate (redundant) responses from the agent - everything she typed posted twice.",0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/wslams/charter_spectrum_fail/,2022-08-19 18:32:16,Booking.com
CustomerService,Worst experience in customer service - any advice?,"This has been the absolute worst customer experience adventure in the history of customer service experiences. I booked a multnomah falls tour in Portland, oregon and ended having to cancel the tour. I cancelled the tour within the allotted timeframe to be able to receive my refund. I even got a confirmation email stating I would receive my refund - so I waited. And waited. Aannnd waited. Almost 3 weeks later I started making inquiries. I started by calling World Tours Hub as this website (https://americashubworldtours.com/) is where I booked my tour - they said I needed to contact a company called Viator to receive my refund because they didn’t get any money - so no money to refund. I called Viator who at first said they couldn’t refund me because they didn’t have my credit card information on file and I needed to contact the booking place for the refund. So I did…again. When I called World Tour Hub again they told me the same thing they said before - call Viator because they were wrong and they are the ones who have to refund me. /sigh. So I called Viator back and they are now saying they DID refund me my full amount - but I have to contact Groupon because that’s who they sent the money to. WHAT?? When I asked them why they sent money there they claimed it was because that’s who I booked through. I didn’t. I booked through  https://americashubworldtours.com/ and I had absolutely nothing to do with Groupon - Viator claims differently. When I asked to speak to a manager I was hung up on - not once but TWICE. When I asked Viator for some confirmation they sent Groupon the full refund they could not provide me with anything but they did tell me they would contact Groupon on my behalf (oh boy! I feel like I’m getting somewhere now! -_-). I have contacted the bank to see what they can see and if they can help me - but this is still an on going battle.

CustomerService,TAP Air: Is Air Portugal Scamming People? [MY STORY},"I've been planning + saving for big, once-in-a-lifetime trip to Spain with my fiance this Summer.

We're going for two weeks, and it's a gift to him, so it's an expensive trip. I've been paying it off ahead to make it not that impactful - this week was time to buy plane tickets

I purchased two roundtrip flights from TAP Air / Portugal Airlines - a pretty good deal of $650/each roundtrip. But I'm an idiot, and had a typo (one letter) wrong in his last name. 

With any major airliner, this isn't a big deal. I can call customer support and get it fixed, or cancel my flight and rebook that same day.

Well since then, I've realized that Air Portugal is ???? failing as we speak? a scam? IDK??

**Here are the various channels I've attempted AND FAILED to connect with their team:**

* Its [**website**](http://www.flytap.com/), you are prompted to enter your flight to get into its [booking portal](https://booking.flytap.com/lite/). That portal giving a ""403 Forbidden Microsoft-Azure-Application-Gateway/v2"" and at this time, its main website is too. The main website was live just a few hours ago
* Its **mobile app** allows you to sign-in / enter your flight info, and you can see your reservation. When you click on ""update/change flight"" or ""view my personal info"" buttons, you're given a ""no internet connection"" page. 
* Its **phone support**. The first time I called, I was on hold for 20 minutes and hit a rep. She was nice, and said she would put me on hold while she approved the name change. Disconnected after waiting on hold for 5 minutes. Call back, this time I'm on hold for an hour, and then disconnected. I've tried this 3 additional times, all to the same effect. No answer ever, hour on hold, disconnected.
* No **live chat**.
* No response from **Facebook or Twitter**, including DMs and public postings.
* No response from an **email** to their support.
* I EVEN STARTED IN-MAILING CUSTOMER SUPPORT/MARKETING EMPLOYEES OF THE AIRLINE ON LINKEDIN  


I don't know what to do Reddit. 

Should I:

* Call my bank to see if they'll remove the charge from my credit card
* Wait until the flight date and hope they make the change at the airport 
* ????

Recently tried to rebook, but they couldn't accommodate my schedule - they offered to bump me around different rooms for my stay, but they couldn't fit me in anywhere for the duration.  Not thrilled, but OK, but then I try and book flights, and airlines in South Africa into Cape Town are are a mess right now.  So I contacted them - I can't get there, you can't give me a room anyway, so let's just call the whole thing off.  Sure, they say, but no refund.

CustomerService,Wyndham & Resorts - Members always get the lowest prices just maybe not a room,"For context: my girlfriend, her dog (a 92 pound Amstaff named Tyler), and I are driving back from Texas to Florida following Thanksgiving. The first leg of the trip put us in Mobile, Alabama -  a good 7+ hour drive from where we were staying. My girlfriend made the reservation at the La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Mobile - Tillman’s Corner as La Quinta hotels are pet friendly.

My girlfriend made the reservation on the official Wyndham page, receiving a confirmation number via email. I should also mention she’s a gold status member with Wyndham whatever that means (apparently not much).

Since we were estimated to arrive at 10:30 pm, we called ahead to let them know we were going to get in late. The front desk clerk answered and proceeded to assure us: “No worries - I’ll be here all night.” She then hung up, without even asking for either our name or confirmation number, which I can only assume must be this establishment’s proper procedure. 

We arrive, not even 3 hours from when the call was made. My girlfriend walks in and watches as the lady at the front desk hands a customer his room key. When my girlfriend speaks with the lady, she immediately recognizes the lady to be the same person she spoke with on the phone. 

My girlfriend began to tell the lady she had a reservation. The lady informed her they were overbooked. My girlfriend rebutted saying how she was the one that called earlier to let them know we were getting in late and how specifically she had said it would be fine. The lady replied that she understood but “they” overbooked them. When my girlfriend asked who “they” were, the lady responded naming one of the big online booking platforms (hotels.com/Travelocity). My girlfriend objected saying how she is a Wyndham member and made the reservation directly on the Wyndham website. The lady then tells my girlfriend how “she tried to call and had left voicemails.”

Now, two important points to mention here 1) my girlfriend’s phone shows no record of any call or voicemail being received 2) the lady at no point asked for my girlfriend’s name or confirmation number - how would she even know who my girlfriend is?

Getting back to the interaction - my girlfriend then pressed her on how the man that had just come in had been able to get a key. The lady answered admitting that the man had just walked in. When my girlfriend objected saying how she had a reservation, the lady informed her once again how ”they” overbooked them.  

At this point my girlfriend is so fed up with the exchange she leaves. She walks back to the car and informs me of what had just transpired as I look on incredulously. I confirm with her that she did in fact receive a confirmation number, to which she showed me the email confirmation evidencing the reservation. I couldn’t comprehend what was going on - how could a hotel confirm a reservation on its own corporate website, we then call to confirm the reservation, but are then turned away? At this hour? With a dog? 

I felt like Jerry Seinfeld when he showed up at the car rental place “anybody can take reservations, the important thing is holding the reservation”. I went in to investigate and try to understand what could possibly be going on here.

I walk into the hotel and see no one at the front desk. I ring the bell and a lady sitting just out of view behind the far left corner of the desk responds with a low “yes?”. I informed her who I was and inquired as to how we could have a confirmation number but be turned away. She repeated to me the same story she told my girlfriend - how they had the reservation but are overbooked (queue Seinfeld music). When she could see I wasn’t satisfied with her response she implored me not to be mad at her and how it wasn’t her fault and how she had nothing to do with it.

Now I was already upset, but this comment made me livid. I have sympathy for employees in customer service jobs - I really do. They often times get blown up on and they had nothing to do with the person’s problem at hand. But this ladies and gentleman is nothing like that. This EXACT SAME lady not three hours ago assured us everything was fine. “No worries”. 

No I demanded for her to explain how this wasn’t her fault when my girlfriend had called and confirmed with HER specifically that the reservation was fine. 

She apparently was not a fan of my line of questioning and told me to leave or she would call cops on me. I was not a fan of her ultimatum when I, as a customer with a confirmed reservation, felt like I was owed a service and had a right to be where I was, demanded some kind of response from her, some kind of helpful gesture such as assisting us in transferring our reservation to a sister hotel close by, or some kind of admittance of guilt, or honestly even the slightest acknowledgment of this awful situation she helped thrust upon us. 

When I did not abide by her request to leave, the lady picked up the phone and called the police on me. I talked with another customer who was sympathetic to my situation while she was on the phone. The lady then hung up the phone and informed me the cops were on their way. I responded telling her “good I’m not going to be here anyways, I’ve apparently got to drive to the next La Quinta” and walked out. As I was walking out she exclaimed how it didn’t matter that I was leaving because she had my information - again which she did not because she never asked me nor my girlfriend for it.

I got back in the car and drove out of the front loading area and into the Holiday Inn parking lot across the street where we called the National customer service line. After informing them of the situation the customer service rep gave us a new reservation confirmation. As we’re talking to the customer service rep we saw two police cars pull up to the La Quinta - pretty quick response time I thought considering I had overheard the lady mention to the cops I was white (kidding). Come to think of it that question (my race) had came up pretty quickly during the police call too - basically the first thing they seemed to ask her as I heard her respond “he’s white”. 

We thought everything was well and good and the worst was behind us until we got the emailed confirmation. My girlfriend grabbed the address from the new confirmation and put it into the GPS - it was for the exact same hotel. Overbooked? Not for the National customer service line I guess. 

Obviously, we couldn’t go back to the same hotel so we called the National customer service line again and got a very helpful rep who made us a new reservation in a La Quinta 30 mins away and we were finally able to get some rest (Tyler included) before the next leg of the journey.

The most disconcerting part of the whole situation is that as my girlfriend and I were reflecting back on everything that happened we couldn’t help but wonder if her race was somehow at play. My girlfriend is Mexican and, as she would say and I would confirm, she looks pretty Mexican. 

Now I’d like to say I’m not entirely convinced this lady was racist and that my girlfriend being Mexican is the reason we didn’t get a room; however you really have to wonder about some of these facts - how dismissive and rude the lady was in the exchange, how she never asked for my girlfriends information before informing her they were overbooked, how the white male in front of her was able to get a room (a walk-in as the lady admitted), how quickly it escalated to calling the cops, how the national customer service rep was able to make a new reservation at the exact same hotel that was supposedly overbooked. It just doesn’t sit well when you really ponder on what happened.

Regardless of whether my girlfriends race was at play, I think any reasonable person would agree that this lady handled the situation about as bad as a person could. I have since filed formal complaints with both the national and local customer service hotlines and await to hear their resolution which I was informed would take around a week.

TL;DR - Girlfriend makes hotel booking on main Wyndham website to which she is a member. Calls to confirm reservation 3 hours prior to arrival and is told reservation is fine. We arrive at hotel in Mobile Alabama and my Mexican GF goes in and is told the hotel is overbooked after watching a white male walk-in and receive a hotel key. Argues to no avail. I go inside to protest and get the cops calls on me. Leave before they show up but watch from parking lot as two cop cars pull up. Call national customer service line and they make us a new booking at the SAME hotel (but it was overbooked?). Called back and got a new reservation at a different hotel thirty mins away. Seems like we dealt with either racism or the worlds worst employee.",7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/r4cuhv/wyndham_resorts_members_always_get_the_lowest/,2021-11-28 19:58:03,Booking.com
CustomerService,"Qantas/nib refused my travel insurance claim because my mother, who lives in the UK and died last month, doesn't count as a close relative","I was planning a trip to NT in July but found out in June that my mother was admitted to hospital in the UK. I cancelled this trip to NT and instead returned to the UK to be with my mother, who died last month. I took out Qantas travel insurance when booking my flights to NT and I spent hours on the phone to their customer service team with queries on how to proceed with a claim. At no point did anyone say that my mother living in the UK would be an issue.

A few months later, and a couple of weeks after she died, I was told my claim had been refused because she doesn't count as a close relative. This was escalated and reviewed, and the initial decision was upheld.

Their definition of a close relative is:

>a relative of yours or of a member of your travelling party, who is resident in Australia or New Zealand. It means a spouse, de facto partner, parent, parent-in-law, daughter, son, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, brother, sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, niece, nephew, grandchildren, grandparent, step-parent, step-children, fiancé or fiancée, or legal guardian.

Their interpretation is that the relative should be an Australian or New Zealand resident, though when I read it I took it to mean that the travelling party should be an Australian or New Zealand resident.

I will be appealing this decision with Australian Financial Complaints Authority as per their recommendation, but it's really not what I want to be doing right now when I need to be sorting out my mother's affairs and I still haven't been able to bury her yet. I had hoped [my angry tweet](https://twitter.com/spinstartshere/status/1450966075798167559?s=20) would be enough to sway them but I'm a very insignificant nobody on Twitter and it's not really garnered any traction.

To add insult to injury, I can't access the flight credit that Qantas issued me to book flights home to Sydney so, for the moment, I'm $1000 down.

I'm posting this here in the hope that other people won't get caught out here, especially with the upcoming plans to allow international travel again - though can anyone ever really predict sudden and serious illness?",7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/qdgs79/qantasnib_refused_my_travel_insurance_claim/,2021-10-22 13:19:26,Booking.com
CustomerService,Kiwi.com Ripped Me Off. I Blame Kayak.com Too.,"I used to use [Kayak.com](https://Kayak.com) regularly. I strongly discourage that now; use Kayak as a search engine, but book any flights directly. It's true that Kayak is less likely to burn you on a domestic (USA) flight, but I would not give them my business if they are not willing to stand with their users against their customers.

Anyway, I found a booking on Kiwi and bought it in January of 2020, for a flight in May, 2020. We all know what happened next, right? Long story short, it is now ALMOST SIX MONTHS, and I still have not received the refund mandated by European law.

If you duck-duck-go Kiwi, you can find that I am hardly an exception. There may easily be thousands of very unhappy customers of Kiwi. I called a lawyer who was happy to take my money (consultation fee) to explain to me that she has no legal authority in Europe. Which, of course, is what lawyers do: They take your money to tell you what you know already.

Here is another such person from this very forum: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/e28me8/kiwicom\_ripped\_me\_off/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/e28me8/kiwicom_ripped_me_off/)

I want everyone to know that [Kiwi.com](https://Kiwi.com) is a rip off, and so is Kayak, as far as I'm concerned. That whole ""I'm just a broker"" thing that Kayak is always saying is great, really really great, except I'm out almost $2,000 for a flight that I never took, and it was Kayak who introduced me to the guy who did that to me.

If there is anything I can actually do about this, please let me know in the comments. They rip people off so much at Kiwi, that you can't actually email or call anyone. All the emails I received are from non-reply addresses. The phone number is an 800 number IVR system running on a blade server somewhere about five hundred miles from a human being. It all seems very much by design.",4,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/jewquo/kiwicom_ripped_me_off_i_blame_kayakcom_too/,2020-10-20 19:29:30,Booking.com
CustomerService,STAY AWAY from Frontier Airlines,"I have had the worst experience with Frontier Airlines over the last couple of weeks.

TLDR: They delayed the flight for 6 hours until there were no more flights that day, gave us letters for reimbursements for another flight or rental car (which would take weeks to receive and not cover everything), and their letter explaining your options is cryptic.  


We had a flight out of Dulles on June 13, 2018.  The flight was delayed in short intervals for 6 hours until it was finally cancelled at 9:30pm.  They didn't offer to find new bookings for anyone to get to their destinations, nor did they offer to find accommodations for those who had nowhere to stay.  (I thought this was normal procedure for an airline who cancel's a flight?)

[We were given a letter](https://i.imgur.com/ggxEFxp.jpg) which states that we could either get a refund for the flight +500 in Travel Vouchers...OR...Have a max reimbursement for a rental car or another flight of up to $400 per person +200 in Travel Vouchers.

Their requirements for re-bookings [(see letter)](https://i.imgur.com/ggxEFxp.jpgg) and our requirements to get home for work ended up getting us on a United flight the next day.  This flight exceeded the $400 max reimbursement they offered.  There were no flights available under that price point.

They also provided a letter for hotel reimbursement up to $150, but all we could find was a $20 Lyft/Uber drive away from the airport.  

All in all, I was out $1,443.56 by the next morning.  The only thing provided at the gate was paperwork telling you how to be reimbursed later.  


I got home and made call to their customer service.  They said that they can't do anything at this level and to send an email to get the ball rolling.  The email goes unanswered for a week.  I call again, go through 2 levels of people and their supervisor.  This takes an hour.  The next guy tells me he'll call me back when he has the next level person on the phone.  He does, but as soon as I get transferred I get hung up on.  This happened twice in one night.  
This was a total of 3.5 hours of time to get nowhere.  I looked up their ""Director of Customer Care"" and sent her an email directly. 
 It has gone unanswered for 36 hours so far.  Today I call again.  After 1.5 hours I finally get to the higher person...get hung up on.  Thankfully they call me back.  

My request was for Frontier to reimburse me for my flight, hotel, and taxi costs, as well as a refund for the flight I didn't take with them.  (Lofty ask...but I felt it was the right thing)  The Frontier flight was worth $256.60, the United Airlines flight was $193.60 above the offered $800, the hotel was $4.56 above the $150 offered (which I was willing to let go), and the Lyft fees were $38.80.  That is a total of **$1,443.56**.  I understand this is beyond what the letter said, but I was just so frustrated with the fact that I'm out of pocket all of this because of their mistake.  If I maxed out [option 2 on the letter](https://i.imgur.com/ggxEFxp.jpg), I would get $800 and with the hotel letter (not included on this post) I'd get $150.  If I got every penny of that, I'm still out of pocket $493.56.  

Today I was told on the phone that their reimbursements are set at the corporate level and that it won't change.  That's all they'll give me.  There is nothing she can do.  She also said there was no one else I could talk to.  In fact *(and this is the kicker)* I'll be receiving a refund within that $400 per person, not in addition to.  She made it sound like that was going to happen no matter what.  I don't read that in [the letter](https://i.imgur.com/ggxEFxp.jpg) at all, do you?  I suppose you could argue semantics for where this bit of money is coming from...but regardless they're only going to put out $950.  This means:  

* $150 in reimbursements for 1 night at hotel
* $800 in reimbursements for the United Flight ($400 per person x2 people) (which includes a refund of the $256.60 for the flight not taken)
* **$693.40 of ACTUAL Refunded money back for my trouble**

Not even close to what it should be.  ***This means I'm still $750.16 out of pocket because they canceled a flight.*** Am I crazy?  Is this real life?  I'm fuming and wish there was something I could do.

CustomerService,Resilio Inc and my attempts to get a response,"Well I've hit the 30 day mark of trying to get a response with no luck. Guess I need to make this go wider.

I use resilio sync to manage transferring audio and digital books from my PC to my phone. It is SUPPOSED to use WiFi only. All settings that can be set are set and have been set.

I started syncing a fee audio books on a wifi network that blocks the Torrent protocol (unbeknownst to me) but only that. All other communication protocols the app uses work fine. The result? The app downloaded 3gb worth of media over mobile because torrent wasn't blocked there. (I didn't know this was the root cause at the time)

The second time this happened I had accidentally told sync to ""sync all"" on a main folder. On the same wifi network. Same result.

Every gb cost me $10. Finally result was their app cost me $80.

I submitted error report for first incident in Nov. I submitted second error report in Dec. I replied via the confirmation emails. After discovering the root cause, I managed to get logged in to their support site. The tickets had been marked resolved.

I added details about how to reproduce the issue which reopened the tickets. I then began tweeting at their account. Every day. Seeing if I'd get a response. It appears not.

I now can't access their help desk to view the tickets. I tried to join their forums. Nothing.

I've tried every single reasonable method to get ahold of them.

How hard is it to respond?

CustomerService,"Deceived by Trivago, and attempts for assistance have been ignored.","Thursday night, i was trying to find a hotel for a trip to Sydney and Trivago had [this deal](https://imgur.com/aIzmDOy) on their website. Down from $20,601 to $910 for 3 nights, 96% off, hard to refuse, right? After checking the [hotel's website](https://www.ovolohotels.com.au/ovolowoolloomooloo/) the $6000 per night rate is in line with the top suites on offer, and the pictures, room features, and name of the room itself (Superior King) led me to believe that I was indeed hiring the top suite.

I rang the hotel the following morning to ensure this was the case, but unfortunately was told that I had merely booked a standard room, which was not in line with what Trivago had promoted. There is no King Superior room at this hotel, so I have been sold something that doesn't exist and they have insanely jacked up the price for a standard room to make it appear to be the absolute steal that I thought it was.

Friday afternoon I sent an email to Trivago's customer service section on their website, and this morning sent a message to their facebook page, but both have so far (As of Saturday night here) been ignored.

Just wanted to leave this story as a warning against using Trivago, and also might there be any other way I can get in touch with them or seek any follow up at all?

CustomerService,Greyhound has faulty info on their website (among other terrible customer service),"I took a trip 2 months ago, via Greyhound, from Denver Colorado to Springville, NY (and back).  On the way there, they lost my luggage and the bus broke down a few hours from my destination and I ended up taking an unrelated bus service to my final location.  All of this was fairly stressful but nothing compared to my return trip.

On my return trip, I went to the address listed on Greyhound's website:
https://www.greyhound.com/en/locations/terminal.aspx?city=153472
This is NOT where the bus stops.  The bus only goes down the highway off-ramp and stops at the stop-sign on the opposite side of the of the highway.  Since they didn't see me standing there, they went about their route, leaving me behind.  No other bus service was available for 24 hours so I had to find (and walk to) a hotel, food, etc.  The second day when I was finally picked up, it was then a hassle to explain what had happened to EVERY bus station along the route until finally a kindhearted terminal manager re-issued my tickets.  Unfortunately this added to the already over-booked bus and I got bumped to an ""alternate bus"" which happened to be one of their old models with barely a working air-conditioner (definitely no WiFi or electrical outlets).

Once I finally got home, I spent numerous hours on the phone with various customer service representatives.  I was told they were mailing me a form which I could fill out for compensation for my delay.  Three weeks went by and I received nothing so I called them on 8/13 and spent about 2 hours re-explaining my situation before I was told that the MOST they could offer for my ""delay refund"" was $70, a value they arrived at by some formula involving ""the number of total hours delayed and the cost of the ticket"".  This amount doesn't even cover my hotel fee, let alone food, the day of work lost and all of the trouble I went through.  It also took 3 additional weeks for the refund to show up on my account.

The baggage-claim was a separate issue I would need to return to the station to file a claim for.  I filed my ""official"" claim on 8/12 (even though they had been made aware of my lost luggage way back on 7/17).  Today (9/14) I was told to wait another 60 days and ""someone will contact you about the value of your lost items and forms of compensation"".  This means it will be 4 months after returning from my trip before I am even contacted about compensation for my lost luggage.

I was also told multiple times during the process that I ought to call the stations I stopped at, to ask them about my luggage (uhh..... Isn't that YOUR job?).  Interestingly, when I call the Greyhound terminals, NO ONE ANSWERS!  I have had this experience with Denver and Pittsburgh.  No matter which number on their site I call (and even the numbers provided by the corporate customer service), it just rings and rings.  Sometimes I get to a voice-mail but this is usually full and any messages I've left have never been responded to.  While I was in the station, I actually WATCHED the phone behind the desk just ring and ring while every agent around ignored it.
This entire experience has been infuriating.  It's too bad Greyhound has such a monopoly on the coast-to-coast bus service, because they really do not deserve to be the go-to.

TLDR: Bad website info caused a 24-hour delay and they lost my luggage and 2 months later, the only compensation I've seen is $70, which doesn't even cover the hotel.",5,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/3kyz8r/greyhound_has_faulty_info_on_their_website_among/,2015-09-14 22:55:11,Booking.com
CustomerService,Now I see why nobody uses AOL,"Recently, I was having trouble with my Apple ID and the one way to fix this problem was to answer some questions or take the Email route. So, I decided to take the Email route. I open aol.com to then go to the Email section. I place in my username and password to get an error. So, I try again with a different password. Error after error, I try about 3 times til I decide to go reset my password. I enter my Username then I was asked to call the number.

I call the number on the screen to go to customer service. they ask my name I give it to them they then read it back wrong so I correct them. I read off my name again in a louder sharper tone, and it's read the same way as before. Then, I go no and then follow each letter with a word that starts with that letter and gets it wrong again. So, finally I say it but this time louder and sharper and she finally gets my name right.

Now, I actually get to try to unlock my account as she says it's been blocked. She asks my security question of ""What's your favorite book"". Now, this wouldn't be a problem yet, I made this email at 7 years old so I had no idea what my favorite book could have been. She gives me three attempts that I obviously fail. She then refers me to two options. 1) talk to someone who had access to the account(I am the only person with access to the account) 2) Go to AOL support. So then I decide maybe apple will help.There I'll change my email address and be done with apple.

I then try to log in my apple account with the security questions. I fail to input them correctly. So, I call customer support and it's an automated system that asked what I wanted help for and told me a website for that system. I went to the system that then asked for my security questions.

I think in heins sight I should have been more careful and gave my account more options. But that's not the point the point is that these security questions need to stop nobody remembers them. Although, I will take the blame for not giving myself more options it ju8st seems like a hard thing to justify these security questions. Most people who answer these questions just take a shot in the dark.

CustomerService,Turned away for the Windows XP trade-in promotion. Just fired off this rant to a poor Best Buy employee.... Sorry dude.,"Earlier this week I heard that Best Buy was offering $100 dollars toward a new laptop simply by bringing in an older computer with Windows XP. Having an old laptop that sees very little use these days, I was really excited. I saw that the Acer C720 Chromebook was one of the ones being pushed, and this was actually the exact laptop I wanted. We use them at work, so I'm already familiar with them and I like them quite a bit.

Yesterday afternoon I stopped in, excited to come home with a new toy. But my visit was less than exciting, and I went home with my old brick.

I was told by the guy at the customer service desk at the Traverse City, MI location, James was his name I believe, that it was not on the trade-in list. He even showed me what was on the screen for Dell Latitudes -- but the funny thing was, the few Latitudes listed were all fairly recent models that definitely didn't come pre-installed with Windows XP -- so how could they possibly qualify for this offer?

I did as much research on the offer as I could before coming in. I told James that I read if it didn't qualify for ""trade-in"" it would qualify for ""recycling for trade in."" All he said was ""It's not on the list."" This sounded ridiculous to me. You only take specific models for recycling? What are people supposed to do then? Just throw out items that Best Buy doesn't deem acceptable? Real good for the environment there.

James was not particularly helpful or very pleasant to deal with, just seemed like he wanted to get rid of me. And I get that, to an extent. Dealing with angry people is difficult. I asked him if he could give me a number or email for a corporate contact, because I was not pleased and, frankly, was pretty sure he was wrong. He couldn't give me either, but instead told me I could call 1-888-BESTBUY.

(In my job I deal with a lot of really difficult people. He didn't handle this as well as he could have.)

So I did. I sat in my car in the parking lot and made a call. The first representative I talked to was fairly understanding, and seemed like she wanted to help. She tried to transfer me at one point, to someone she thought could more easily help me. When I got a message that said it would be 13 minutes, and offered the choice to stay on the line or enter my number for a call-back, I selected the latter. I entered my phone number at least five times and it told me each time that the number was invalid. Obviously by now I'm thinking This is ridiculous. I had no choice but to end the call and call back.

On my second call, the representative basically just read me the offer as she read it off from her computer, and didn't offer any new details. I told her that I talked to someone at the Customer Service desk, and she told me that it is Geek Squad that is handling these exchanges, not Customer Service. So I was like, ""Great!"" and headed back into the store. I stood in line to talk to the Geek Squad guy, and while I waited, James, who I'd talked to before, asked me if he could help me. I told him what I was told on the phone, and he told me that was incorrect. He said Geek Squad has nothing to do with the exchanges, and that he handles all of them.

By now I was fairly livid. Of the three people I'd talked to, each one said something different to me, and none of them seemed correct.

So I left the store and made another phone call, after taking about 10 minutes to cool down. Each woman I spoke to on the phone was helpful to a degree, but every one of them told me something completely different. It wasn't until the third call that the representative told me it's handled in store and that her line, which was an online help line, couldn't really do anything to help me. She apparently tried to get in contact with someone in the local store. She was really trying to help. So as far as I'm aware there is now a profile for me that has my phone number and email listed. It probably has some details surrounding my complaint, and might even have a note that said I was pissed off and acting unreasonably. These are not unfair judgments based on our interaction -- but I am far from unreasonable. I'm an informed consumer and it seemed very clear to me that I was being jerked around by employees that don't even know the details to their store's own offer.

So I spent a good chunk of yesterday evening furious. It seems clear to me that Best Buy, as a company, was taking the end of the support cycle for Windows XP as an opportunity not only to make some money, but to foster some good will among consumers. Hey, we want you to upgrade your technology!

But apparently only so badly.

Looking around online (I'll expand upon this more in a minute), it's pretty clear that I'm not the only one to have had a negative experience with this particular trade-in offer. Best Buy has really dropped the ball, it seems. Every location is handling the exchange differently, all have different standards, none of the employees seem to know what the hell is going on.... And frankly, it left a really bad taste in my mouth. I came in practically going ""Hey, ho, I'd like to spend some money now,"" and I'm basically told, ""Yeah, we want crappy old laptops, but not your crappy old laptop!""

But when I got home, I looked it up. And as far as I can tell, everyone I talked to was wrong. Even though they all gave me different information, all of it seemed to be wrong.

So let's go through this chunk by chunk. First, [the Best Buy page for the offer](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Computing-Promotions/Windows-XP-Trade-In-Offer/pcmcat327400050019.c?id=pcmcat327400050019).

On this page there are two statements that even hint at certain computers not qualifying. In the fine print at the bottom it says "" Not all products are eligible for trade-in. Not available in all locations and some stores may have additional limitations."" That and the very mention of ""trade-in"" are the only things. There isn't really a way to know whether your laptop qualifies without driving to the store -- which for me is 20 minutes away -- and having them turn you away.

So, no, a Dell Latitude C640 -- even though it came with Windows XP, even though it powers on and works and is in farily decent shape, and even though it's an old piece of crap that needs to be upgraded -- doesn't qualify for ""trade-in."" No, you're not going to make any money reselling it. But if you just want to make money reselling people's used wares, you're not going to find many XP computers that qualify at all.

This is where the ""recycle for trade in"" comes into play.

Check this out: [A compilation of info collected after a bunch of people complained about their experience with this particular offer.](http://slickdeals.net/f/6836652-best-buy-offering-minimum-100-trade-in-for-xp-laptops-starting-sunday-april-6-2014?p=67237206#edit67237206) And even some attachments of a Job Aid sheet that explains to Best Buy employees how they are supposed to handle the swap.

Here's some of the pertinent info from there.

>OK I stand corrected-you guys were right I was wrong!
i went back in after being turned away AT 10AM when the girl looked my old laptop up on a list.i found a manager at first he said no good, but I complained and said to call Corporate if you have to.I said the list he has is only of newer laptops with newer operating systems on them .

>I got my $25 & $75 and used my tax ID & walked away with a Acer chrome book for $99.00 out the door.


""Recycle for trade in."" Key words.

And some of the stuff on the Job Aid is even more damning of my experience.

CustomerService,Hotels.com won't honor their Price Match guarantee,"On July 16th I booked an airline ticket through Hotels.com. The ticket was not part of a ""Package deal"". It was a standalone ticket for 2 pax from DFW to MAD. It cost $1,047.06 each (for a total of $2,094.12). Here's a [screenshot of hotels.com](http://imgur.com/3zmwFJ6).

Hotels.com prominently displays a link to their ""Price match guarantee"". They claim that they will match the price of an airline ticket if a cheaper one is to be found online.

I found a cheaper airline ticket for the same day, same airline, same flight number. Everything is identical. Except it was $903.00 per pax (for a total of $1,806.00) - a difference of $288.12. Here's a [screenshot of justfly.com's site](http://imgur.com/CbF0gyy).

I captured screenshots and submitted a price match request through hotels.com's website. Soon I got an email saying that they won't be able to match the price because what I have is a ""package deal"". Note that I did not get a hotel room. All I booked is airline tickets. I called their customer service number. After being transferred around for multiple times, and being told that they couldn't help me, I asked to speak to a supervisor.

Once a supervisor came online, she was able to try and help me. She needed to see the site where the lower price was advertised. I walked her through how to get to the site. It's a US based site where anyone can get the same tickets for less. However, mysteriously she was ""unable"" to find the lower price. I sent her screenshots that I took while speaking with her on the phone that clearly show the lower price.

Finally (**after being on the phone for 90 minutes**) she relented and agreed that the price was indeed lower on justfly.com and agreed to refund me the difference. That was last week on Monday (07/18). She said it would take between 2-5 business days. It's been more than that now. So, I sent a follow up email on Monday the 25th of July. Haven't heard back from them. I have checked my credit card and don't see any refund either.

It's frustrating that companies advertise that they will price match, and add a bunch of fine print, but when someone is able to find a lower price that meets every fine print and nuance they can throw at me, they suddenly decide to just not honor their word.",6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/4uub7v/hotelscom_wont_honor_their_price_match_guarantee/,2016-07-27 12:19:12,Booking.com

CustomerService,"Elan Vacations - Rented OBX Home For Mini Family Reunion, Worst Rental Home Ever","I rented a home called Whalehead Summit located in Corolla, NC from Elan Vacations - http://www.elanvacations.com/. It was supposed to be a mini family reunion type of thing. Everyone who came drove ten or more hours to get there. 

Upon arrival at this home, the house was a mess. It was barely cleaned, dirt all over the floors, counters not cleaned properly, and one member of my family even found candy wrappers in a bed! When going outside, we noticed the pool wasn’t cleaned and in fact had sand all over it. We started cleaning the house ourselves since we didn’t want to stay in such filth, I called them and left a message, but the phone call was never returned.

We shortly after that realized the hot tub was not functioning, I called and actually got someone on the phone who sent someone out to repair the hot tub. They had no comment about the call I made earlier about how dirty the home was when we arrived, but they did send someone out to clean the pool.

On the third day of the trip, family sleeping on the bottom floor of the house woke up to a leak coming from the ceiling. We noticed at this time the second floor of the home was also extremely warm. I called Elan Vacations and they sent someone out who looked at it, and said he couldn’t fix it and we would need to wait for an air conditioning company. We waited for someone to come out, who worked on the unit for most of the day. He said there was no way to fix the leak coming from the ceiling, and that we would just have to deal with the leak or leave the A/C off. He recharged the system and left, but not before he cut a hole in the wall looking for the leak.

I couldn’t have family sleeping in a room that had leaking water, so unfortunately everyone had to move to the top floor of the home. We had to stay on this top floor for three days, never hearing from Elan Vacations about what was happening or what we should be doing. I followed up and never received a call back from a manager even though I asked. We would have left, but the drive was 10+ hours for everyone, and we were trying to make the best of things.

So basically I paid a good amount of money to rent the top floor of a house, the vacation was essentially ruined, and now Elan Vacations will do nothing other than offer me 10% off a future home rental.

The Whalehead Summit home had broken deck chairs that people fell through, multiple bee’s nest on the deck which resulted in two people being stung, was extremely dirty, had broken appliances such as the upstairs microwave, couldn't use the volleyball court, and overall was not a home I would be happy spending any money on. It was overall a terrible experience. 

I spoke to the manager when we returned the keys to the home and told her all of the issues I had with the home. She assured me that they would make things right. Since then I have had to email her multiple times to try and sort things out, they haven’t done anything other than offer me 10% off a future reservation. 

**tl;dr**- Saved A lot of money to pay for family reunion, house was not what was advertised, house was a mess, a/c broke, trip ruined, Elan Vacations will refund nothing, only want to give me 10% off a future booking, **LIKE I WOULD EVER BOOK WITH ELAN VACATIONS AGAIN**.",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/4w4dhz/elan_vacations_rented_obx_home_for_mini_family/,2016-08-04 12:58:27,Booking.com
CustomerService,Uhaul/All Canadian Self Storage,"To whom it may concern,

On the morning of June 29th, I arrived at All Canadian Self-Storage at 1 Laird Drive, in the Leaside neighbourhood of Toronto. I was there to pick up a truck and 3 dollies (1 utility, 2 furniture) which I had reserved using the Uhaul.com website. With my reservation/confirmation receipt in hand, I approached the desk and was told that the dollies I had reserved were not available, as they were rented on a first come, first serve basis. I immediately was struck by a sense of déjà vu.

On December 4th, 1991 the hit show Seinfeld aired an episode called 'the Alternate Side' that poked fun at the shortfalls of the vehicle rental industry, specifically the practice of not honouring reservations.

In the 24 years since that episode aired, much about our world has changed. Here is a, by no means complete, list of all the things that we, as a world, have seen occur since that episode aired:

- The Soviet Union collapsed, thus bringing the Cold War to an end
- Nelson Mandela was elected president of South Africa, dealing a blow to the awful legacy of apartheid
-The European Union was formed, bringing lasting peace to a continent consumed by bloodshed for centuries
- The Worldwideweb was introduced to the general public, revolutionizing global communication
- Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland made peace, ending decades of conflict
- Cal Ripken Jr. broke Lou Gehrig's 'iron man' record for consecutive games played
- His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, held a mass in communist Cuba
- America elected its first black president
- Professional wrestler The Undertaker won 21 consecutive matches at Wrestlemania.
- Gay marriage was legalized in most of the developed world

If you had asked someone, in December of 1991, whether they thought the above things were possible, many would have openly laughed in your face. However, if you told them that all of these things would occur BEFORE U-Haul figured out a way to take meaningful, actual reservations, rather than laugh, they would likely spit.

Now, I realize that All Canadian Self-Storage is NOT U-Haul, but instead an authorized dealer. Yet I did not make my reservation with them. I did not got to allcanadianselfstorage.ca to book my ""reservation""* -I went to Uhaul.com. While they are independent of your corporation, they advertise using your logo and name, and use your websystem for ""reservations"".

Because of this experience, I will suspend my use of your business (and all of it's authorized dealers) until one of two things happen:

1. You implement a system of communication between your franchisees so that when a reservation is made using your system, it is honoured.•

2. You remove from your website the ability to make reservations that you as a company are unable (or unwilling) to guarantee. Simply replace that portion of the reservation form with a note saying ""We are unable to make reservations for this equipment"".

If you deign to pursue one of these paths, please- by all means - contact me. I will resume considering you a viable option for my rental needs. Likewise, I will be overjoyed to celebrate with you your mastery of the definition of reservation^ and/or the entry of your business into the 21st century.••

Sincerely,
Jason Hawkins

*I feel quotations are necessary, as it is evident our views differ on the word's definition.

• I realize this could be a hardship on your employees, as both your authorized dealer and your customer service agent both seemed to rely on the nebulous disconnect as a method of shirking blame/responsibility for today's incident.

^ I realize the English language can be tricky. Did you ever have a teacher do that 'ghoti' hook thing? Blew my mind.

CustomerService,"Megabus is almost certainly the worst company in the United States, but might be the worst in the world","Context: Over the last four years, I have ridden Megabus 28 times.  It feels, without strict retrospective scrutiny of each individual trip, like I have gotten what I paid for (read: everything went as planned, without any hitches) on ~14 of those trips.  Of the remaining 14 trips, something has gone mildly wrong (e.g. bus was ~30 mins late) on 11 of them.  Of my 28 trips, I have had 3 catastrophically bad ones.  I have been reimbursed for 2 of these 3; however, last month I took, perhaps, the worst of those 3, and they have yet to reimburse me.  I have attempted to handle it diplomatically with Megabus over the last several weeks, but they have left me no choice, but to turn to social media to vent frustrations about them, and hopefully prompt the action of reimbursement.

On Friday, July 3, 2015, I sent the following email to inquiries@megabus.com during my trip:
Dear Customer Service,

First, let me begin by providing the context that my trip from Chicago to Indianapolis yesterday (7/2 - 3:30 CT departure) and the above return trip was a last-minute trip I booked to attend a family funeral. I was very pleased and relieved yesterday that the bus was at the stop at least 25 minutes early. Given the emotions of the day today, the following issues have been especially disappointing: 

Customer Service inadequacies: 
1. First, I checked the MegaBus app for the location of the bus at 5:41 PM.  The app explained it could not provide information about the bus, so suggested I call Customer Service 
2. I called Customer Service at 5:43 p.m.  I do not remember the name of the agent to whom I spoke, unfortunately, but she put me on hold for 9 minutes, then returned to tell me ""they are trying to research where that bus is, so please try us back in 10-15 minutes.""  I felt like I was being given ""the runaround."" 
Timeliness 
1. Bus arrived one hour late (6:05 p.m.) 
2. After unloading approximately 5 customers and loading, perhaps, 15 customers, the bus finally pulled away at 6:30 
3. 20 minutes into the drive (6:50), we stopped at a rest stop for 30 minutes 
I understand several things about the above: 
1. Megabus' rule is that a departure 2 hours late is grounds for a refund, but the bus was only 1 hour late in arriving at the stop and 1 hour and 25 minutes late departing 
2. It is necessary for drivers to have proper rest in order to get passengers to their destinations safely 
However, these timing factors in aggregate have delayed our arrival into Chicago by 2 hours, at least. 

Driver etiquette: 
1. Driver failed to communicate to the several people who were standing around wondering whether to board that bus (5:05), or the later bus (6:45), leaving me to communicate with them 
2. Driver took approximately 20 minutes to unload roughly 5 bags for those passengers disembarking in Indianapolis 
3. As I boarded the bus, I began to read my confirmation number to the driver (as I have done for many drivers before), and he interrupted to respond ""Hold on, hold on, sir.  You're gonna mess me up. This is what I do."" 
Potential security issue: 
1. As we were about to pull away from the rest stop, a man who had pulled his car into the adjacent gas station approached the bus.  He asked the driver for a ""William Helton.""  The driver requested several times that ""William Helton"" approach the front of the bus, if he was on board.  When no one responded to the call, the driver allowed the man to board and search the bus for ""William Helton.""  The man did not find ""William Helton"" or whomever he was looking for. 
1. Imagine this man had been armed and/or had nefarious intentions!! 
(Last and of least importance) Lack of quality hardware: 
1. As I attempted to plug my computer into the electric outlet, it was evident that the bracket holding it to the seat in front of me is either missing necessary screws/bolts, or it is broken.  The outlet is ""hanging on by a thread,"" so I had to hold my computer charger into the outlet so my computer would charge, as my computer was dead, and it was necessary that I use it to accomplish work on this ride. 

I have ridden the Megabus with relative consistency over the past 4 years (I count 28 trips).  I have certainly remained loyal to it, despite several very disappointing experiences.  But, this overall experience stacks up to be one of my top 3 worst. Because of the cumulative problems with this trip, I respectfully request a refund of my fare. 

Sincerely,


I received the following response from Megabus on Monday, July 6:

After not hearing anything back during the business week, I sent the following email on Friday, July 10:

Natal,

I am checking to see what kind of progress the Operations Manager has made
in investigating my claim and reimbursing me for my fare.

Thank you,

I received the following response on Monday, July 13:

Dear ,

We apologize for the delayed response but due to a high volume of emails at
this moment our Operations Team is answering all emails in a timely manner.
Once the investigation is over you will be contacted by one of our members

Finally, a full 12 days after sending my initial request email to Megabus, I received the following email on Wednesday, July 15:

Dear , 

I apologize for the delayed response. I have further investigated your service and see the bus had arrived at 6:06 PM and departed at 6:26 PM. I truly do apologize for the 81 minute delay. The rest stop is for other passengers since the bus originates from Atlanta with passengers. The man who had entered the bus was a detective who had been searching multiple buses for a suspect. I do apologize for the lack of communication from the driver. We will contact maintenance regarding the power outlets. I do apologize however compensation will not be offered at this time. 



Sincerely, 
Samantha 
Escalations Team

Immediately upon receiving this email, I called Megabus ""Customer Service.""  I put Customer Service in quotes, because it is not really a Customer Service line, but rather a sales/reservation booking line.  I called four times and requested to be transferred to Samantha on the Escalations team.  Each ""Customer Service"" rep told me they ""could not transfer me to the Escalations Team,"" then promptly hung up on me.

So, I replied to Samantha's email with the following on Thursday, July 16:

Samantha,

Frankly, this is an unacceptable response and explanation.  I would like to request an appointment to speak with you, or someone on the Escalations Team, over the phone.

Here is my availability in the coming days:
Friday, July 17
  Anytime
Monday, July 20
  Noon-4:00 p.m. CT
Tuesday, July 21
  Anytime except 11:00 a.m.-Noon CT
Wednesday, July 22
  Anytime

Thank you,


Much to my surprise, I received the following on Thursday, July 16:

Dear , 

You may give me a call at 908-354-3330 EXT 6321. I am here from 6:30 AM-3:00 PM Sunday-Thursday. 





Sincerely, 
Samantha 
Escalations Team

I replied back to Samantha that I would call her on her direct line at 9 a.m. CT on Tuesday, July 21.

When I did call Samantha at 9 a.m. CT on Tuesday, July 21, she was clearly not expecting my call, despite the fact I had told her the day and time I would call.  She took a moment to look up my case, then came back to the call.

Ultimately, our conversation consisted of little more than Samantha repeating what she had written in her July 15 email.  She gave me no further information about the case or the situation and certainly did not offer anything from Megabus.  When I asked to be transferred to her supervisor, she explained she was the supervisor.  When I requested to be transferred to the person to whom she reports, she explained that she ""could not do that,"" and said if I wanted to talk with her supervisor, I would have to write her a letter, and she gave me the mailing address of her supervisor:

Sandra Duvall
349 First Street
Elizabeth, NJ 07206

So, here we are on social media.  At this point, this is not as much about money as it is about principle.

I fully realize that Megabus is a discount carrier, but I am simply flabbergasted that we allow this joke of a company to continue operating in the United States.

At this point, I have given my last hard-earned dollar to Megabus (which is a subsidiary of CoachUSA, which is subsidiary of Stagecoach Group - based in Perth, Australia).  I will make my best effort to discourage my peers, and anyone else who asks me, from spending their hard-earned money on this ""company"" as well.",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/3h4e3p/megabus_is_almost_certainly_the_worst_company_in/,2015-08-15 18:51:58,Booking.com
CustomerService,A bad marriage between AT&T and DIRECTV:  A story of awful customer service,"I have a story that I'd love to share with the internet community that just happened to me recently.  I caution you, it's long but I think a quick and good read. 

I bought a home in March 2012, my wife and I were excited to move into our first house after living the apartment lifestyle for 5 years.  We had AT&T's U-Verse TV and we were always happy with it.  Before moving, we checked U-Verse availability online and it said it was unavailable.  We were pretty upset that we couldn't transfer our existing services and after weighing our options between a combination of Hulu Plus and Netflix or DIRECTV (Comcast was never an option, they to me are the worst and that's maybe a story for a different day), we decided to check out DIRECTV (you can blame my addiction and need to have live sports for this one).  So upon moving week, we got our shiny, new DIRECTV satellite service installed.

All was good for awhile, and except the occasional outage due to a heavy rain storm, we had no problems.  I had still had plans to switch to U-Verse when it became available in my area though so I often checked online to see if U-Verse had become available in my area.  It had been 10 months since I moved and it was still saying we hadn't had U-Verse in my area.  I tried a neighbor's address and guess what I learned, U-Verse was in my area!  I called AT&T and they looked up my address and confirmed that it had been in my area for years and there was a database error and my address was coming up as being listed that service was unavailable.  A database error!  I could have had U-Verse the whole time but I'm locked in the middle of a 2 year contract with DIRECTV.  I ask AT&T, since this was their error and I could have had U-Verse the whole time, would they offer a credit of $200 to help me cover my early termination fee for DIRECTV.  They refused.  I wasn't that upset because as I mentioned before, our service wasn't that bad, and through my promotion with DIRECTV, our bill was cheaper than it would have been with U-Verse anyway.  I said oh well, at least I know in another year, I can switch to my U-Verse service.

Let's talk internet for a minute.  Since U-Verse wasn't available in my area (at least according to their website at the time), I had one internet option, Comcast (cue scary music).  There is nothing worse than paying $60 for so-so internet (I swear I have to always reset my cable modem every other week).  You know Comcast has a problem when I have to go through all the reset steps with their technical support people everytime I call because I'm so dammed used to their scripted routines ""...please unplug the modem from the wall, leave it unplugged 30 seconds and plug it back in....""  I literally have to say I did that before they can say anything just to save us all 20 minutes of time.  Anyway, I digress.  Back in March, I as a new Comcast subscriber for their internet, I was getting it for $30 a month for their 18mb speed.  After 6 months however, I got a bill for $44.  I called to find out why and I was told that my $30 rate was only for 6 months, and then it goes to $44 for 6 months and then back to the full price of $60.  I was baffled, this promo pricing tier wasn't explained when I called to order internet service.  But again, I digress, it's hard not to when talking about Comcast.  But this for once isn't about them, it's about DIRECTV.  You see, it was my internet bill increasing faster than the rate of inflation that caused me to continue checking AT&T's website for internet availability in my area.  So even though I couldn't terminate my DIRECTV contract early to get U-Verse TV, I was eligible to get U-Verse high speed internet.  And guess who partners with AT&T? That's right DIRECTV.

So on January 18, I called DIRECTV and wanted to learn more about their internet partnership with AT&T.  It started out very nice.  The representative at DIRECTV walked me through the internet pricing plans, explained there was a $10 bundle discount, the installation fee would be waived and billing was handled through DIRECTV for both services.  So I set up my installation for January 26, and they said it would be between 9 am and 11 am. I can't wait to call Comcast to cancel my internet!  

Around January 23, I receive a letter from DIRECTV, co-branded with AT&T's logo on it, confirming my order details.  But this letter from AT&T/DIRECTV has the wrong internet plan pricing and says I will have an installation fee of $99.  I actually didn't pay much attention to this as I figured it listed AT&T's main pricing for this order but that since it was through DIRECTV, the correct pricing and waived installation fee would appear on my first invoice as that's what I was told when I made the order.

January 26 comes and I wake up like a kid on Christmas morning.  9:00 comes, I'm looking out the window for the AT&T truck.  10:00, 10:30 and 11:00 all come and go, with no sign of the AT&T installer.  After 12:00 I call AT&T to find out where the installer is and they say that they don't have any order for me for that day.  I am so confused.  I give them the order number and they say that my installation is scheduled for February 1.  I am so confused and I say I was given a date of January 26 (a Saturday).  I could never do February 1 as that is a Friday and I am at work I tell them.  They apologize for the miscommunication and after I said I couldn't do February 1, they move my date back to Saturday, February 2.  After hanging up, I'm not to upset as it's only a one week delay.  My cancelation call with Comcast will have to wait one more week.  Because of this mixup though and the previous order confirmation letter I received earlier in the week from AT&T, I call DIRECTV just to make sure the order is right.  I speak with another customer service representative and they confirm my internet order, they confirm I have my installation fee waived and they confirmed the installation date of February 1.  So either I truly wrote down the date wrong and thought I heard January 26 or they told me January 26 but entered February 1.  But at least the order was right, and both AT&T and DIRECTV had the same info in their systems so my concerns disappear.  The only problem due to this miscommunication was I had to push it back one more day to that Saturday, February 2.  

So now it's Friday, February 1. AT&T keeps calling from their automated system to confirm my installation for Saturday, February 2.  I keep missing this call as I'm at work and in and out of meetings.  So at the end of my day, I call AT&T to speak to a customer service representative to confirm my installation.  They proceed to tell me I am scheduled for internet installation and they go through my plan and pricing.  It's all wrong!  They say I am paying $29.99 and have a $99 installation fee.  I said that isn't correct and when I ordered through DIRECTV it would be $29.99 with a $10 bundled discount and a $0 installation fee.  I asked if I'd be getting a bill from AT&T or from DIRECTV and they said that they bill separately.  The person at AT&T said that they hear this from their customers a lot and have to refer them back to DIRECTV to fix these issues.  Apparently the people at DIRECTV aren't properly trained and don't provide the right details to their customers when selling bundled AT&T services.  The woman at AT&T, her name was Karen, was very friendly and helpful and applied a $10 discount and was able to set up bundled billing with DIRECTV but they couldn't waive my installation fee.  She said we could call DIRECTV to solve that.  So while staying on the line, she calls DIRECTV and we are both sharing the story with a DIRECTV ""customer service representative"".  I put that in quotes as customer service was the last thing this woman with DIRECTV seemed to be interested in doing.  

 If it hasn't gotten interesting yet, it's about to.  The woman from DIRECTV, Wendy, tells me that they can't be held responsible for AT&T's fees.  I told her I get that but two different people on two different dates confirmed I would have no installation fee so why am I being charged one now by AT&T when in fact, when I placed the order with DIRECTV, I was told there would be no installation fee?  She just repeated herself and said they aren't responsible for AT&T's fees.  She couldn't be more robotic than an automated computer line if she wanted to.  She placed me on hold to speak with her supervisor (apparently this takes 20 minutes over at DIRECTV, to talk to a supervisor) about their order reps telling me there was no installation fee.  So while on hold, Karen from AT&T and I were talking and making small talk during the 20 minute delay.  After Wendy, from DIRECTV came back, she said they would have to review the phone calls to see what was said but there wasn't anything they could do about the installation fee.  She then said that her supervisor told her that I was given an email with the order details and the installation fee.  I was floored because I didn't receive any email from DIRECTV after placing my order, and neither did my Spam folder.  I did receive one from AT&T but there was no pricing information.  I asked them to resend the email, to which they replied they did, and guess what, I haven't received that email yet either.  Then they told me that there in fact wasn't any email but a letter in my account and if I signed into my account at directv.com, I could view it.  I looked at my account on directv.com and there is no message saying I would have an installation fee.  In fact, I view my order history and it says my internet order placed on January 18 has $0 setup costs and installation fees.  So quite the opposite of what Wendy and her supervisor were telling me.  At this point, Karen from AT&T asked DIRECTV if they could credit my account $49 and AT&T would match a credit on their end, sharing the responsibility so I wouldn't have to pay the installation fee.  DIRECTV refused to even do that, saying I already had $570 in credits on my account. This really pissed me off.  I asked her what she meant that I had $570 credits. In other words, because DIRECTV offers promotional pricing during the first year of your two year plan, all those credits add up so they can't offer me any more credits on my account.  That's another rant for another day.  

So after 1 hour and 40 minutes on the phone with DIRECTV, they won't do anything for me.  All I can say is I can't wait until March 2014.  As soon as I fulfill my obligation with them, I'm canceling and moving over to AT&T.  Karen was nothing but helpful, courteous and emphatic to my situation.  AT&T should be proud to have a person like Karen in their customer service department.  DIRECTV on the other hand could learn a thing or two.  Before I hung up with DIRECTV, I demanded Wendy to do me a favor and to go ahead and pull those phone records.  I told her based on my recent experience, I knew DIRECTV wouldn't make it right and they wouldn't reply to me but I told her to have her supervisor pull those phone calls and I gave her the exact dates I was told there would be no installation fee (January 18 and January 26).  She could then hear first hand for herself that two different people told me I would have no installation fee.  She said she would go ahead and do that.  Thanks smartass.  Thank you for nothing.    If you find yourself thinking about DIRECTV, I'd advise you to seriously consider a different option.  And if there are no other options, maybe try reading a book instead or playing a board game with a friend or family member.  The people at DIRECTV just don't care about you.",5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/17qod4/a_bad_marriage_between_att_and_directv_a_story_of/,2013-02-02 05:25:04,Booking.com
CustomerService,Liftopia; Mountains of appreciation,"Most often when you write to a business with a concern or a complaint, it's understood that being hostile won't get you far when it comes to customer service. In this particular situation, I took a comedic approach when reaching out to Liftopia customer service via e-mail. 

[Liftopia](http://liftopia.com) is an awesome way to get great deals on ski/snowboard lift tickets for pretty much anywhere. I use the app often and haven't had a problem until the other week when I was unable to use my purchased ticket. The following is the email I sent to Liftopia in a comical way of expressing my situation:
____

Hi Liftopia!

Just like to start by saying I love the app. I think it's a great idea and I have recommended it to countless friends of mine. It really is my first route for lift tix purchasing. 

This past Thursday, however, was not my best Liftopia experience. I had purchased a lift ticket Wednesday night for twilight ski on Thursday at Mtn Creek in NJ. 

Come Thursday around noon, my comrades had bailed on me and was left without a ride there as planned. Instantly I check the FAQ portion of the site, sure enough ""No Refunds"". 

Being the understanding individual I am, and also after reading your explanation of your policy, I simply accepted it as a $31 loss and instead went to Barnes and Noble for a book on photography purchased a Grande Chai Tea Latté and spent the duration of the afternoon there.

Then it started to irk me. 

I would've so rather been on the mountain right then, even though the conditions were probably horrible. Let's face it, it's Mountain Creek. The chair I was sitting in at the bookstore began to feel as if it were filled with rocks, people on their phones with zero consideration became the deafening white noise surrounding me, everything was now getting to me because I had just lost $31 and there was no way I could ever downplay it. 

I slept terribly on Thursday, thanks for asking. 

Just kidding I slept fine. 

My amusement in this email of my  aforementioned particular situation allows me to joke with you a bit in hopes of receiving some sort of discount code or percentage off in the future. Obviously I'm nowhere near asking for a refund, simply ""hook it up"" for me. C'mon Bill (Mike? Steve?), I've at least given a heads up to roughly 20-40 people to get the app and they've all used it. 

This coming Tuesday or Wednesday would be great *nudge*, I am planning on going solo if necessary; luckily my car is out of the shop now. 

Once again, ""No Refunds"", I'm aware of this. I just can't help but see the $31.00 I spent as an origami boat sent out doomed for a flaming arrowed sea burial. Or similar to taking a twenty, a ten, and a one then just placing them in a toilet bowl. Flushhhh. 

Thanks for your time, and I'm abnormally and eagerly awaiting your reply. 

All the best,

E. Fasanella

With low hopes of anything fruitful to be gained, I was surprised when I received a reply e-mail from Liftopia CS rep named Alex:

Albeit, $5 isn't much of a consolation, even when you're expecting nothing, but nonetheless rewarding. I received a survey later on asking how I felt the matter was resolved, so I replied with a suitable glimmering opinion regarding the promptness of the CS response and adequate customer appreciation.

This was not the end of the goods.

Four or five days later, I spotted a bulky 2nd Day priority mail envelope in the letterbox. The parcel contained some sweet Liftopia merchandise.

If you can't see the pic, the package was stuffed with Liftopia stickers, head/wristbands (Gnar!), one of the sweetest can cozies I've ever seen (similar to the old style snap bracelets, the effer hugs the can. Incredible) and a $10 Liftopia gift card. 

This post is dedicated to Liftopia CS, and any other company's customer service team who treats their customers with paralleled consideration and appreciation. Be aware this most likely won't happen to every single person who writes an email to a company, this was just a very nice gesture that I figured I'd share with the world. 

Props to Liftopia for being freakin awesome. 
Props to whoever at Liftopia furthered my email to the merchandising dept which hooked me up with this sweet care package.
Props to whoever invented this snap-wrap-around drink cozie.

Thanks again!",10,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/1zh02t/liftopia_mountains_of_appreciation/,2014-03-03 22:14:34,Booking.com
CustomerService,Amazon Does It Again!,"So I ordered 3 books today from Amazon.com and one of them does not come out until September so it was pre-ordered. The shipment was all from seller ""Amazon.com"" and was over $35 so I was able to get free shipping but it bumped the whole shipment to September. Here is what happened when I contacted Amazon through online chat (I have changed the names and order number for privacy purposes): 
 

Initial Question: I ordered 3 books today and 1 of them is a pre-ordered so I was wondering if I could get the other 2 before the 3rd one comes out?

09:36 PM(GMT) Amazon: Hello, My name is ?????, I'll be happy to help you.
 
09:36 PM(GMT) Amazon: I'll surely help you with the issue, may I have your order number please?

09:36 PM(GMT) Me: It is Order #XXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX 

09:36 PM(GMT) Amazon: Thank you so much.
Please allow me a minute or two while I look into the issue.

09:37 PM(GMT) Me: ok

09:38 PM(GMT) Amazon: I suggest you to cancel the item Seven Wonders and place a new order for the same item.

09:39 PM(GMT) Me: ok, so should I cancel the whole order and just make 2 new separate ones?

09:40 PM(GMT) Amazon: As I can see you have cancelled your item and Estimated Delivery Date: Thursday, February 6, 2014 - Saturday, February 8, 2014 

09:41 PM(GMT) Amazon: Have you cancelled your entire order?

09:44 PM(GMT) Me: I just cancelled the whole order and I am going to redo it. 
The order had free shipping since it was over $35 and it would not be free after I removed Seven Wonders so I am going to find something else to add so I can still have free shipping

09:45 PM(GMT) Amazon: I suggest you to place the order for the 2 item you want and I assure you will not be charge for the shipping,.
Would that be fine?

09:46 PM(GMT) Me: The 2 items were under $35 though so it said it would then be $7.95 for shipping I think
Actually it would be $5.97

09:46 PM(GMT) Amazon: I suggest you to place the order for the 2 item and I assure you will not be charge for the shipping.

09:47 PM(GMT) Me: ok thank you

09:48 PM(GMT) Amazon: Please provide me the order ID once you have placed the order.

09:48 PM(GMT) Me: ok

09:49 PM(GMT) Me: There is no option for free shipping, Standard is $4.98

09:50 PM(GMT) Amazon: Please place the order and I will take care of rest.
09:50 PM(GMT) Me: ok
Order Number: XXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX 

09:51 PM(GMT) Amazon: Thank you so much.

09:52 PM(GMT) Amazon: I have upgraded the shipping to overnight and waived off the shipping charges also and the Guaranteed Delivery 
Date: Saturday, February 1, 2014 

09:52 PM(GMT) Me: Thank you SO much!

09:53 PM(GMT) Amazon: You are most welcome,??????
Is there any thing else that I may help you with?

09:53 PM(GMT) Me: That is all, thank you again!

09:53 PM(GMT) Amazon: Thanks for visiting Amazon.com. Take care!! Goodbye!! Have a Wonderful time!!

CustomerService,UPS overcharged my reddit santa gift,"I entered the reddit santa gift exchange and my secret santa sent my gift through UPS (international shipping). It took a while to get here, but finally I got it and opened it today. 

About two weeks ago, I get a call from a UPS lady telling me that my package contained an item that I couldn't receive and that I needed to sign a letter stating that I surrendered that item in order to receive the rest of the package. She tells me it is a bag of balloons that contains some kind of powder that is not permitted. Confused, I signed the letter so the package could get here. 

After solving that issue, I get another call from the same lady saying that it turns out that the chocolate box in there also couldn't go through customs and that I needed to sign a new letter surrendering it. I asked the lady for the rules that stated that chocolates are not permitted and she replied with one, but it didn't say anything about chocolates. Some friends tell me that it's common that some kinds of foods or snacks are not permitted so I signed the letter.

Next thing, they say I have to pay duties because there are articles that are need to be paid for. I told myself it shouldn't be much and told them to go ahead and send it. 

The package got here last week, but I was on a business trip so I couldn't receive it. A colleague did me the favor of paying the duties, which to my surprise were 1,118.69 MXN (~74.59 USD). I was a little bit shocked since that is a lot of money for a package, maybe it was because the gift was really cool or expensive. 

First of all, I really liked the present; my complain is not towards my secret santa but the bad experience given by UPS. I opened it today, and it contained a t-shirt, a balloon modeling kit (without the balloons) and a book of The Oatmeal :D. Then I thought, how could this be 75 USD worth of duties, this is ridiculous. 

I am pretty unhappy and trying to file complains where I can to get visibility.

CustomerService,Travelocity's poor service stranded me for 12 hours.,"I'm a first-time traveler, and booked through Travelocity.com. The flight consisted of 2 connections. This was not ideal, but I was willing to deal with the inconvenience...to a point.
When I arrived in the location of my third flight, the airport was CLOSED. What's more, I discovered that my connection time for this new flight is 12 hours long. Travelocity provided no hotel or other housing during my connection and I, a teenage girl on her first trip abroad, was stranded outside a CLOSED airport ALL NIGHT, from 9pm to 9am.
As if that dangerous, irresponsible piece of service wasn't enough, I feel the need to add that there were NO warnings as to the closing of the airport in any of the correspondences with Travelocity prior to purchase, and that the information which detailed the connection times of the flights was made difficult to see and to understand. These Travelocity people did not assist me in any way with making a proper decision on my flights.
My return flights involve ANOTHER 12-hour layover in a closed airport, this time from 6pm to 6am! I have tried e-mailing and calling the company, to no avail. The e-mail response is always automated, saying they don't handle flights via e-mail. I have no access to a phone where I am, and tried Skype-ing. The call quality was not ideal, and what I gleaned from the less-than-glowing service rep was that the cost of changing my flights would be half as much as my flights were in the first place! So, I can wait 12 hours overnight in a foreign country outside its closed airport, or I can shell out an absurd amount of cash (which I don't have) for Travelocity to fix an error which should not have been made in the first place.
TL;DR : Travelocity's poor communication and service strands teenage girl overnight in foreign country, 12 hours in closed airport. Customer service does nothing. Travelocity intends to allow this to happen again, to the same person.",6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/v8x0q/travelocitys_poor_service_stranded_me_for_12_hours/,2012-06-18 22:53:06,Booking.com

CustomerService,INCREDIBLY Pissed at Airbnb Coronavirus Stealth Policy Change,"I cannot believe a company like Airbnb would shift their policy change behind the scenes so many times during an epidemic and not explain their changes to their customers.

&#x200B;

We had to cancel a trip we set up prior to March 14th that had two nights after March 14th. According to the following text - which was the Airbnb Coronavirus policy at the time - we were qualified for a full refund.

""Existing reservations for stays and Airbnb Experiences with a check-in date of April 14, 2020, or earlier, and with at least one night occurring between March 14, 2020 and April 14, 2020 are covered. This means that guests who cancel will receive a full refund, hosts will be able to cancel without charge or impact to their Superhost status, and Airbnb will refund all service fees.""

We put in our request in their support messaging center because their lines were extremely busy and waited for a response. We didn't get any alerts and eventually came back to it to see if they responded, at which point they alerted us that we did NOT qualify for a refund. I couldn't understand what I missed, so I went back to look at their policy. The policy I read (and now states) is the following:

""Reservations for stays and Airbnb Experiences made on or before March 14, 2020, with a check-in date between March 14, 2020 and April 14, 2020, may be canceled before check-in. This means that guests who cancel will receive a full refund, hosts can cancel without charge or impact to their Superhost status, and Airbnb will refund all service fees.""

I read that and thought, *How could I be so stupid to misunderstand that policy so poorly?* I felt dumb and started to reply with an apology to all the other guests that were originally coming with us that I promised a refund to. But I thought I'd try and double check if there was any history for the Airbnb policy page.

&#x200B;

So, I went on to the Internet Wayback Machine to see what/if I missed anything. The following link is the wayback machine's version of the policy on March 14th, when we attempted to contact Airbnb:

The policy as it states now is:

I can't stress how livid I am regarding this change. I don't know if it was a mistake at first or not, but I do not appreciate having the rug pulled out from under me. I can assure you this will be the last time I use Airbnb and I will definitely be reporting them to the Better Business Bureau. Will it do anything? Probably not.

CustomerService,Customer service extended warranty roadside assistance scam,"Well to begin with I had a vacation plan had car service and scheduled a trip to Michigan for 7 days. I made all reservations for place no refunds, I took off and made it about 140 miles from my house and the car dumped all the oil so I couldn't drive it. I called Hyundai roadside assistance and it took me a half hour to get to talk to them, then I had to wait for the roadside service to text me. 30 minutes later he texted me and said 1 hour, 2 hours later they were a no show and I had to do it again and it took me another hour. I told them my wife and I were handicapped and elderly and this time they said about 2 hours and 45 minutes well I called rental car company and tried to rent a car and get picked up and they said they don't do since COVID it's about 5:30 pm about 7 hours with out help so I called a mechanic and asked if he could come help me. He went to store and purchased oil and filter for my wife car we had to jack up the car and ruined my clothes getting under car taking cover off motor and the oil plug fell out the mechanic said it wasn't tightened up and then fell out. We finished at about 8:30 pm, well it's about nine in half hours since we called roadside assistance and still no show. We left at about 11:45 pm and they texted me saying that he was almost there I ended up stopping at rest area I was really upset with the service beware of Hyundai extended warranty its good until you need them. This ruined my trip and had a airbnb and no refunds lost a day 200$. Plus had to pay mechanic for going out of his way to help. 3 days later I received a call from a guy who handles service and couldn't believe what happened and told me that they were going to call me back. Well like roadside assistance no show & no call beware before you buy it's a scam to get more money for service you never get .",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/1cr0s9j/customer_service_extended_warranty_roadside/,2024-05-13 14:32:15,Airbnb
