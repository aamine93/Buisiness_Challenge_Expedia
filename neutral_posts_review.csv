travel,Expedia Booked The Wrong Hotel,"I booked a hotel over the phone with an Expedia Representative.  I asked for the Hampton Inn in downtown Green Bay Wisconsin and was told that is what I got.  On the day that I went to check into the hotel I got a confirmation text and Once I arrived in Green Bay the hotel is 20 Minutes outside of Downtown and it's not even a Hampton Inn anymore.  Now I'm trying to deal with Expedia to get a refund and all I can get are Reps who read off script and can't give me any real answer as to if I'm actually going to get a refund, they just keep telling me that management will decide.   Any suggestions on how I should handle this?",0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1d39wma/expedia_booked_the_wrong_hotel/,5/29/2024 11:28,Expedia,Expedia,TRUE,Neutral
travel,Booking.com support not helping,"Hi, I'm currently on a multi city vacation. One of the stay I booked through booking was a normal room for a few nights, smoke free. As we arrive, the whole place smells like cigarettes, all the way up to the room. The room itself reeked like smoke, ashtray and lighter prominent on the table. The window was open to clear the air, but it helped not at all.

For allergy reasons I could not stay, even if I would have accepted the smell. I told the receptionist that I booked smoke-free and not an inch of the place was. I left and found a different hotel.

I described the issue to booking customer service but am getting stonewalled. They are very sorry but can't help me since the hotel doesn't care. They gave me a voucher for 10% of the stays cost. I told them I do not accept this resolution but they ignore me. 

How do I escalate this? The hotel messed up and I do feel unreasonable to demand a significant refund for this.

And advice or similar experiences are welcome. Cheers.",0,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1bonj3f/bookingcom_support_not_helping/,3/27/2024 0:00,Booking.com,Booking.com,TRUE,Neutral
Expedia,"16 months later and still no refund. 2 hours on hold at a time, 30 phone calls later. Still no refund. Does anyone know the address for service for Expedia.com.au?","I've had a gutful. 

It's now been 30 phone calls, over 70 hours on hold, several disconnections, me retelling the same story, and I just keep getting told to wait another 12 weeks for a refund that doesnt happen.

I know more about the 'BSP link' system and the 'GDS' system than any man should rightfully know.

I need an address for [Expedia.com](https://Expedia.com) in Australia so I can take them to court.

I have an address in Sydney, is this the right one?",8,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/okycyj/16_months_later_and_still_no_refund_2_hours_on/,7/15/2021 18:06,Expedia,Expedia,TRUE,Neutral
Expedia,Expedia’s refund dishonesty,"I just wanted to post my most recent experience with Expedia in case anyone has similar issues. I had a flight with Westjet (booked through Expedia) flying from UK - Canada in June that was cancelled. Expedia at no point advised me that my flight was cancelled, it was a friend who had booked directly with Westjet who told me they had cancelled all international flights. 

I then contacted Expedia via their online chat, and they confirmed that the flight was cancelled. They offered to apply for a refund (as I said I didn’t want credit) but that it would take 12 weeks. I said fine, the wait didn’t bother me. Fast forward maybe a month, and I hadn’t heard anything about the refund even being applied for, so I contacted Expedia again to check it was being processed. I was then told, that no I was not entitled to a refund (wrong and illegal) from the website and that it was airline credit. 

The airline credit was already on my Expedia account, despite me saying I didn’t want it previously. I think this has been done deliberately to stop me going for a credit card chargeback (which I will be applying for anyway), but wanted to warn folk for the future.",6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Expedia/comments/hn2uar/expedias_refund_dishonesty/,7/7/2020 20:51,Expedia,Expedia,TRUE,Neutral

Airbnb,"NYC stay just cancelled, can someone explain the new rules to me?","Just received this message from my host for a September stay. “Hi. I need to pull my listing because I don’t have the proper requirements for the new Airbnb rules. Would you mind canceling from your end and I will give you a full refund.” 

What’s going on in nyc and should I expect this to happen again if I rebook with another host?",226,169,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/13x1a4a/nyc_stay_just_cancelled_can_someone_explain_the/,5/31/2023 23:09,Vrbo,Airbnb,TRUE,Neutral
Airbnb,Host claimed i had to many ppl at the residence. AIRBNB cancelled my reservation without taking to me. [USA],"Host called the cops on me and my family for having to many people. I had regestered 9 people , property fits 12. Host has cameras and airbnb cancelled my reservation without talking to me 4 hours in our stay. House was shitty and looked nothing like pictures. 

Can i sue airbnb for throwing my out on the street in the middle of the night for a wrong reason and without talking to me? Airbnb support is still standing with whatever the host provided. Airbnb contact person first agreeded this was wrong but didnt solve my case in time.


Edit: Thank you all for your responses. I assure you 2 things are key to the issue i have. 9 people were there at the property, and airbnb did not provide due process. My family (4 kids included in the 9 ) had to scramble at a very late time because of an error and an opportunistic host. Oh and there was no party outside of making the kids dinner as they played in the pool.
